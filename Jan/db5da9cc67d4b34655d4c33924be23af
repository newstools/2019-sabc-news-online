Two people including a police officer have been killed and one seriously wounded during a shoot out incident at Koffiefontein in the southern Free State. It is believed that police received information of a suspected stolen vehicle on Dassieskop Farm of Paul Nel. Police spokesperson, Thandi Mbambo says while police were on the phone with the farmer, they heard some noise and the phone cut. She says upon arrival at the farm, Mr Nel`s body was found on the front porch with a gunshot wound to the head. The suspect who was apparently hiding in the bushes at the time, fired shots at the police and 27 year old Constable Vuyani March was hit on the head and died at the scene, whilst 41 years old Sergeant George Calvert was shot in the face and rushed to Kimberley hospital for treatment. Police returned fire and the suspect was shot. He died on the way to hospital. Meanwhile, POPCRU has strongly condemned the killing of the police officer. Free State POPCRU secretary Amelia Mahlatsi says: “POPCRU is very sad and frustrated as we don’t have enough support even from the people of the communities we service. You know that people will complain about farm attacks and other things but if people start attacking the police, you ask yourself how are we going to be able to service those particular farms.”
