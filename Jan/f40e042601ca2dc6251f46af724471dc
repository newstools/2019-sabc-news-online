The State Of the Nation Address (SONA) has had some controversies in the past with disruptions and a delay in 2018. With SONA scheduled to take place on the 7th of February National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete expects proceedings to be back to normal in 2019. “If you remember last year already we were maturing, we were quiet, we were sitting there dignified giving everything the president was to say in terms of our attention so I expect that we will have a successful, orderly and dignified state of the nation address as we end our fifth term,” says Mbete Dignified guests at the SONA who have confirmed to attend are former President Thabo Mbeki, former president Kgalema Motlanthe, former National Assembly speaker Dr Frene Ginwala and former national assembly Max Sisulu. An invite to Former President Jacob Zuma had been sent but he is yet to indicate whether he will attend the opening of Parliament or not.
