The African National Congress says it’s not concerned about the Democratic Alliance‘s decision to serve the governing party with a letter, to stop it from using the DA’s “South Africa for All” election slogan. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says they launched their election campaign in September last year. The ANC has used the same slogan as its own in a recent tweet. Malatsi says DA lawyers will serve the governing party with the cease and desist letter on Friday. However, ANC spokesperson in the Presidency, Zizi Kodwa, had this response. “DA appropriated our songs, heritage of liberation struggle, even appropriated Nelson Mandela while he opposed what the DA stands for today. So we are unfazed.”
