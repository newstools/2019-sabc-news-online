The case against a Wits University administration officer and a student, who were arrested on suspicion of fraud and corruption, is expected to resume on Monday morning at the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. The 31 year old Mfundo Thela and 19 year old Bobby Khalla allegedly demanded money from applicants who didn’t meet the requirements for entrance to the university. It’s understood that the pair were allegedly manipulating the system and awarding higher scores to the applicants. Thela and Khalla are due to return to the dock after their case was postponed last week. The case was rolled over to Monday to allow the state time to prepare for a bail application for Thela, who has a previous conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol. His co-accused, Khalla was granted bail of R10 000, on condition that he hands over his passport to the investigating officer.
