Seven suspects have been arrested in connections with the ongoing vandalism of Metrorail trains in the Western Cape. Several trains have been torched in the past few months, mostly along the central line in Cape Town, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott says the suspects were arrested in various areas around the city over the past few days. Scott says they are serious about fixing the rail system in the province. “We’re encouraged, we’ve seen how crime is displaced from one area to the other as soon as we clampdown. The areas where there’s the latest arrests are well-known for anti-social behaviour, it’s a concern to residents and businesses. Metrorail remains open to joint initiatives, we will also engage the chamber and residents associations to join us in the fight against crime.”
