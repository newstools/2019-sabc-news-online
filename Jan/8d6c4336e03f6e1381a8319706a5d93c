The Limpopo Education Department has admitted that there are schools in the province which still do not have textbooks and stationery. Grade nine to 12 learners at Gwamasenga secondary in Tsianda village outside Thohoyandou have not yet been supplied with stationery while grade 12 learners are running short of Business Studies and English literature books. The department’s provincial spokesperson Sam Makondo has blamed increased learner enrolment at schools. “We are accordingly dealing with all those shortages which in the main are as a consequence of increase learner enrolment because some schools as we speak are still admitting learners and that means we must make available the necessary support material so this case is not exception and is getting the necessary attention so that no learner is disadvantaged. We have encouraged our schools to bring to our attention such cases for a swift response,” says Makondo. Meanwhile, the secretary of the School Government Body at Gwamasenga secondary, Emmanuel Muofhe, says they have informed the department about the shortage, but they have not received any assistance. “Actually when we reopen we realised that the exercise books will be available before we start with the lessons but it’s just unfortunate that we are in week two so we have got a serious problem that our learners can’t be able to do activities like homework. We are appealing to the department so that it can be able to provide books so that our learners can be able to proceed with activities that the teachers are involved themselves,” says Muofhe.
