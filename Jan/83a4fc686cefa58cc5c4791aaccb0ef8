The Automobile Association (AA) has cautioned against anticipating a further fuel price decrease next month. This after fuel prices dropped at midnight with petrol prices decreasing by at least R1. 22 a litre. The price of diesel dropped by at least R 1.53 per litre and illuminating paraffin by R1. 23 a litre. AA spokesperson, Layton Beard, says it’s still too early in the month to speculate if there will be further price drops this year. “The fuel price is calculated on an average over the numbers over a month  so when we look at what is going to happen in February, we need to see what the rand does against the US dollar in January and also what’s the trend of international petroleum prices is in January. Once we’ve got that average over the period of a month, we will then have an idea of what’s going to happen in February. So at this very early stage in January, it’s very speculative to say that it is definitely going to lead to a decrease going into February. I think we have to wait a couple of weeks and see what the trend is towards the middle of the month to have a clearer picture,” says Beard. WATCH BELOW FOR MORE:
