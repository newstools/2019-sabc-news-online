The late delivery of stationery and text books to Limpopo schools seems to be an annual occurrence ever since the 2012 text book crisis. Two weeks into the 2019 academic year, various schools across the province are reporting that they are experiencing serious shortages, particularly in the supply of books and stationery. Tlou-Matome and Rapetsoa Secondary Schools are some of the schools that have been hit by the shortage of stationery. For learners, the shortage is posing a serious challenge. This means that they now have to share books and work in pairs and groups. A learner from Tlou-Matome Secondary School says there is a great shortage of books at their schools, and they have to share. School Governing Bodies (SGB) is fuming. Lucet Mathekgana, who’s part of the SGB says, “I’m not happy, as our learners don’t have books and they have to share.” The educational right group, Basic Education For All (Befa), says is demanding action. Befa Deputy Chairperson George Mohlapi says they want government to take action about these schools and provide them with books. Limpopo education authorities have attributed the shortages at some schools to learner migration.
