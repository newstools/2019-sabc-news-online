The Department of Correctional Service’s national spokesperson, Singabako Nxumalo, has dismissed claims that Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso is receiving preferential treatment at the St Alban’s prison in Port Elizabeth where he is being detained. The statement by Nxumalo follows a Sunday newspaper article which claims that Omotoso, is being held in a single cell and is able to preach to his congregants via a cellphone. Nxumalo says a task team has been appointed to investigate the legitimacy of these claims. “We have appointed a task team to look into these fresh allegations. It’s a matter of concern to us but we have a duty to ensure that our policies are adhered to and that all is being done in our centres to ensure it does not fly in the face of justice,” said Nxumalo. Omotoso is currently on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court facing rape and human trafficking charges. Nxumalo says that he hopes the investigation will run its course and urgently give expected outcomes. Click related video below:
