African National Congress (ANC)  Deputy President David Mabuza says the party is doing its best to ensure unity in its ranks, as it heads to the general elections this year. He was speaking in Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal, where he interacted with local residents. Mabuza’s visit is part of activities of the ANC in the run-up to the party’s 107th anniversary celebrations to be held in Durban. Newcastle falls in the ANC’s Emalahleni region. It is facing various challenges – including the killing of party members – which has divided the region. Mabuza says provinces such as the North West will also overcome their challenges. “Looking at the ANC as we stand now, I’m very content with the progress we have made in terms of uniting the party; of course there are spots there and there, you can see in the North West they are still struggling, but finally they will get there. Look at KZN is now fine. The ANC has won in the province, a number of provinces are getting there, I’m happy with the progress we’ve made we’ll still go and urge our members to unite.” Meanwhile, Mabuza says the ANC will continue to fight corruption. “I’m not going to encourage members of the ANC to fight, but remember the ANC has got the duty to fight corruption, it’s not like if we are fighting corruption we are fighting an individual, that individual must fight back, no. We can’t allow corruption… otherwise it’s going to kill whatever we fought for.” Watch for more:
