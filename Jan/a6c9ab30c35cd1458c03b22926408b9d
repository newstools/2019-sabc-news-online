The Department of International Relations (DIRCO) says a South African citizen who’s been arrested in Mozambique on suspicion of being involved in extremist activities will have to face the justice system there. The man named by DIRCO as ‘Andre Hanekom’ is reported to have been supporting a militant group involved in destabilising northern Mozambique. The militant activities are reportedly linked to the deaths of over 100 people. International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has expressed concern over the matter. Hanekom is expected to appear again in court next week. The Department’s spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mabaya, says South Africa can only offer consular services to Hanekom. “They are charging him with the following: Being in an extremist group that has led to problems in the north of Mozambique. They say him and other three people are the leaders who have been assisting with resources and logistics. He is appearing in court next week, he’s already appeared once. He qualifies for consular assistance. The family came to us when they could not find him when he was arrested. We are making sure he is being treated fairly,” says Mabaya. WATCH BELOW:
