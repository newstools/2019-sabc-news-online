Teacher union, SADTU, has called off its planned week-long strike in Johannesburg. The strike had been prompted by the alleged racism faced by black teachers in coloured communities in Johannesburg. In one incident, about seven teachers were allegedly prevented from teaching by parents at a school in Eldorado Park.  On Monday, learning and teaching at some schools in Kliptown and Eldorado Park were disrupted. SADTU chairperson in Gauteng Eddie Kekana says that the strike was called off as the matter at the Eldorado Park School is already being attended to. “It was called off; there was that particular intention that we provided the leadership of the region that it can’t actually take place because the matter is being attended to. So we have trust them to actually go and defuse that particular action or planned action.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
