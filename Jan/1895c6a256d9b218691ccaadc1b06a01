Police in the Western Cape have confirmed that a case of arson is being investigated following a devastating fire at the Moravian Mission Station of Wupperthal near Clanwilliam on the West Coast. The police havenâ€™t mentioned any suspects or their possible motive. The fire gutted more than 50 structures on Sunday, leaving more than 200 people homeless. The Moravian Mission Church of South Africa says this town has never seen such devastation before. The hostel which accommodated about 200 primary school children, a community hall, the rectory and several homes were destroyed in the fire. Families and friends unaffected by the fire have taken in those who have lost everything. Plans are underway to remodel a municipal building into a hostel to accommodate 200 primary school children displaced by a fire. Authorities have appealed to the public to donate food, water and clothing to those affected by the fire. Click link for more
