The South African  National Editors’ Forum(SANEF) says it welcomes the decision by the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to investigate into allegations that journalists were paid by Bosasa. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi testified at the commission on Monday about the facilities management company bribing certain journalists to write positive stories about the company. He also revealed a campaign to discredit journalists who were writing negative stories about the company. SANEF’s Mahlatse Mahlase says, “We welcome the investigation by the Zondo commission.  We note some of the names that were mentioned yesterday.  Some of them are actually former journalists and are not practicing currently while others are public relations practitioners.  We would like to call on the industry, journalists and any member of society who has any information to help the Zondo Commission.” “We outright condemn the practices of Bosasa in actively manipulating and distorting media coverage and intimidating those who were exposing their corrupt relationship with various government departments.  We call on the Zondo Commission and law enforcement agencies to deal harshly with those who undermined and intimidated investigative journalists and journalism, and we call on the individual media houses to also act immediately against those found guilty of receiving bribes,” says Mahlase. SANEF is calling on all sources including colleagues to come forward with evidence and information to help the Commission in its investigation. “We strongly encourage and support the outing of rogue journalists,” says Mahlase.
