Donor funding is urgently needed for the rebuilding of the Moravian Mission Station of Wupperthal in the Cederberg Mountains. The building was destroyed when a fire in late December ripped through half of the village. Assessments are under way to determine the help required. The massive fire nearly erased the area from the map.  There were no deaths but the community’s spirit was almost broken. 53 of  the 113 homes were gutted. The shop, school hostel and hall were also razed to the ground. Early estimates for the damage to the business area alone is R20 million. Donations Coordinator at Wupperthal Disaster Aubrey Van Rooy-Brandt says, “If people want to start donating for the rebuild of Wupperthal I think that is open, people can do that. I know the church and our financial director at provincial office is very precise with transparency and we do have an account with a reference Wupperthal Fire is on there. So people can just be very specific when they start donating financial support towards Wupperthal.” A number of organisations, including the Historical Homes Foundation, have sent teams to determine the extent of the damage, to offer possible support. There are however more pressing, immediate needs. “The on-going need is food, it’s fresh water, fresh food there’s also a need for toiletries, and you know we are accommodating the say 130 children from the local hostel that’s burned down as well. So they also have a need for primary and basic care stuff like toiletries and towels and soap. Even yesterday they told us at the hostel they need brushes and combs and all of those basic needs things,” says Van Rooy-Brandt. The Moravian Church of Southern Africa is the land owner and is leading the consultative process. Given its heritage status, meticulous planning is needed. Rehabilitation and recovery is likely to be protracted. Donations can be paid into the Standard Bank, Cheque Account number 072 906 189  – reference Wupperthal Fire.
