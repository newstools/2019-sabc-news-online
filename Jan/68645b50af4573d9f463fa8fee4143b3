Trade Union Solidarity says the case of the suspension of a Schweizer Reneke teacher will be heard in court before the end of this week. It says Elana Barkhuizen’s suspension is unlawful. Barkhuizen was suspended last Thursday after taking a photo of white Grade R learners seated separately from their black classmates. The union, which is now representing Barkhuizen – says they will get their top legal team to take the matter to court to have her suspension lifted. Solidarity has also provided other photos of a class from last year showing black and white children sitting alongside one another. CEO Dirk Hermann says they have also requested DA leader Mmusi Maimane to reprimand his youth leader Leholo Mpheti for defaming the teacher. “Solidarity will also request the leader of the DA, Mmusi Miamane to take disciplinary action against his youth leader, Leholo Mpheti. Solidarity is also considering civil action following investigations which may include defamation among others.” Click on video below:
