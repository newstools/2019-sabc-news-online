Three people have been killed and five others injured when two cars collided along the R559 in Protea Glen, Soweto, early Sunday morning. ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell says emergency services arrived on scene to find that the two vehicles had collided head-on. “Two men and one woman from a VW Polo were declared dead on the scene and one woman was left injured. Two adults and two children from the other vehicle were left with minor to moderate injuries. All the injured were stabilised and transported to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital for further treatment. Metro police were on the scene for further investigation.” Meanwhile, Limpopo traffic authorities have advised motorists using the N1 destined for provinces like Gauteng to exercise patience. More than 2000 vehicles have passed through the Kranskop Toll Plaza before midday. At the Nyl Plaza, more lanes have been opened for south bound traffic. Spokesperson Matome Moremi-Tauatsola has cautioned motorists to avoid overtaking on lanes meant for north bound traffic. “We have opened about seven lanes going south now, our people should be able to exercise patience they must have the correct money so that they do not have to stop as they arrive at the toll plaza to take the money out at the boots of their cars. As we speak now we can see others are doing wrongs things we call to call upon out traffic officers to immediately intervene.”
