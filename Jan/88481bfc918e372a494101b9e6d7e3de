Some institutions of higher learning were inundated with prospective and returning students on the first day of registration on Monday. This is despite pleas by institutions for students to use online processes for inquiries and checking the status of their applications. Wits University says it will only accept over five-thousand students. However, it says it has put in place plans for those who could not register online. “Next week, for those students who can’t register online, we have got face-to-face registration, for those particular students, who are having difficulty with online registration,” explained Wits spokesperson. At University of South Africa (UNISA), emotions among students have reached boiling point because the institution is not yet offering some programmes due to a systems error. “I’m so disappointed. I wanted to register but if there’s no space, there’s nothing I can do. So UNISA must resolve this, so that we can all register,” says a disappointed student. The CEO of Universities SA, Ahmed Bawa, has advised students who did not apply on time to get in touch with the Higher Education Department which will then find ways of how to place them at available institutions. Thousands of young people have flocked to institutions of higher learning with some trying to apply for the first time. Bawa says he believes institutions are much better prepared this year compared to last year. “We would like to advise students should apply to the Cas system run by the department of higher and education and training which is a facility that will allow the department to work with universities to place students where there are places available,” explains Bawa.
