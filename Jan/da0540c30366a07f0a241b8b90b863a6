The Limpopo provincial government says it will help the surviving victims of last weekend’s drowning incident at the Portuguese Islands beach in Mozambique with trauma counselling. The fourth body of the young South African holidaymakers has been found. The four were part of a group of eight young people who went to Mozambique to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Limpopo Premier’s spokesperson Kenny Mathivha says government will help with providing psychologists to help the families. He says Premier Chipu Mathabatha has assembled a team that will be assisting the famillies and the survivors. The team consisting of psychologists and social workers visited the families and will assist them with the burial process once the process of repatriation has been concluded. It is expected that the bodies will be deported to South Africa next week. Related related video below:
