Deputy Minister of Higher Education Bhuti Manamela  has called on both township and rural schools, to take a leaf out of the book of the Velabahleke High School which achieved a 100% matric pass rate in the class of 2018. Manamela has delivered the keynote address at the school’s celebration, at Umlazi, south of Durban. He has urged all schools in the country to emulate Velabahleke. He says the school is a beacon of hope. “You are an example which many should emulate. This school is a centre of black excellence , an excellence in general not only black excellence but excellence in general because there are many multiracial schools, Model C schools who would want to be in the position which you are – who have even more resources that you have.  It’s black excellence in general. We want to applaud this. This school is known as 100%,” says Manamela. Watch related video for more on the story :
