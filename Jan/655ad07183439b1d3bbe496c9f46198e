More rainfall is predicted across most parts of the country for the rest of the week. The South African Weather Service is forecasting between 60 and 80% of showers for Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo from on Wednesday. Cloudy conditions are forecasted for Free State and Kwazulu-Natal. Forecaster Bransby Bulo says such a huge amount of rainfall is normal at this period. “What’s happening is that there’s a lot of moist tropical air that is coming in down from the north.  That is the furthest parts of Africa into our country.  Usually at this time of the year this is the kind of weather condition that one can expect,” says Bulo Emergency services personnel are on high alert. EMS spokesperson Synock Matobako says they have not been called out to any flood related emergencies so far. However, they are monitoring some of the flood prone hot spots including the Jukskei river that passes through Alexandra’s informal settlements and the Klipvalley river in Soweto. Matobako has appealed to residents to be vigilant. “For people that are living in low-lying areas like Setjwetla and Jukskei to monitor their water level.  As soon as they see the water level rising they should vacate their houses and inform the emergency services and for motorists we are just appealing that they shouldn’t cross flooded roads because that might cause problems for them,” explains Matobako.
