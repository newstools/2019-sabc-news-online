The Gauteng Department of Education has called on parents of pupils at the Eldorado Park Secondary School, south of Johannesburg, not to disrupt teaching and learning. This after dozens of parents protested outside the school on Monday over the termination of temporary teachers’ contracts. The Department says they terminated the contracts of temporary teachers who stood in for permanent teachers during last year’s unrest at the school. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona says: “We are calling upon the community and SGB that they really need to welcome those teachers to go back to teaching. They must be in class so that we don’t waste any curriculum time because any time lost is a major challenge to us as a department.” “It’s a serious set back, we can not afford losing any time, because we still have a year ahead.”
