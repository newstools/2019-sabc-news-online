The inauguration of the President-elect of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Felix Tshisekedi, has been postponed to Thursday. Authorities say logistics have led to the delay of the inauguration, which was initially scheduled to take place on Tuesday. The country’s Constitutional Court has upheld the Electoral Commission’s declaration of Tshisekedi as the winner of the 30 December presidential election. This is after opposition leader Martin Fayulu contested the results of the election. Meanwhile the runner-up in the disputed presidential election of the DRC, Martin Fayulu, has expressed outrage at the endorsement of Felix Tshisekedi’s victory by regional body SADC. SADC made the announcement following a ruling by the Constitutional Court. President Cyril Ramaphosa has also congratulated Tshesikedi. Fayulu says he garnered more than 60% of the votes in the recent national elections. The Catholic Church is among those who have expressed serious reservations about the counting process after the elections. Fayulu says SADC’s statement is a disgrace.
