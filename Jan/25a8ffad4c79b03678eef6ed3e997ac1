Former NPA prosecutor Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach will  appear before the Mokgoro Commission of Enquiry in Centurion on Tuesday. Breytenbach, who left her position to join the DA as a Parliamentarian, is expected to testify among others, about her alleged toxic working relationship with her prosecutorial principals. The Enquiry is probing suspended senior advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office. Breytenbach will be the sixth witness to appear before the Enquiry since it commenced last week. Senior lecturer in Criminal Procedure Law at the University of Pretoria, Llewelyn Curlewis elaborates on what could be expected at the Mokgoro Enquiry. “Pre-dominantly the evidence would be about the ethical duties of the prosecutorial personnel. Remember that these have been involved issues of the Directorate of Public Prosecution for many years, senior advocates and prosecutors in essence and so all in all they’ve been involved in decision making and in house dealing and ethical principles of the prosecutorial authorities, etc.”
