Law enforcement officers have been deployed, to monitor traffic flow and to ensure that vehicles are roadworthy. ‘We lost a sizable amount which is worrisome. Even though it’s not consolidated but it shows that it’s increasing. This time of the year last year we were at 141 and this year we are at 148 which is a very worrying number, says Mpumalanga Community Safety,Security And Liaison, Pat Ngomane. Home Affairs officials will feature at the roadblocks to make sure that passengers have relevant documentation to travel to their destinations.
