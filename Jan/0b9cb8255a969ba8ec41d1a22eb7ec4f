Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has apologised to the families of the Life Esidimeni tragedy for opening old wounds with the a billboard the party erected in Johannesburg. Last week, the DA unveiled the billboard titled “the ANC is killing us” with the names of people killed in Marikana and Life Esidimeni in Johannesburg. The families have accused the party of using the names of their loved ones without consulting them first. Maimane apologised at a memorial service in Johannesburg on Thursday.
