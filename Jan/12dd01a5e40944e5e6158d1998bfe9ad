The man accused of raping a seven year-old girl at the Dros restaurant in Silverton will appear briefly in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. 22 year old Nicholas Ninow is charged with rape, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm and the possession of drugs. He allegedly raped the girl in the toilet of the restaurant last year, while she was on an outing with her family. Her mother became suspicious when the girl didn’t return from the toilet and went to investigate, where she allegedly found a naked Ninow and her crying daughter. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson, Phindi Louw confirmed that Nicholas Ninow will be sent to the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital on Wednesday. He was earlier referred to the hospital for evaluation to determine his culpability at the time of the incident in light of his mental history, his bi-polar disorder and his drug use history. The court appearance is just a formality as a bed has become available for him.
