Somalia has warned the United Nations (UN) Security Council against interfering in its affairs. The country has expelled the UN’s envoy Nicholas Haysom. There has been no explanation given for the expulsion but Somalia’s UN ambassador, Abukar Dahir Osman says the country is in need of support from the UN, not criticism. In his address to the Council, Haysom criticised Somali authorities for the deaths of 15 people during electoral violence. Haysom said the arrest of one of the candidates and the violence that erupted marred the process and was worrying considering that the national elections were due to take place in 2020. Haysom was ordered to leave after he wrote a letter requesting information on the legal basis for the arrest of Muktar Robow who was running for the post of regional president of South West State.
