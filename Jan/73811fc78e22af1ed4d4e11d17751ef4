Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says they are monitoring the investigations at the Menzi Primary School in Tsakane in Ekhuruleni. This comes after a break-in at the newly-opened R105 million school. It’s understood that criminals tied-up two patrollers and locked them in one of the rooms, before stealing all 185 learners’ tablets, teachers’ laptops and data projectors, among other new equipment. Lesufi visited the school Thursday night and held a meeting with the community. He says he is positive an arrest will be made soon. He said, “I must be honest we have been inundated with information. Police have also visited various houses around the area. We really wanted the community to own up. For them also to demonstrate how they can assist us. I had discussions with the police today. I also had discussions with the MEC, our colleague in Cabinet on this matter. We are quite convinced that the information the community is giving us will assist us to make a breakthrough.”
