Firefighters from the Overstrand Municipality, Working on Fire, Cape Nature and the City of Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue services have spent the night battling a large vegetation fire which originated at Betty’s Bay. The blaze ignited on New Year’s Day. It was allegedly started by a flare during New Year’s Eve celebrations. A 34-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the fire which has now burnt thousands of hectares of vegetation, as well as a house and a cottage on a small holding. The fire has spread to the Kogel’s Bay area and firefighters say there will be no further evictions at this stage. The Kogel’s Bay resort was evacuated on Sunday as a precautionary measure. The R44 between Gordon’s Bay and Rooi Els remains closed to traffic as mopping up operations continue.
