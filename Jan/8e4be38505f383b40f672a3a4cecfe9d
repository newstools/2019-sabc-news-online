The case against Kwaito star, Pitch Black Afro, has been postponed to next Thursday in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. The musician, whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo is a suspect in his wife’s murder. He will remain in custody pending his next appearance. Ngcobo faces charges of premeditated murder after his wife of 23 years was found dead in a Yeoville Bed and Breakfast (B&B) on New Year’s Eve. Preliminary investigations found that 41 year-old Catherine “Trisha” Modusane had died of natural causes and an inquest docket was opened. However, the lead pathologist found signs that she may have been murdered, spurring a murder investigation. Neighbours reported hearing the couple arguing the night before. Modusane allegedly sustained injuries to her upper body.
