The African National Congress (ANC) says it is confident that its upcoming national events will be a success despite the challenges that the party faces. Both the January 8th Statement and the National Election Manifesto launch will be held in the troubled KwaZulu-Natal. The party says it still enjoys significant support in the province. It’s five days to go until the ANC celebrates its 107th birthday; and party faithful from across the country and the globe will descend on KwaZulu-Natal. Party leaders have laid out plans for the upcoming festivities and their readiness to host two significant events for the party. Initially, the main January 8th event was to be addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pietermaritzburg. The area falls under one of ANC’s most troublesome region, Moses Mabhida. The region is plagued by infighting that’s lead to political killings. It’s rumoured that the event was moved to Inanda due to instability in the region. However the party refutes the claims. On Friday the focus will shift slightly as the ANC’s NEC will meet to hold the National List Conference and consolidate the list for the provinces and the national assembly. But questions still remain on the beleaguered North West province that has been unable to hold its list conference. Some of the names believed to have made the provisional list include that of former President Jacob Zuma and former Minister Malusi Gibaga. However all names will be subjected to scrutiny.
