Police watchdog boss Robert McBride is remaining mum on his next course of action against Police Minister Bheki Cele. This after Cele reiterated on Thursday that he would not be renewing Mcbride’s contract of employment for a second five year term which comes to an end in February. The IPID boss had threatened to take the Police Minister to court if he fails to disclose reasons why his contract would not be renewed. He also argues that Cele had to consult Parliament before reaching the decision. Cele however maintains that McBride “cannot claim right or legitimate expectation” on the renewal of his contract. IPID spokesperson, Moses Dlamini, says they are not commenting on the matter for now.
