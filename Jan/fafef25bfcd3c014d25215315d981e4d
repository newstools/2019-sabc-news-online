Ten antelope have been euthanised after sustaining several injuries in the large vegetation fire in the mountains above Kogel Bay outside Cape Town. The fire, which started in Pringle Bay on New Year’s Day, moved towards Kogel Bay on Sunday and is now 80% contained. A 34-year-old man has since been arrested in connection with the fire. Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service Spokesperson Theo Layne says just over 8000 hectares of vegetation has been burnt so far. He says the R44 between Gordon’s Bay and Rooi Els remains closed to traffic due to the fire.
