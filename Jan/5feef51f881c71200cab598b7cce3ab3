Moshoeu died in April 2017 after falling off the bakkie they were travelling in. They were also found guilty of kidnapping, intimidation and pointing a firearm. Moshoeuâ€™s death sparked violent protests in the area that saw several houses and businesses in the town being burnt to the ground. Watch related video below for more on the story:
