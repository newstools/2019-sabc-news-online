The National List Committee representatives who were sent to oversee the North West provincial List Conference are expected to finally send the delayed conference results to the African National Congress (ANC) headquarters on Tuesday. The conference, marred by differences and intimidation, was postponed more than once before it finally concluded on Monday night at Orkney in Klerksdorp. North West delegates and party supporters are still divided between those who still support chairperson of the disbanded Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) Supra Mahumapelo, while some are behind the Provincial Task Team (PTT). The conference has however failed to meet the deadline of the national list conference, which took place over the weekend in Durban. Provincial PTT Spokesperson Kabelo Mataboge says the list will be made public only after it’s submitted to the party’s national office. Watch the video below for related news:
