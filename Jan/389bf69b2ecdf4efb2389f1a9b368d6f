An Ukhozi FM DJ is in a critical condition at a Pietermaritzburg Hospital following a car hijacking incident in the provincial capital on Sunday night. According to the mayor of Msunduzi Municipality Themba Njilo says he was called to the scene on Sunday night where he found the injured radio personality. Njilo says the radio presenter survived several bullet wounds. “It is a painful for me to announce that one of the assets and well known presenter on Ukhozi was shot last night and people were trying to hijack his car, unfortunately they failed and they fired several shot in his car. He managed to drive to his family members and who took him to the hospital. Last night when I was with him they managed to take out about five bullets and one bullet is still stuck,” says Njilo.
