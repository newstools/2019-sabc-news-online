The African National Congress (ANC) has spent a large part of its 107th anniversary celebrations championing the progress the party has made since 1994. Party President Cyril Ramaphosa has lamented the high levels of abuse that women are subjected to. He was addressing a rally at Inanda north of Durban. The party is expected to present its election manifesto this weekend. Ramaphosa has described the high levels of abuse against women as a national crisis. “But we must hang our head in shame that even as we make progress in forging a non-sexist society, women in our country continue to be confronted with unprecedented levels of abuse, violence and murder often by those closest to them. This is a national crisis.” He also highlighted the positive strides that have been made since the country’s dawn of democracy. Ramaphosa says the party’s 107th anniversary is a moment to look at the contribution of former ANC leaders to the advancement of the party’s collective vision. He says an independent judiciary and a free press are some of the highlights in South Africa’s democracy. “We can report that SA as he (Nelson Mandela) wished is a united, non-racial, democracy. We have a progressive constitution that recognises the injustices of the past and requires that we take all necessary steps to achieve redress in all areas of life. We have durable democratic institutions, an independent judiciary, a free media and active citizenry.” Click below for more on the story:
