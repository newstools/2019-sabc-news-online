Limpopo premier, Stan Mathabatha, has called for survival orientation programmes to be offered to tourists on the Portuguese Islands in Mozambique to prevent drownings. Mathabatha was speaking at the funeral of 24-year-old Mmatholo Mogafe and 20-year old Lesego Matsepe who drowned with two other South Africans on the island two weeks ago. Two others were laid to rest in Mpumalanga and the Free State on Saturday. Mathabatha has told mourners that his government has done its best to ensure that the bereaved families give their children dignified funerals. “They say in the past 10 years there are more than 20 people who disappeared on the island who still have not been found. That is why when first heard about the drowning, we immediately dispersed all our rescue machinery because the area/s whether is very unpredictable that is why something needs to be done to ensure that visitors are oriented about the dangers and precautionary measures to take while on the Island,” says Mathabatha.
