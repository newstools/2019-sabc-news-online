Police are on high alert on Monday morning as threats of more protests in Krugersdorp on Gauteng’s Westrand emerge. A social media post is being circulated calling on residents to intensify their protest action and “shut down” Krugersdorp. Eight polling stations could not open on Saturday due to community protests in the West Rand area. It’s believed the residents are unhappy over a number of issues including alleged drug dealing and human trafficking. Police spokesperson Solomon Sibiya says, “With the message that has been going around about the protest of today, we have been aware that it has been going around since last week and we have taken note of it and we have deployed the necessary powers to Krugersdorp.”
