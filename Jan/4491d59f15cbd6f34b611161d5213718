African National Congress (ANC) Deputy President David Mabuza continues with his campaign trail of community engagements in KwaZulu-Natal. Senior ANC leaders are engaging communities as part of its 107th anniversary celebrations. They are also preparing for the ANC manifesto at the Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday. Mabuza will visit the troubled Moses Mabhida region where a number of ANC leaders have been killed in recent months. It is one of the regions that did not hold its regional conference. A task team has been deployed to the area to help coordinate the partyâ€™s election campaign in the region. Mabuza will conduct a door to door campaign in Howick where he will mobilise the community for the manifesto rally and engage with the community on service delivery issues.
