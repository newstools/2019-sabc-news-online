The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department says it is conducting an internal investigation after a teacher was arrested for allegedly drugging and raping a 15-year-old learner at a school in Pinetown west of Durban. It is alleged that the incident took place last month. The teacher had allegedly offered the learner a lift home but instead took her to another place where he drugged her before repeatedly raping her. The teacher is expected to appear in court soon. Education MEC  Mthandeni Dlungwana says the teacher resigned but the department rejected his resignation. “We are dealing with another issue of Mqhawe here under Pinetown in iNanda where again one of our teachers in December was found to have raped one of our learners. There are a number of other allegations that we are investigating against some of our teachers. We have raised these issues, also you know among society, the community that in such instances they must be reported.”
