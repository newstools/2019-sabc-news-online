Former President Thabo Mbeki has called for dialogue in the Ivory Coast. This follows the release of former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo from the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mbeki says they welcome the development which they hope will contribute positively to Ivory Coast in its pursuit for sustainable peace, national reconciliation and justice. The International Criminal Court on Wednesday ordered the release of Gbagbo, a day after his shock acquittal over post-electoral violence in which 3 000 people died. Judges rejected a bid by prosecutors to keep the 73-year-old fallen strongman in detention pending an appeal against the decision to clear him of crimes against humanity in the west African nation. During his presidency, Mbeki mediated in the political standoff in the Ivory Coast. In a statement, the Thabo Mbeki Foundation says it stands in support of the views expressed by the Africa Forum – the forum of former African Heads of State and Government, in its letter submitted to the ICC prosecutor, Mrs Fatou Bensouda, on September 09, 2015, appealing for the release of President Gbagbo. In the letter, the Forum said it had made its appeal in the “…context of our serious concern that Cote d’Ivoire should continue to grow and develop for the benefit of all its citizens, in conditions of peace, democracy and the rule of law, national reconciliation and unity” and that “that Mr Laurent Gbagbo should be allowed to make his important and unique contribution in the pursuit of peace and reconciliation in Cote d’Ivoire.” “We therefore make an urgent call for all Ivorian parties to engage in an immediate process of dialogue. As the Foundation we stand ready and committed to assisting to ensure this process,” the Foundation added.
