Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu has found that the City of Tshwaneâ€™s controversial multi-million-rand Glad Africa tender is irregular. He says it does not comply with chain management regulations. This means the R318-million that the City of Tshwane has paid the Midrand-based engineering company is irregular. The amount is part of the R1.8-million that the metro incurred in irregular expenditure in the 2017-2018 financial year. The embattled City Manager, Moeketsi Mosola, has insisted before, that the contract is above board and any allegations of transgressions are baseless. The Auditor-General is also pointing fingers at the Mayor, Solly Msimanga, for failing to perform his oversight duties over the City Manager.
