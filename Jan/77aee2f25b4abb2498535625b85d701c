The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has announced that it’s now investigating allegations levelled against its secretary Dr Khotso De Wee, who has been implicated in the evidence of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. The Commission released in a statement Friday afternoon, that it is taking the allegations in serious light. Agrizzi, who is continuing to give his testimony at the commission in Parktown in Johannesburg, implicated De Wee in his affidavit as one of the Senior Officials of the Department of Justice who were paid bribes by Bosasa. This was in regards to a tender in 2013 for the establishment of a security system. De Wee will no longer report for work, and has since taken special leave, pending the outcome of the investigation. During his testimony at the Commission, Agrizzi also implicated former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Agrizzi, testifying before the commission underway in Parktown, in Johannesburg, says the company spent more than R6 million a month in bribes.  Alleged donation made to Ramaphosa’s son Agrizzi has denied leaking the affidavit of the company’s former auditor Petrus Venter which revealed a donation allegedly made to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s son Andile, that was allegedly intended to fund Ramaphosa’s 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Ramaphosa has denied knowledge of any such donation. Venter was allegedly instructed by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson to make a payment of R500 000 to Andile’s foundation. This information was leaked in parliament late last year by DA leader Mmusi Maimane. Agrizzi says when the payment was made, he didn’t want to get involved.
