The Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, has challenged the coal mining industry to defend itself from the negativity it is receiving as the world is moving to cleaner sources of generating energy. Speaking at the 14th Annual Southern African Coal Conference in Cape Town, Mantashe says the coal industry has contributed about 7% to the GDP. He says this figure can grow if coal production is managed properly. Mantashe says the coal industry is under siege and coal producers must stand up and defend it. “There is an agreement that says coal generated power is 95% of SA coal. I disagree with that because it is a propaganda narrative to attack coal. Let me give you an example; renewable energy contributes 5% now there is nuclear energy just north of Cape Town which contributes another 5%. There are picking stations oil and gas, it’s not 95%.”  The Minister believes that coal mining can co-exist with other mining activities. “Coal producers must not be in denial, they must respond to this threat scientifically and to this end it would be important for coal producers to find research initiatives that looks into alternative uses of coal and alternative markets and that include research on cleaner generation of coal.”  Mantashe has reassured investors of policy certainty and invited them to invest with the country. “When we compiled the charter it removed lot of uncertainty, therefore I can stand here and say South Africa is a good investment destination for mine and coal and i encourage investors to come and invest in South Africa.” The conference continues until Friday.
