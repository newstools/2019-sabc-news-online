The family of one of the stampede victims at prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s church says they believe the church was trying to cover up the deaths. The 69-year-old Sarah Mohala’s body together with two other women were taken from the church at the Tshwane Events Centre in Pretoria to a private mortuary in Atteridgeville last Friday. Mohala’s daughter, Patty Koole, says officials of the Enlightened Christian Gather Church were not helpful when they were trying to find their mother. She says they had to get the police to help them to access the mortuary where her mother’s body had been taken. The police are investigating a case of defeating the ends of justice against the church. The church has suspended a head pastor pending investigations and has offered to compensate the family. Koole says she’s very angry with the church. “How on earth do you do that to another human being, a child of God? They pray on a daily basis saying they praise God and then our parents are going there and being chased around looking for miracles. Is this the miracle that my mother deserved, to die like a dog. I don’t know how many people stood on her, maybe she was a doormat, screaming. How on earth do you allow something like that to happen?” says Koole. Watch a related video below:
