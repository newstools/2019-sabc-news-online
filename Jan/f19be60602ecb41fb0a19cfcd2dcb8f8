The Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, has cast aside criticism that his party is not electable because it draws its support mainly from white people. Maimane says the non-racial character of the DA is evident in the outcome of the last municipal elections, where his party managed to form governments including Nelson Mandela Bay, where they secured over 48%. Maimane was speaking at the Cape Town Press Club about his party’s plans ahead of the upcoming national and provincial government. “If I took you to Mamelodi in Tshwane, Soshanguve, look at 2016 we got 20% of the vote there. It’s bigger than any of the so-called electable black parties that you put forward. So on the basis of real numbers, you could not sustain the argument that those who vote for the DA are only white people. Frankly 48 % of the people in NMB who voted for Athol Trollip to be mayor you could not say 48% of a people in NMB are white South Africans,” says Maimane. Watch a related video below:
