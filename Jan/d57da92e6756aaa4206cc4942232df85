The Democratic Alliance (DA) says nearly half of the learners who enrolled in Grade 1 in 2007, didn’t write the full-time matric exams in 2018. The party says these learners are either stuck repeating grades or being lost to what it says is the African National Congress’s failing education system.  The DA’s Shadow Minister of Basic Education, Nomsa Marchesi was commenting on the latest matric results announced last night. “We must also confront the shocking truth which is the matric pass rate which is thirty seven point six percent if you include the number of 2016 Grade 10s who actually passed matric in 2018. These Grade 10s should be celebrating but unfortunately they’ve been lost within the system, which means that more than half didn’t write matric, which means only thirty seven point six percent of these Grade 10s passed matric,” says Marchesi.
