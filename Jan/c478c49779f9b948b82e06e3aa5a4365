North West Education MEC Sello Lehare is on Thursday morning expected to visit the Schweizer Reneker Laer Skool following allegations of racism at the school. A video has gone viral on social media showing a group of black grade R learners separated from their white classmates. The school principal has declined to comment on the matter. The department’s spokesperson Freddy Sepeng says they are investigating the matter. “But we are not sure as the department whether those pictures are a true reflection or maybe, photoshopped, but as the department we are investigating and this morning, honourable Mr Sello Lehari will be going to the school, so that we can be able to find out what had happen,” says Sepeng.
