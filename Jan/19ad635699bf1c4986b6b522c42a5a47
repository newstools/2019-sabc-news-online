The South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) has called for more oversight of so-called radical churches in the country. This comes as SANCO calls for Pastor Shepherd Bushiri to be deported back to his home country Malawi, following a stampede at his Enlightened Christian Gathering church, where three people lost their lives. On Saturday, fresh protests erupted close to the church as protestors again called for his deportation. SANCO spokesperson in the Greater Tshwane Region, Bafana Nhlapo says they are not targeting Bushiri alone but rather making a call to protect parishioners in the country. “There have been a number of things that have been happening and the church leaders have not accounted for them. So our position on the issue of Bushiri is not something that we have done just no, it’s only that it was triggered also by the deaths that have happened in that particular place of worship. What we are saying is that, there is this thing happening in our communities where people are being fed snakes, fed rats, made to drink.  Our call is that all these churches if you check them most of them are run by foreign nationals and there seems to be no accountability around these issues.” Police say no one has been arrested yet in the case of defeating the ends of justice following a stampede at Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering in Pretoria.
