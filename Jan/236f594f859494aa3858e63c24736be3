The ANC’s acting spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa says the extended ANC NEC taking place in Umhlanga, north of Durban on Sunday is continuing the debate around the January 8th statement as well as the party manifesto, after concluding matters regarding the party list. South Africa is scheduled to go to the polls in May this year in a national election which could prove to be a major test for the governing party. President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised a new path for the ANC after allegations of state capture and widespread maladministration. The DA, EFF and other opposition parties are hoping to make substantial gains against the ANC in the provincial and national poll. Kodwa says the ANC remains focused, “We consolidated the list in terms of national to national. We were discussing it is still an extended NEC and alliance partners discussing the manifesto of the ANC will then be focusing on what the manifesto is about because what is important is not to have a basket of promises but commitments because we got experience in government. It is not like we are doing political adventure, we know what it means to be in government for 25 years. We have done better to change the South Africa to be what it is now, what are the things we need to do urgently. We are combining a manifesto and January 8 statement, we are dealing with these issues today.”
