A Limpopo officer has escaped death after the police van he was travelling in was nearly swept away on a flooded road at Senwabarwana, west of Polokwane. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says the 51 year-old officer alighted and climbed behind the police bakkie. He was rescued by community members. The officer was part of a team that was responding to a robbery call at two schools in Avon and Marobjane villages, where armed robbers had stolen various items. “A police sergeant attached to Senwabarana police station was rescued by community members after a police vehicle that he was driving was trapped in flood waters along the road between Machaba- Avon Marobjana road at Ga-kgoshi Maleboho. The provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has thanked members of the community for coming to the rescue of our member who nearly perished in the flood. The member was part of a team of police responding to a business robbery in the area,” explains Ngoepe.
