Zimbabwe’s ruling party, Zanu-PF has launched a scathing attack against Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane. This follows Maimane’s announcement on Monday that the party will approach the International Criminal Court to investigate the Zimbabwean government. Zimbabwe is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and is not obliged to cooperate with the court. Zanu-PF says Maimane has assumed what it terms an aggressive posture for the gallery, when the Government of Zimbabwe has an open door policy to citizens and the international community. Members of the African National Congress’ National Executive Committee on Tuesday met with Zanu-PF Politburo officials in Harare. Zanu-PF Spokesperson, Dr Simon Moyo says liberation organisations in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region must continue to support each other. Meanwhile, the leader of Zimbabwe’s opposition, MDC party, Nelson Chamisa says they will use all means to fight what he calls the brutal manner in which Zimbabwean security forces are handling the opposition. Speaking during a media briefing in Harare, Zimbabwe, Chamisa said they will use their constitutional right to defend themselves. The MDC has also called on the international community and SADC to intervene. Zambia in its capacity as the Chair of SADC’s Organ on politics, Defence and Cooperation has expressed its concern about the situation in Zimbabwe. In an exclusive interview with the SABC, Zambia’s Information Minister Dora Siliya said the challenges facing Zimbabwe have an impact on other SADC countries and that the regional body must support Zimbabwe.
