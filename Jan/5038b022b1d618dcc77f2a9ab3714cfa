The African National Congress (ANC) will celebrate its 107th anniversary with President Cyril Ramaphosa leading a wreath laying ceremony at the grave of the party’s founding president John Langalibalele Dube at Ohlange Institute in Inanda township outside Durban on Tuesday morning. This is part of a build up to the main celebrations scheduled for Saturday at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Ramaphosa will kick off his day with a walk-about at the Pinetown Taxi Rank where he is expected to interact with commuters and drivers. This will be followed by an early morning service at the Central Methodist Church in the Durban CBD with a mini rally at the birthday place of the party’s founding president in the afternoon. In his message, the president is expected to call for unity in a sharply divided province as the ANC prepares for what many believe could be hotly contested polls. For the past few days, ANC top officials have been in KwaZulu-Natal to mobilise communities for the party’s birthday celebrations and its 2019 election manifesto launch. Other top officials are also being deployed in the province to mobilise communities for the main celebrations on Saturday.
