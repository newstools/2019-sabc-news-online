eThekwini ANC councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza and two co-accused Nkululeko Nojiyeza and Sandile Mvelase will reappear in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court, south of Durban, on Thursday for a further bail application. They are facing charges of plotting the murder of the eThekwini branch’s secretary Sbusiso Maphumulo in October last year. Nojiyeza has denied suggestions that there was animosity between his fellow party councillor Maphumulo. Maphumulo was shot dead outside his home after attending an ANC meeting. Meanwhile, Magistrate Thulani Mbuyazi advised witnesses to be more forthright in their evidence. Mbuyazi is due to rule on the bail application on Thursday.
