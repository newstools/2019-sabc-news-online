President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for zero tolerance of racism, sexism, bullying, violence and other forms of anti-social behaviour at schools. He has called on the government to stand firm against school governing bodies that deny children access to schools on the basis of their linguistic backgrounds. The President was addressing the 2019 Basic Education Sector Stakeholders Lekgotla in Johannesburg on Monday. Basic Education officials are paving the way to improve the lives of future leaders. The three-day Lekgotla reflects on the journey travelled since their last summit last year. Challenges in the education sector continue to persist with vandalism of schools a major concern. President Ramaphosa has appealed to South Africans to work together and shape the country’s future through education. “Allow our children to be denied access to education because we as adults have certain grievances that we want to raise to one another, denying our children their right to education in the end places the future of our kids jeopardy.” President Ramaphosa has also appealed to all those involved in education to look very carefully to the fourth industrial revolution. “The fourth industrial revolution is upon us, so therefore make sure that you prepare our children for what is coming in the recent future, making sure they are ready for new technologies.” However, it would seem more still needs to be done to achieve this says Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. “We need to make sure that all is done well on the grassroots level so that we can be certainly ready and up for the fourth industrial revolution.” The President has also commended the Basic Education Department for the improvement in the pass rate of the 2018 class of matriculants.
