The African National Congress (ANC) says it has no knowledge of threats against the Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal. This comes after the DA said the ANC had allegedly expressed anger that the DA had chosen to use the site of the capture of Nelson Mandela in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands to launch the party’s Team One KZN spokespersons. Provincial ANC Spokesperson, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, says if the allegations were true the DA would have opened a case with police. “The principle of Freedom of Association is what the ANC fought for and it’s what it stands for moving forward. So, we are really not aware of that plan. Having said that, I do not believe it is a genuine concern that the DA is raising because if they were genuine and have received genuine threats, I think the first thing they would have done was to go to the police and report the matter and the police would of attended the matter because the SAPS are there to represent all citizens regardless of their political affiliation.”
