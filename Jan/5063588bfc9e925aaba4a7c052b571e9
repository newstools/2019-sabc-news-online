Scores of East London residents have raised concerns about the high levels of drugs on the streets, illegal shebeens and police officers that are allegedly working together with criminals. They raised these concerns at an imbizo attended by Police Minister Bheki Cele. He has visiting Buffalo City Metro for the second time this month. The area is plagued by high levels of crime, drug dealing and lack of policing resources. Residents say they have had enough. The quick access to drugs on the streets, liquor outlets that run day and night, and allegations of brown envelope policing topped the list of complaints. Residents say they want the Minister to attend to these. “There are rotten potatoes among the members of SAPS and it’s time that the Minister does something, take the rotten potatoes out and replace them with good people,” says one of the residents. Cele says they are looking into these complaints. “Definitely there are several areas to be responded to, others quicker than others especially things like illegal shebeens and those legal but not compliant. We will respond to those much quicker. The raised issues about our members will be followed. We have requested them to give lists of those they’ve complained about but there should also be evidence not just allegations.” He has promised to return to East London to give progress to the residents. He has also promised that they will continue to work hard to fight crime.
