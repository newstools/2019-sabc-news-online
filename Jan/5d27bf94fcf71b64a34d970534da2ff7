The Democratic Alliance (DA) has unveiled a billboard outside the Joburg CBD, emblazoned with the words “The ANC is killing us.” The party says the billboard is a memorial to those that died as a result of the African National Congress’ failures and lack of care for the people. Party leader Mmusi Maimane says the ANC government has blood on its hands and must be held accountable. The billboard lists the names of all the victims, with the thousands of DA members in attendance observing a minute of silence in their honour. “The ANC is killing us and today the 144 who died in Life Esidimeni, the ones who died in pit latrines, the ones that died in Marikana; today (Wednesday) as the DA we stand together and say we cannot reward a government of killers. We cannot reward a government that is murdering and killing our people. We want a government that will work for all our people.”
