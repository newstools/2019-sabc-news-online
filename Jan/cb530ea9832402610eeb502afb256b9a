African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says unity within the party is gradually improving but admits that it has not been smooth-sailing. Ramaphosa was a guest on SABC’s Nguni current affairs shows after he delivered his January 8th statement – which is part of the ANC’s 107th anniversary celebrations in Inanda, north of Durban. Ramaphosa says only a few regions are lagging behind with regard to unity. “Yes, we are uniting as the ANC. Yes, when we started to engage after the 2017 conference it was difficult. Things were not moving accordingly, because there were two factions pulling in different directions. But now we have found each other because the conference mandated us to unite as ANC and for the leadership to lead the process of rebuilding and fostering unity in the organisation.”
