The Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has dismissed Ajay Gupta’s application for leave to appeal to cross-examine former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel. Lawyers for the Gupta family applied for the right to cross-examine Manuel about his upcoming testimony about former Minister Fikile Mbalula’s suspicions that Atul Gupta had unlawfully interfered in his appointment as Sports Minister. Justice Zondo had previously ruled that cross examination by the Guptas will be done in South Africa. “I’ve heard the application brought by the Guptas. (Mike) Hellens, who appeared on his behalf, presented arguments in relation to the basis on which I previously dismissed his application for leave to cross examine him in the ruling that I made. Having listened to him I am of the view that there is no basis for me to grant Ajay Gupta leave to appeal to cross examine because the hurdle which stood in his way in terms of that judgement remains.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
