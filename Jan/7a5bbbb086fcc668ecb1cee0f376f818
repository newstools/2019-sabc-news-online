DA leader Mmusi Maimane has described as ‘unacceptable’, allegations of racism at the Schweizer Reneker Laer Skool in the North West. This comes after a video went viral on social media, showing a group of black Grade R learners separated from their white classmates.  The school principal has declined to comment on the matter.The North West Education Department says it is investigating the alleged incident. Maimane says the DA is engaging with the school to encourage an environment that’s accepting of all race groups. He says: “We are engaging the school to build a culture in which all students, regardless of race, are integrated and included in a diverse classroom that works together, not separate developments.” “I find that completely disturbing. It is unacceptable in a democracy of today. I hold strong to the value of a diverse society and such an image is unacceptable. We have to build schools that are diverse. We have to build communities and centres that are inclusive to all South Africans.” adds Maimane. Meanwhile, members of the EFF and the Forum for Service Delivery are picketing outside LaerSkool Schweizer Reneke in North West. EFF member of the provincial legislature Thabo Sehloho says this reeks of racism. “There is a serious racism that is taking place, but we are worried about the young people that they are exploited by racism that is taking place here. So, we are here because we want to send a clear message to this lazy MEC of North West, who failed to attend to this matter of racism across the province. It is not only this school that is experiencing racism. You’ll understand there’s a school in Rustenburg, that also experienced racism, and the MEC was quiet about it.”
