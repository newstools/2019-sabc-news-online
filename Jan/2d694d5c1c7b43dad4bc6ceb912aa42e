Fears are mounting of further violent protests in Zimbabwe on Tuesday following Mondayâ€™s deadly clashes between police and demonstrators in Harare and Bulawayo. Authorities say at least 200 people were arrested and an unspecified number killed in the protests over a massive increase in fuel prices announced over the weekend. Protesters burnt tyres, barricaded roads and torched cars in Harare and Bulawayo with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds. In rand terms, it now costs over R43 to buy a litre of petrol in Zimbabwe, making it the most expensive in the world. The government has blamed the opposition, Movement for Democratic Change Alliance (MDC), for the escalation in tensions. Zimbabwean people say the situation in their country is worsening, as they cannot afford basic commodities. Click video below:
