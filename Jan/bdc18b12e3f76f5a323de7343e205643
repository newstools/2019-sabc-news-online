Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the introduction of technology in schools has proven to be successful and has helped with the matric pass rate.  This is despite the heavy criticism the department received when it introduced the programmer a few years ago. Lesufi was speaking at University of South Africa (Unisa) in Pretoria where he released the province’s 2018 matric results.  The province’s top achievers also received accolades. Gauteng was the best performing province and achieved an 87.9% matric pass rate. Lesufi says they’ve been vindicated.  “When we introduced out ITC schools, we were under pressure, we were told it’s a waste of money and there’s no way that we were going to improve township schools utilizing technology.  We are proud to report back to society that the school that we launched out ICT in Tembisa is performing very well, with 63%.   Meanwhile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the province will not rest until township schools also get to achieve top matric results. “Children from the townships can get the best education they have ever had, we can’t say we are improving our education. We measure ourselves about the townships, how is education doing in our townships.” Makhura, says matrics in Gauteng are the “top Dogs”.  The premier congratulated the class of 2018 for being ahead of all the provinces. Makhura says the investment in education is starting to pay off.
