The Chairperson of Parliament’s Police Portfolio Committee Francois Beukman has welcomed the multi-million rand drug bust in Port Elizabeth earlier this week. The Hawks confiscated cocaine valued at more than R700 million hidden in containers on a ship. Beukman says this operation shows the successes that could be achieved by cooperation between different agencies. “Cooperation with police agencies of other jurisdictions is key and the committee is in favour of strengthening the cooperation with other law enforcement agencies to deal with crime syndicates. The committee is convinced the DPCI (Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation) have demonstrated commitment to deal with organised crime.” Meanwhile, the Cape Town Metro Police have arrested a 19-year-old male in Pelican Park for being in possession of drugs and stolen property. The Metro Police Spokesperson Ruth Solomons says officers were acting on a tip-off and apprehended the suspect. He was found in possession of dagga, Tik and stolen copper cables. The man was taken to Grassy Park Police Station where he was charged. Solomons says the suspect will appear in court soon. “Officers followed up on information regarding a possible delivery of stolen items and drugs at a residence in Starling Road, Pelican Park and upon arrival saw a man coming out of the premises with a backpack. They found one half Mandrax tablet and approximately 10 meters of copper electrical cable in his backpack. He could not account for the copper. Upon searching the premises officers found two bags of dagga and 21 Tik packets buried in the backyard.”
