The Online School Registration Application in Gauteng has been criticised by parents who went to register their children in the Pretoria district’s offices and the Hebron district. The parents say they are frustrated with the online registration process which has left their children without a school. Over 7 000 learners are yet to be placed in schools around Gauteng since school re-opened for the 2019 calendar year. A parent says he is frustrated with the online registration process and has called on the government to improve it. He says: “Since re-opening of schools, we have been here up and down with no clearer solution. So what we are saying to the government is that the system has failed. Panyaza Lesufi you have failed, ANC you have failed, you’ve done your part before but now you are playing gimmicks.”
