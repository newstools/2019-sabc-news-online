The Drakenstein Municipality in Paarl in the Western Cape has started to distribute housing starter kits to victims of Tuesday’s fire in Mbekweni. The municipality says it is working hard to resettle 500 people, affected by the informal settlement fire, by the end of Sunday. Spokesperson Riana Geldenhuys says initial estimates were that approximately 250 people and over 70 informal structures were affected, but it has now been confirmed that the fire left nearly 500 people destitute and damaged 100 informal structures. The cause of the fire in the OR section of Mbekweni is still being investigated. Geldenhuys says the Municipality is working closely with government and private organisations to ensure that the affected families are resettled in the same area by the end of this weekend. Most of these residents were staying with friends or relatives in the area.
