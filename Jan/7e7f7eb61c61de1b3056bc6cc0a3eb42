Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga says rail infrastructure in the Pretoria North corridor has been problematic for a while now. He visited the Mountain View Train Station in Pretoria west where two trains traveling from Mabopane Station to Pretoria collided. One was stationery on the platform when another hit it. Three people have been killed. The number of injured people is estimated at over 300, with over 80 reported to have suffered serious injuries. The injured have been taken to various hospitals in the capital. Msimanga says something should urgently be done to end the loss of life on trains. “If you look between Pretoria North and the Paul Kruger Station, there’s always been a number of accidents and I think this is something that needs serious attention. But I don’t want to speculate this morning about what happened because it’s something… (those) that are on the scene that are combing to see what could’ve been the cause of the accident, and the we can make a comment from here. But I think there’s a need now immediately to have a meeting with Prasa to say we cannot lose anymore more lives. There needs to be some kind of an upgrade in terms of the signalling and also the trains that are here.”
