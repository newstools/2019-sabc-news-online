The Transport Education Training Authority (TETA) has urged people to remain vigilant on the roads as wet weather conditions are expected to continue throughout the week. This as hundreds of people is making their way home from the festive season holidays.  Severe thunderstorms are expected to continue across most parts of the country, and emergency services personnel are on high alert due to the possibility of flooding. TETA’s Chief Financial Officer, Simon Ndukwana, has appealed to people to obey the rules of the road. “Accidents are caused by human error. We are reminding you about simple things like fatigue. When you are driving long distance you need to take a lot of juices. Please don’t text and drive. It’s so shocking when you see someone driving at 120kms/hour and they are texting and driving. Please be safe out there. Sort out your behaviours. This is the festive season, yes be glad and have fun, but there are options out there. You can call an Uber or other cabs instead of you getting behind the wheel.” Click on video below:
