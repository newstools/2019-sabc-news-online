The African National Congress says it expects all its members and those attending Saturday’s manifesto launch in Durban, to behave themselves. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule briefed the media in Durban on the party’s readiness to launch its election manifesto and celebrate its 107th anniversary at the Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday. He says “The Peoples’ Manifesto” will focus on re-igniting the country’s economy. Magashule has reiterated that it’s important for all those who will be at the stadium to conduct themselves with respect. “You don’t go there to cause any problems. Our members are expected to be disciplined because the role of 2018 was about renewal, discipline, selflessness and unity. Everyone is expected, if you go to church and you are drunk you won’t enter so we won’t allow alcohol, divisive t-shirts.” Several roads around the stadium will be closed from six o’clock tonight to the early hours of Sunday morning. Meanwhile, ANC Women’s League President Bathabile Dlamini is currently leading a women’s march in the Durban city centre. The aim of the march is to highlight the plight of victims of gender-based violence. During the march, issues that ordinary women are facing will be raised. They include the killing of young women by their partners. Later, Dlamini will address the gathering, after which women will hold a night vigil ahead of the party’s big event at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium.
