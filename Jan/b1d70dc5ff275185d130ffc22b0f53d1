South Africa remains among the world’s most corrupt countries. This is after the country ranked 73rd in the 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index released by Transparency International on Monday. The Index uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. South Africa had a score of 43 and was placed 9th in Sub-Saharan Africa which is ranked as the the worst performing region in the world. The most un-corrupt countries are Denmark and New Zealand and the most corrupt Somalia, Syria and South Sudan. Corruption Watch is calling on South Africa to strengthen measures against corruption and to ensure that there is strong prosecution for the corrupt. Executive Director David Lewis says not much has changed from the previous statistics. “Our score places us in that category of countries very known for corruption and it’s not good news. We’ve gone slightly down. And whether it’s worse or better it’s of a scale that is not good. The next time the survey is taken we better have some serious prosecution.”
