Police Minister Bheki Cele has commended Constable Dwane Kemp, who died in a hail of bullets in Port Elizabeth. Kemp and his partner were shot during an armed robbery, at Central in the CBD. Four of the gunmen were shot and died at the scene, while Kemp died later in hospital. Minister Cele used the opportunity to call on police officers to defend themselves. “We are very proud of the young man that is lying here today (Saturday) because he did not surrender; he did not give up until he himself fell down. It’s a situation where leadership and management of the police will have to try and enhance their skills, enhance their equipment, so that they are able to be there and if there is a last man standing it should be a member, not the criminal.” Kemp’s wife, Candice Kemp has described him as a loving man, who also loved his job. “His job was his second passion. His first passion was me and my daughter, and our son, but his job was his passion. He was also good at what he did.” Click below for more on the story:
