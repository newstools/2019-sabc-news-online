The Eastern Cape Co-operative Governance Department has welcomed the sentencing of a bogus traditional surgeon in the East London Magistrate’s Court. 34-year-old Lelethu Zilibele has been handed either an R8000 fine or two years imprisonment. This after he was found guilty of circumcising a 15-year-old boy, who was later rescued. Zilibele was also sentenced to three years in jail, which is suspended for five years. Cogta MEC Fikile Xasa says he hopes that this case will encourage other families to lay charges against illegal traditional surgeons. “It will take bold steps for families of this nature to arrest such people, because obviously they can’t give evidence. It must be those who are affected directly who must stand up and give evidence. They must be bold because they will have pressure from society.” Click on video below:
