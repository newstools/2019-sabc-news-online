As majority in fact,” added another member. Amcu has issued an ultimatum to the employer. “We want to show the CEO that we are Amcu, and we’ll always be Amcu. If he does not cooperate with the organisation, he will see what he wants to see. By the way, this is an alarm to him, because we are also going for negotiations in the platinum belt around April or May. So, we are alarming him to say we are still Amcu that he knows. We are still ready. We are still in power, and we are still active,” says Amcu’s Totwana Mandisi. Amcu members at Sibanye Stillwater have been on strike for nine weeks now. The mine says it has contingency plans in place to minimize financial losses in the platinum sector.
