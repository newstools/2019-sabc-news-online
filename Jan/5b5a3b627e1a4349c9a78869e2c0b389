Former Bosasa CFO Andries van Tonder has ended his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Earlier he told the commission that he was awarded a R20 000 cash “bonus” every month to stop him from talking about the dodgy dealings between the facility and management company and government. Van Tonder said the money started coming in from 2005 where he was paid an additional R5 000 a month which was subsequently increased to R20 000 a month in 2013. He also told the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that staff who were involved in the processing of cash for bribes also received money. “I recall mainly, mainly from Gavin Watson himself if he was around. But if he’s not around or present at the office at the time, I recall his daughter Lindzy Watson would give me the cash….WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU… Yes.” Van Tonder’s testimony below:
