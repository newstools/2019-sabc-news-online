The standoff between Sibanye Stillwater and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) appears nowhere near to being resolved. Amcu have demanded an annual wage increase of R1000 over the next three years. Sibanye Stillwater had applied for an interdict to stop the secondary strike on Friday. Amcu claims that they did extend their hand to engage with Sibanye but however Sibanye became adamant that they had concluded their agreement with these other union. Therefore they could not engage with Amcu. “What we as Amcu are doing is mandated by our members, it’s quite the right thing. You’ll remember that Gold sector is the one that really doesn’t pay workers. These workers they still go four kilometres underground earning R7800 per month,” explains Joseph Mathunjwa who is the president of Amcu.
