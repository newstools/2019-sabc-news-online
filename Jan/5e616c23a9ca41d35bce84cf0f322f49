African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) chairperson in KwaZulu Natal Kwazi Mshengu has disputed allegations that President Cyril Ramaphosa could be booed during his delivery of the party’s election manifesto. Mshengu affirms that those hoping that Ramaphosa will be booed are the opposition. The ANCYL leader suggested that the narrative that Ramaphosa is not welcome in KwaZulu-Natal is false. Mshengu says he is confident that any elements that plan to disrupt today’s rally will not come from within the ranks of the ANC. “The enemy of the revolution which is actually represented by the opposition at this stage is hoping that we are going to boo President Ramaphosa, so that it is able to continue with the wrong narrative that Ramaphosa is not welcomed in KwaZulu Natal. And my point was clear – that the president must relax, there is no one who is going to boo him… actually we are going to disappoint the enemy of revolution.” Ramaphosa is due to deliver what is being dubbed ‘The People’s Manifesto’ on Saturday at the Moses Mabhida stadium. The event, which was initially intended to start at 09:00 has been delayed due to bad weather.
