The African National Congress (ANC)  says its January 8th Statement will not be affected by the removal of its Chaplain-General and member of the Methodist Church, Reverend Vukile Mehana,  from the programme. The governing party says he would no longer officiate at the event due to be held in Durban next week. This comes after the derogatory remarks that Mehana allegedly made relating to women church ministers. See apology by Reverend Mehana on Twitter: ANC spokesperson in the Presidency Zizi Kodwa says the party’s Top Six will soon meet to discuss the way forward with regards to Mehana. “That position is not an elected position but secondly as we meet the day after tomorrow, we have to take a decision as the ANC in terms of the national chaplaincy of the ANC in the light of the utterances attributed to reverend Mehana. The issue of the chaplaincy will be finalised between the leadership of the ANC, particularly the Top Six will have that and finalise. But of course we got provincial chaplaincy, we still have a chaplaincy in KZN, so there will be no difficulty over whom then presides and officiates an ANC event.” Click on videos below:
