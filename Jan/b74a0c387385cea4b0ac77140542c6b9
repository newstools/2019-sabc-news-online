Residents of Bishop Lavis on the Cape Flats are planning to picket outside the local Bergville Primary School on the first day of school on Wednesday. They are unhappy with what they call a disproportional learner to teacher ratio which they say leads to high levels of school dropouts. Community spokesperson Victor Altensteadt says some classrooms currently have one teacher to 70 learners. He says the school also has other issues which need to be urgently addressed. “There is also the issue of school security. Our learners are traumatised. There is gang violence happening within our communities, there is also no school security then there is also no assistance that the Western Cape Education Department provides to the schools in terms of learner support,” says Altensteadt.
