The Electoral Commission of South Africa has launched its Elections 2019 campaign which aims to target young people to encourage them to register to vote. Chairperson Glen Mashinini launched the campaign in Midrand, Johannesburg. He says people under the age of 30 are under-represented in the electoral process. Mashinini, has however, commended South Africa’s electoral process and the maturity of the country’s democracy. Mashinini says, “South Africa remains on track, firmly committed to what it set out to do in 1994 that is the democratic project and the democratic journey here today. We see the people of this country will once again go to the polls to elect representatives for national and provincial legislature reaffirming their commitment to nothing else but our democratic journey.” The Electoral Commission also says the country is still on track for democracy. The organisation’s Chairperson Glen Mashinini says although there have been challenges, institutions in South Africa are strong and there is still a general commitment to democracy. He adds, “South Africa remains on track, firmly committed to what it set out to do in 1994 that is the democratic project and the democratic journey here today. We see the people of this country will once again go to the polls to elect representatives for national and provincial legislature reaffirming their commitment to nothing else but our democratic journey.”
