The Department of Basic Education has appealed for people to refrain from burning schools this year. Last year, dozens of schools were gutted in service delivery protests across the country, as disgruntled community members attempted to make their pleas known to government officials. The Education Department’s Spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, says schools are well prepared this year to receive learners who have been allocated spaces in schools… “We are hoping that members of the community around the country will not be burning our schools in 2019 because that comes at a huge cost and it will affect their own children. The preparation for the learners and effective learning and teaching has already been put in place. So today is just a matter of receiving those learners who were already enrolled and to deal with late admissions.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/642101">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
