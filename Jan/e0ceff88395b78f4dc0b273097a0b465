Heavy traffic volumes are being experienced on major highways as people head home following the festive season holidays. Authorities say close to 1500 vehicles per hour are being recorded at a number of toll plazas on the N3 North as holidaymakers leave the KwaZulu-Natal coast. The Pulumani Toll Plaza on the N1 South, outside Pretoria, as well as the Carousel Plaza is experiencing similar heavy volumes. Many people are travelling home on the highway from northern parts of the country. Drivers are urged to rest regularly and to observe the speed limits as well as maintain safe following distances. Meanwhile, the flow of traffic between Polokwane and the Kranskop Toll Gate in Limpopo has steadily increased after midday. This as thousands of holidaymakers return to economic hubs like Gauteng. The N3 Toll Route Concession says it has been experiencing an increase in traffic volumes. The Concession’s Praveen Sunderlall says they have been recording an average of 1700 vehicles per hour passing the Mooi River plaza. “We quite excited that people have been driving responsibly. We had low incidents so it’s a good indication that people have listened to what we had to say. In terms of planning the trip and making sure that they reach back home in one piece with their family as well.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
