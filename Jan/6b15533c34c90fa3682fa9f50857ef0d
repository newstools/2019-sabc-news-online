The Eastern Cape Department of Education is confident that the matric results for 2018 will be notably better than the 65% pass rate the province recorded in 2017. The province, which has been the worst performer for seven consecutive years, believes its turnaround strategy will yield positive results. The department is aiming for a 70% pass rate. The provincial Education spokesperson, Malibongwe Mtima, says their turnaround strategy includes programmes to capacitate both learners and teachers. “We started telematics, revisions, camps and robed in staff holders to assist as well as volunteers in some schools We are hopeful that they will reach the 70 % target if not fail with a very small number,” says Mtima.
