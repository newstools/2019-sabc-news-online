The Mokgoro Enquiry   probing the fitness to hold office of suspended National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa (NPA) Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi will continue in Centurion, Pretoria on Tuesday morning. During the commission on Monday Jiba’s lawyers dismissed allegations of accepting bribes against their client. This comes after reports that a witness at the Enquiry into State Capture would implicate her as one of the people who accepted bribes amounting to thousands of rands from the controversial facility and management company, Bosasa. The enquiry was established by the Presidency in terms of Section 12(6) of the NPA Act 32 of 1998. Like in any proceedings in a commission like this, witnesses have to take an oath before giving evidence. Retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro will preside over the enquiry into Jiba and Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office and submit the final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa by March 9, 2019.
