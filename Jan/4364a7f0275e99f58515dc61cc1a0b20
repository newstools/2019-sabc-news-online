The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has suggested it will take action based on testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The SIU says it has set up a Governance Committee to look at the testimony and consider if further SIU investigations are required. The Unit has come under the spotlight at the State Capture Inquiry during the nine-day testimony of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. The Commission produced the 2009 SIU report which found that there was wrong-doing on the part of Correctional Services’ tenders awarded to Bosasa. The Governance Committee will be chaired by the SIU Chief Governance Officer, Advocate Mahlodi Muofhe. “We’ve investigated this thing in the past. There is this Commission now and what is happening there is of interest to us as a crime busting institution. We certainly have to have an interest, and so out of what is happening there, when we evaluate what is happening in so far as our mandate is concerned, we find that there is a need for us to look at reinvestigating some of the contracts. In any case, Bosasa is still doing some work at DCS, we may have to bring up an application to set aside these contracts,” says Muofhe.
