The suspension of a teacher at Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke in the North West has been lifted. Elana Barkhuizen was suspended last Thursday after taking a photo of white Grade R learners seated separately from their black classmates. Education MEC Sello Lehari is heading a team of officials to a meeting with school management. The meeting comes after trade union Solidarity announced its intention to legally challenge the suspension of Elana Barkhuizen. Lehari will brief the media after the meeting.
