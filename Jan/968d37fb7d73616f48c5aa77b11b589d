The African National Congress (ANC) has committed to making a concerted effort to include women, rural people and the youth in the growth of the country’s economy. The party’s manifesto, delivered by ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa in Durban, says it will build an economy in which all South Africans can have a stake they can benefit from. Ramaphosa said, “We will draw more women, more rural people and more youth into the economy through programmes that extend ownership to workers, through expanding access to digital skills training to young people, by developing and supporting technological and digital start-ups, and more concerted focus on SMMEs, cooperatives and township and village enterprises.” Ramaphosa’s address clearly reflected a focus on ” people”  and ” work” as illustrated in the Word cloud below:  Words most prevalent in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s speech.  The event which is a celebration of the party’s 107th anniversary and the launch of the party’s manifesto was attended by former President Jacob Zuma, Alliance partners, fraternal organisations from the African continent as well as thousands of ANC supporters. “We will deliberately and consciously use government’s massive procurement spend to further our economic transformation objectives and support job creation and localised re-industrialisation,” said Ramaphosa. He said, “To further support township and village enterprises, the ANC government will step up the enforcement of measures to prevent illegal trading and selling of counterfeit and unsafe products.”   Read the ANC’s election manifesto below: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5683707-ANC-Manifesto-Booklet-A5-Digital.js", {
