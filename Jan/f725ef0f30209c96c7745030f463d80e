The Congress of the People (COPE) has urged South African Police Services (SAPS) to arrest those who are involved in the murder of Mangaung Metro employee Seipati Lechoano. Lechoano’s body was found inside the boot of her vehicle following her disappearance days earlier. She was an anti-fraud and corruption officer at the municipality. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday at the Kagisanong Hall in Rocklands, Bloemfontein.  Dennis Bloem COPE’s spokesperson says: “The death of Seipati Lechaono must not be another statistic of unknown murder in the country. We want police to arrest murderers who murder people and walk the street. We are serious to say that people must be arrested for this murder,” says Bloem.
