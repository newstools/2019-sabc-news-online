Four suspects, who allegedly sold Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) jobs to more than 100 students from different provinces, are expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrate’s Court, east of Johannesburg on Monday. They were arrested on Friday in a sting operation by the Johannesburg Metro Police. It’s understood that students paid for the JMPD jobs. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says the four face charges of fraud and impersonating a metro police officer. The victims, who are from Limpopo, KZN and Tembisa, paid sums of between R5 000, R8 000 and R12 000. Minnaar says: “Members of the public are warned not to fall victim to crime syndicates because a Metro Police post can never be bought.”
