The applications of more than 300 000 mainly first-year students have been approved by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The scheme has also confirmed that they have reversed their rejection of 60 000 students and have now granted them funding. The scheme’s Spokesperson Kagiso Mamabolo says the scheme has tried to fast track processes in 2019 to ensure the smooth registration of funded students. “2019 has started with 90% success compared to 2018. This is evident by the fact that by today NSFAS had successfully communicated the outcome results to 95% of students who applied, whereas last year this time NSFAS had not communicated outcome of results.”
