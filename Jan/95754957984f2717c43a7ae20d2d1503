Esidimeni Family committee, Christine Nxumalo, says they are angry and disappointed by Democratic Alliance’s (DA) stunt to scrutinise its tragedy for political gain. She says the billboard shows no empathy towards the families of the victims. “We are offended by this and the DA used our pain for political gain. It’s about what they want and they have no right to put those names in their election post.” This was after a billboard was put up outside the Johannesburg CBD with the words “The ANC is killing us” listing the names of all the victims of Marikana, Life Esidimeni and the children that have drowned in pit latrines. However, the DA defended its election campaign billboard, saying the names that appear on the posters were already on the public domain. CLICK VIDEO BELOW:
