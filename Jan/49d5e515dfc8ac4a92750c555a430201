The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) has rejected claims made by former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer (COO) Angelo Agrizzi that a General Secretary of the union, known as “Sbu”, was promised R1 million for his part in dodgy deals. In his testimony, Mr Agrizzi at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture stated that there was a meeting held in 2007, which included the presence of a person by the name ‘Sbu’, who is allegedly said to have been the General Secretary of the union Popcru at that time. Popcru Spokesperson Richard Mamabolo says there was a meeting, but Popcru never mandated anyone to the actual meeting. “We are saying the Police and Prison Civil Rights Union never mandated anyone to any meeting and as far as we are concerned. Popcru never had any formal or informal meeting with Bosasa,” says Mamabolo. Listen to interview below for more: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/647156">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
