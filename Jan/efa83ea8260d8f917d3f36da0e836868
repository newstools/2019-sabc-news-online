Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that the ANC in the North West had requested money for electioneering purposes. In his testimony to the Commission, underway in Parktown in Johannesburg, Agrizzi says the money was requested five years ago, and that it had to be laundered through youth centres in the North West. Agrizzi told Chairperson of the Commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, that a government social services department would pay Bosasa for non-existent software programmes at youth development centres. “What was requested, I can confirm it that it was Syvion Dlamini from Bosasa, that requested that I attend a meeting at a stadium in the North West and the MEC was present. At that meeting, I was told it was for electioneering. I cannot recall the lady MEC’s name, but what I can tell you is that Syvion Dlamini was present and he will recall the person’s name because he ultimately handled the delivery.” Deputy Chief Justice Zondo then asked if Mr Dlamini was from the Youth Centre of Bosasa, to which Agrizzi responded, “I believe he is the Director of Bosasa Youth Development Centre.” Agrizzi says the transaction that took place in the North West was around R3.4 and the amount paid to one of the individuals was R1.8 million. Below is a brief Question and Answer conversation between Judge Zondo and Agrizzi. Zondi: Do you know whether Mr Dlamini and the MEC you referred to had connections with any particular political party? Agrizzi: Yes I do. Zondo: And what is the political party? Agrizzi: My answer to your question is the ruling party. Zondo: The election, as you understood, the purpose of this money, was it to help somebody or a political party or election campaign? Was that your understanding? Agrizzi: That was my understanding.
