With just five days left before the 2019 academic year begins, dozens of schools that were hit by strong winds have not been fixed in the Eastern Cape. Buildings, windows and roofs were blown away in 26 schools last month. Parents and learners from Esidwadweni Primary school, near Mthatha, are worried as not much has been done to fix the damaged structures. School Governing Body vice chairperson, Mazwi Saba-Saba says they have been in contact with the Education Department but no action has been taken. “As the schools are about to open, not much has been done when you look at the school, it is severely damaged. If the Department of Education could borrow temporary structures while this building is being fixed, children need to start school. I did receive a report from the school principal telling me something will be done but my only worry is when that is all going to happen because school opens Monday.” Meanwhile, Education spokesperson, Malibongwe Mtima, says community halls will be used to accommodate learners while they seek more permanent solutions. “The majority of these schools it’s one block, or two of the three. What we have opted to do as the department is to ensure that the dining hall and community halls around the community are utilised to ensure that our learners in the first day of school are at school and are taught.”
