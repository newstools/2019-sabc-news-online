An extended African National Congress (ANC) NEC, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, will on Friday hold its national list conference in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. The list conference will consolidate the party’s list of candidates for the National Assembly and also receive reports from party provincial structures on their lists for provincial legislatures. ANC alliance partners and leagues will also be attending, but questions remain about the beleaguered North West, where the ANC has been unable to hold its provincial list conference. “It will be proof read, is Mbalula fit and proper to be on the list to go to Parliament given the fact that he is accused of this and that, so it is not a given that you are on the list and if the result of that process come out and say you are not fit you will still be on the list. Individuals will be checked and vetted and at the end of the day the ANC will look at the list and a political decisions will be taken. It is not cast in stone, it is not a given,” explains ANC’s Head of Elections Fikile Mbalula.
