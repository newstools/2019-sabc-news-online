A national election is the worst thing Britain could do now and would mean delaying Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday before a no confidence vote in parliament. May said she was confident the government would win the vote, which was called by opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after May’s proposed Brexit deal was rejected by a large majority on Tuesday. “I believe (an election) is the worst thing we could do, it would deepen division when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty and it would bring delay when we need to move forward,” May told parliament. There is a long way to go to bring Britain back together after the divisive 2016 Brexit referendum, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday, calling on lawmakers to back her government in a confidence vote so she could finish the job. “We are living through an historic moment in our nation’s history following the referendum that divided our nation in half. We dearly need to bring our country back together, and last night’s vote showed that we do have a long way to go,” May told parliament, a day after her Brexit deal was rejected by a large majority. “But, I don’t believe a general election is that path to do that, and I don’t believe that a government led by (opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn) is the path to do that either.”
