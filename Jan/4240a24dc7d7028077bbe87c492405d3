Families of the mentally-ill patients, who died during the Life Esidimeni relocation, say they don’t want an apology from the Democratic Alliance (DA) over its controversial election billboard. The billboard, that was erected outside the Johannesburg CBD last week, raised the ire of the families who considered it inappropriate. The billboard with the words “The ANC is killing us” lists the names of all the victims of Marikana, Life Esidimeni and the children that have drowned in pit latrines.   Nxumalo says they are still looking into the possibility of filing a lawsuit regardless of whether the party removes the billboard or not. “The families have said that they don’t want an apology from DA but instead of an apology they requesting that the DA remove. They also requested that we look into the IEC and see if we can’t report the DA to the IEC because we feel that the campaign that they used is inappropriate.”
