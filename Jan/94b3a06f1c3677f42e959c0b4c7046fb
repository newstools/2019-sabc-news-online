Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha says he has directed two experts to jointly assess murder convict Janusz Walus. Masutha once again denied Walus’s bid to be placed on parole, citing conflicting experts reports submitted to the department. In 2018, the High Court in Pretoria returned the matter back to Masutha ordering that he decide whether to place Walus on parole or not. Masutha had until this coming Friday to decide. Masutha had said Walus had to personally apologise to the Hani family and a security assessment done on whether or not he still posed a security threat to the country. Masutha says he’s expecting a new report in six months. The SACP has welcomed Masutha’s decision to deny Hani’s killer parole. Waluz is currently serving a life sentence at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre in Pretoria. In his application, he is quoted as saying he regrets killing Chris Hani; the father and husband, but does not regret killing Chris Hani the Communist. Minister Masutha denied him parole saying he has not shown any remorse. SACP Spokesperson Alex Mashilo says they will continue to fight for Walusz to be in jail for the rest of his life. – Additional reporting by Ntebo Mokobo.
