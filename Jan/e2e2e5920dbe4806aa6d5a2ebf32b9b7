The Commission of Inquiry hearing into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) resumes on Tuesday with more employees expected testify. On Monday, Head of Naledi Advisory Services Frans Lekubo said he discovered that a senior manager of IT security at PIC had opened a corruption case against its former CEO Daniel Matjila with the South African police service (SAPS). Naledi Advisory Services were appointed by the PIC to conduct an investigation into the leaking of confidential information and circulation of a malicious report against PIC CEO and the CFO, but instead found other things. This week more evidence is expected at the commission as more witnesses shed light on problems of corporate governance, financial mismanagement and dubious investments. On Monday, Lekubo says he was contacted by Matjila to conduct investigations into the leaking of confidential information and the circulation of malicious reports. Lekubo established that head of PIC IT security Simphiwe Mayisela had opened a corruption case against the former PIC CEO. A preliminary report for the PIC commission is expected to be finalised next month and the final report will be handed to President Cyril Ramaphosa in April.
