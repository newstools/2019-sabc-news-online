A couple accused of breaking into vehicles in Cape Town is set to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning. Police Spokesperson FC van Wyk says police members who responded to a License Plate Recognition User Group alert caught a woman and a man sitting in the vehicle at Rhodes Memorial Zoo near the University of Cape Town. Van Wyk says it’s currently a hotspot for vehicle theft. He says vehicle breaking implements were found inside the car as well as items positively linked to a Claremont case of theft out of motor vehicle. The suspects are facing charges of possession of presumed stolen property and possession of vehicle breaking implements.
