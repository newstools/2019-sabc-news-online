Basic Education Minster Angie Motshekga will officially announce the 2018 matric exams results in Johannesburg this evening. This announcement will be broadcast on the SABC News Channel 404 and it will also be streamed live on the SABC News YouTube channel and website, as well as the Department of Basic Education’s website. The exams were concluded in November last year. Close to 800 000 full-time and part-time students sat for the exams. Learners from across the country cannot contain their excitement as they patiently wait for the matric results to be announced. Some of the top achievers in Gauteng have gathered in Midrand north of Johannesburg where they are waiting in anticipation. “I’m Rowan Crawford and I’m a matriculant from Princehof School for the visually impaired in Pretoria. My intentions are to do BA languages with English as a major, German, Latin and History. I expect that I will do well enough. I just said to myself you should do as well as you should,” says one of the matriculants. The learners have been accompanied by their parents and next of kin. One of the parents had this to say, “I’m a very proud mother standing here now. To be invited to this event I knew that we could expect good results. And I trust that everything went well.” More students say they cannot wait to start new lives and to further their studies at institutions of higher learning. “My name is Nosa Sibisi, I’m from Titeloi Socondary School in Soweto, I hope that I have been accepted at Wits because I have applied for Architectural Design. Most of the time, I would force myself to study at 3am. I would also use motivational videos to motivate myself,” adds another excited student. Click on videos below:
