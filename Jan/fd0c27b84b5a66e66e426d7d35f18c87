Police believe the two men arrested for two gang-related murders in Westbury on Friday could be linked to other crimes and killings in the area. The two men, aged 23 and 26, have been arrested for two counts of murder, for their alleged involvement in a shooting that left one person dead at a funeral in June last year. The police’s Kay Makhubela says the men have also been charged with a second murder after one person died in hospital following a shooting in the area on the 15th of December. “Police followed the leads up until Friday when they got their whereabouts in Westbury. So they will be appearing in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s court facing charges of murder. The police management applaud the police who work tirelessly to chase and to arrest the suspects. We are going to continue and make sure that the community of Westbury are living in peace.” Click on video below:
