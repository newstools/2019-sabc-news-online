The commission of inquiry into state capture continues in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday morning. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi takes the stand to conclude his testimony. On Monday, he revealed how his relationship with Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson began to fall apart when he was asked to take the fall for corruption at the company. This was in regards to a probe by the SIU, where an investigation was underway into contracts obtained by Bosasa through the correctional services department. Agrizzi says this was an awakening moment, of what was to come next. He is back on Tuesday morning for what is expected to be his final day of testifying.
