N3 Toll Concession Commercial Manager Con Roux has asked road users to exercise caution when travelling on Van Reenen’s Pass in the Uthukela District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. This is due to road rehabilitation work that commenced this month. Roux says the safety of the road workers should be prioritised by the drivers at all times, throughout the duration of the road works. “For the next 20 months or so, there would be construction work taking place on Van Reenen pass. We are asking motorists to please exercise caution in that area and to pay particular regard to the safety of construction workers but also there would be one lane at least available on each direction. So no stop and go or something of that nature but to the motorists please be aware of those construction works and to ensure that speed is reduced in order to protect the safety of the construction workers.”
