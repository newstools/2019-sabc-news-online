International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has denied suggestions that a diplomatic row is brewing  between South Africa and Mozambique. This follows the arrest of Mozambique’s former Finance Minister Manuel Chang in South Africa at the end of 2018. On Wednesday, Chang was back in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court which ruled that his detention was legal. Chang was arrested at the OR Tambo International Airport over alleged secret loans totalling R2 billion to Mozambican state companies. United States authorities accuse Chang of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering. He has denied any wrongdoing. The SABC has learnt that President Cyril Ramaphosa will travel to Mozambique on Monday to discuss the issue with his counterpart Filipe Nyusi. However, Sisulu says the issue is not on the agenda of the two leaders. “The President is free to go and see his counterparts anytime.  It has nothing to do with the Hanekom and the minister of finance whatsoever.” “Interpol and ourselves have a binding protocol where they can make a request for us to stop a passenger passing through our ports and give reason for it.” “If we are satisfied with that reason, we act on it. And this is what we did with the former minister of Mozambique. Our ambassador in Mozambique went to investigate and was able to interact with Hanekom.” Related video click below:
