Free State Education MEC Tate Makgoe believes that not giving adequate support to progressed learners is the reason the province did not to achieve the number one spot in the 2018 matric results. Progressed learners are those who’ve failed Grade 11 twice and then are progressed through to Grade 12. The Free State has been topping other provinces for the past two years. Makgoe says the province will now go to the drawing board and give support to progressed learners. “We know where we think the mistake was and I think it was in terms of supporting our progressed learners. We thought the system has matured and that schools can actually take the responsibility of progressed learners whereas in the past we had a special programme that was run by the MEC and the head office to support progressed learners but we are happy with our performance. If you look at the results without the progress learners, we are still a top province.” Fezile Dabi, in the North Eastern Free State, is the district with the best results in South Africa for a second year in succession. Fezile Dabi, which includes the towns of Parys, Sasolburg, Villiers and Kroonstad, has a pass rate of 92.3%. District director, Dr Vusi Chuta, says good results come from planning and dedication. “It’s a five year plan. Most important, you build a team that will rally around the idea. Build systems as far back as 2012. Every year, every learner and teacher is motivated to win.” Click on videos below:
