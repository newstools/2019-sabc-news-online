Former NPA Senior Prosecutor and now Democratic Alliance (DA) MP, Glynnis Breytenbach, says Lawrence Mrwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba should not have been appointed to senior positions in the NPA. Breytenbach says Mrwebi should have not been appointed Head the Commercial Crimes Unit. This after he was accused by National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) senior advocate Jan Ferreira of defeating the ends of justice after deleting some crucial state information from his official computer, amongst other reasons. Breytenbach believes that Nomgcobo Jiba shouldn’t have been appointed Deputy Head of the NPA because she does not have the requisite experience. “There were people in the NPA, many people who were ranked superior, who were equally if not better suited for the job. There was no reason why anyone of them shouldn’t have been promoted into that position. She was promoted skipping ranks to that position,” says Breytenbach.
