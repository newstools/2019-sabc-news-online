West Rand police will have a zero tolerance police for shebeen owners trading in liquor without the appropriate licenses. This according to the police’s Carmen Hendricks, who says two suspects have been arrested in two separate incidents in as many days and nearly 100 litres of alcohol was confiscated from one property where it was being sold illegally. “Upon their arrival at two different addresses at OR Tambo and Siyahlala squatter camps, they found liquor at the premises and not one of the owners, one female and one male, had liquor licenses to produce. Different alcohol was confiscated and taken to Randfontein police station and handed in to the SAP 13 storeroom. No one will be tolerated if found selling liquor without a license. Liquor abuse is a choice. It affects everyone.”
