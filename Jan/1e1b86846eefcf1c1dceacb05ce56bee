Most of Lesotho borders have been kept busy with a large number of migrants and students entering South Africa. They have used mainly Peka, Caledonspoort, Maputsoe, Van Rooy and Maseru Port of Entries. There were long queues from Sunday morning. “We wish taxi operators will be patient with us for instance I’m going to Bloemfontein for the first time they need to help me I don’t know the place,” says one motorist. “The queues are fine officials are helping us. The line is moving fast. We want to have a safe journey the queue is long but quick,” adds another motorist. Police remain on high alert. “We have reinforced our members with new recruits in our border to maintain law and order. Our operators are continuing even after festive season, says Free State SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thandi Mbambo. Meanwhile, border authorities say the process at border posts is going smoothly despite the large numbers of travelers. WATCH BELOW:
