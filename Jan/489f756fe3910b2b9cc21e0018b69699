Analysts are anticipating weak economic data in the fourth quarter 2018. This as Statistics South Africa prepares to release the mining, manufacturing, and retail sales figures over the of course of the next two weeks. Manufacturing output is expected to decline to two per cent in November, compared to three per cent in October 2018. This is despite a weaker exchange rate in the course of last year which may have rendered domestic exports more competitive. Economist Laura Campbell explains: “It’s like that growth will have been dampened by the fact that domestic demand for manufactured goods remains weak, as too does global demands for manufactured goods.  There have also been signs emerging towards a slackening off in global economic growth and that’s been in part to fears of an escalation of a trade war emerging between the world’s leading economies.”
