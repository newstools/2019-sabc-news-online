The legendary musician and producer, Dan Tshanda, is being remembered at a memorial service held at the Baseline in Newtown, Johannesburg. He died of heart failure on Saturday after receiving treatment for a lung infection a few days earlier. Family spokesperson Moudy Mudielwana says Tshanda was not well for the three days leading up to his death, but that his sudden passing comes as a huge shock to his wife, children, family and fans, and to the music industry at large.
