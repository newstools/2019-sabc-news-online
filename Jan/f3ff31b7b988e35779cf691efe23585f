Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi has revealed that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials, Nomgcobo Jiba, Lawrence Mrwebi and Jackie Lephinka, were paid monthly bribes by Bosasa to assist them with any cases levelled against the company. Agrizzi is continuing with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture underway in Parktown, Johannesburg. He has told the Commission of how officials were given certain amounts based on the amount of information they were able to help them with. Agrizzi says the monthly bribes started being paid to officials from 2010. He says NPA officials were given nicknames such as ‘Snake, Snail and J’. “The names, Chair, were Jackie Lephinka, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi and they were handling the investigation at the NPA. I was told to prepare money by Watson for those three names. They had a private discussion about it. I was just told afterwards that this is what needs to get paid. Snake would get R100 000 per month. J would get R20 000 per month and Snail would get R10 000 per month,” says Agrizzi. Agrizzi says information relating to the investigations was also obtained with the assistance of former Correctional Services Commissioner, Linda Mti. Jiba and Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office is currently being probed by the Mokgoro Enquiry sitting in Pretoria. Watch video below for more on the story:
