The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it will campaign for the African National Congress (ANC) in the build-up to the national and provincial elections this year. General Secretary Blade Nzimande says the party will support an ANC which pays attention to those who continue to live below the poverty line. He was addressing SACP members in Soweto during the 24th annual commemoration of the death of its former national chairperson, Joe Slovo. The organisation gathered at the Avalon cemetery in Soweto, the final resting place of many freedom fighters. The SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande says that they take pride in the role played by Slovo. “Twenty four years ago comrade Joe Slovo passed away. 24 years later our organisation is emerging out of its very difficult period since 1994. More of our sections of this leadership almost handed over our country to corrupt elements.” The Young Communist League says there’s a lot to learn from the late Joe Slovo. Fresh from the YCL national elective conference, the newly elected General Secretary Tinyiko Ntini says they are determined to continue the legacy of the late Joe Slovo. “He remains a man that continues to inspire many generations, where Tata Madiba characterised him as he was delivering eulogy during his funeral, as a patriot, a father and a leader, a negotiator and an internationalist, a politician and an organiser.” The SACP says if the ANC does well in its campaigning it won’t stand on its own for the upcoming elections.
