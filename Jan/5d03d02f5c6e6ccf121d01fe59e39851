Schooling is continuing peacefully Monday morning at Laerskool Schweizer Reneke in the North West. Teachers also started reporting for duty a few minutes after 6 am Monday. No incidents have been reported following disruptions last week over allegations of racism at the school. There was outrage over a picture that emerged on social media showing white Grade R learners being separated from their black classmates at the school. The teacher, who is implicated in the matter, has since been suspended pending investigations. Security officers are manning the main entrance to the school. A team from the Education Department is expected to continue with investigations into allegations of racism at the school.
