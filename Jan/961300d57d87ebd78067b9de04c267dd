The University of South Africa (UNISA) student strike that began on the seventh of January has been called off with immediate effect, following talks between university management and the Student Representative Council (SRC). The talks, which ended on Saturday, addressed registration challenges at the university, including enrolment planning, accreditation, provision of laptops and other matters. UNISA says all university activities will resume from  Monday. Spokesperson for UNISA, Martin Ramotshela says the talks have been successful. “We reached agreement with regards to the issues they have raised in their memorandum of demands, but we also importantly reached agreement that based on that, the strike action is called off with immediate effect. As of Monday 14 January all campuses of the university will be open for registration and other services,” says Ramotshela.
