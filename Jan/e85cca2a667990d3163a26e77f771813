All the bodies of the four youngsters who drowned at the Portuguese Island beach in Mozambique have been found. The fourth body of a female was found on Saturday. Family members have expressed satisfaction that all the bodies have been found. Families of the four, aged between 20 and 27-years-old, are still shocked following the drowning of their loved ones. The four were part of a group of eight holiday makers who went to Mozambique to celebrate a friend’s birthday. On Monday they visited Portuguese Island where six of them decided to go for a swim. They were apparently overpowered by strong waves, however one of them managed to escape and called for help. A local diver was able to rescue another one. Three bodies were found on different days. First Secretary for the South African High Commission in Mozambique, Wilhelm van der Vyver says the bodies are in a bad state, “They were washed out; the bodies were washed out by the sea. The bodies are kept in a mortuary here in Maputo. I am told decomposition started.” Representative for the bereaved families, Bongani Diakgo says post-mortems have been conducted on the three bodies that were found earlier. “We are not losing hope, it is painful with their kids they were here to celebrate a birthday and this incident happened. We thank all the people who are keeping us in their prayers and we are hoping to find closure,” says Diakgo. It is expected that the bodies will be deported to South Africa next week.
