The Department of Community Safety in Gauteng says it is working with metro police and other stakeholders in ensuring proper management of high volumes of traffic expected in the province in the next few days. Holidaymakers are returning home, migrant labourers are returning to work and schools are opening in two day’s time and highways heading into Gauteng are still experiencing heavy traffic volumes. Gauteng traffic police Deputy Director Busaphi Nxumalo says all efforts are in place to ensure road safety in the province. Nxumalo says, “We are ready, we’ve got deployments at all our national routes and also our provincial routes. We’ve got our own law enforcement agencies in the province because remember we’re not working alone as department of community safety in Gauteng. We are working with the three metros, we’ve got Tshwane, Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and smaller municipalities because we’ve got eleven municipalities in the province. So,we are working together to make sure that we kill this disease, the fatalities that are taking our people.” Click related video below:
