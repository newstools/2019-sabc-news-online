The Congolese People’s Organisation in South Africa says the opposition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is concerned about suspicions of a deal between former president Joseph Kabila and the provisional winner of the contentious December presidential election Felix Tshisekedi. The organisation fears that chaos could erupt in the DRC – after the country’s electoral commission declared Tshisekedi, the winner. The other main opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu – who was tipped as the favourite in pre-election opinion polls – came second. The DRC has been in the grip of a two-year crisis over the succession of Kabila, who said last year that he would step down after nearly two decades in power. Security has been beefed up across the country amid fears of clashes – after bloody protests marred elections in 2006 and 2011. The community’s spokesperson Jean Bwasa explains, “We will be in a conflict that might lead to chaos because Fayulu will certainly believe that he should take legal recourse and go to the constitutional court, so that might lead us to a possible invalidation of the electoral course as a whole. If not, we could also pre-empt that there is a cloud hanging on these results due to the fact that there was a negotiation between the opposition and the government’s PPRD. But no one knows what deal was signed.” Click on video below:
