The Gauteng police have recovered some of the electronic equipment that was stolen at from the brand new R105 million Menzi Primary School in Ekurhuleni on Tuesday. All 185 learner tablets, teacher laptops and data projectors were stolen. The suspects had tied-up two patrollers and locked them in a room before making off with new equipment which included a Plasma TV and a Digital Video Recorder for cameras. The Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, says police found some of the stolen goods at a shop in the Johannesburg CBD. “We’re still waiting for the police to release a formal statement. We were called to a crime scene moments ago and we established there are some of our properties there. Because it’s still a crime scene, we felt we need to leave it to the police to conclude it and for them to give us a full briefing. We want to thank them for their tireless efforts and the work that they’re doing to ensure that they recover all the stolen properties,” says Lesufi.  Watch a related video below:
