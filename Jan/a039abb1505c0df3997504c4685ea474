A cellphone recording which purports a personal relationship between former President Jacob Zuma and Bosasa Chief Executive Officer Gavin Watson has been heard at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The recording was captured by Bosasa former Chief Operations Officer Angelo Agrizzi. In the clip, Watson was allegedly rehearsing to Agrizzi and former Correctional Services Commissioner Linda Mti, what he plans to tell then President Zuma in their next meeting. This was who Zuma needed to appoint in the National Prosecuting Authority for Bosasa to be protected from prosecution. Agrizzi has also revealed to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture how he obtained a highly confidential document only meant for officials of the National Prosecuting Authority. He says he received the document from Mti. The document listed the names of people and entities who were subject to charges of racketeering.  Meanwhile, Agrizzi has implicated suspended National Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Nomgcobo Jiba and her colleague Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi in his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Jiba and Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office is currently being probed by the Mokgoro Enquiry’s sitting in Pretoria. Agrizzi detailed how Watson paid Jiba, Mrwebi and another NPA official Jackie Lephinka monthly bribes to assist Bosasa with information on the NPA’s investigation into the company and decisions taken. He says information relating to the investigations was also obtained with the assistance of former Correctional Services Commissioner Linda Mti. Evidence leader Paul Pretorius questioned Agrizzi about the claims. Click below for more on the story:
