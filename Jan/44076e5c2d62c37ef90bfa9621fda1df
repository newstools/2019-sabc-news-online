Nine people are on Friday expected to appear at the Howick Magistrate Court for allegedly invading land at Howick in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands on Thursday. Police say the arrest of the suspects sparked a violent protest Thursday night that blockaded the N3 north bound freeway. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says protestors threw stones at passing vehicles but no injuries have been reported. Gwala says: “They blockaded the R617 the Bulwer or Boston Road and the N3 North bound in the Howick area. They blockaded the road with burning tyres and logs. They also threw stones at passing vehicles causing damage to some cars.” A case of public violence was opened at the Howick police station. The protesters also set a truck alight.
