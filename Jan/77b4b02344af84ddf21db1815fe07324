Congress of the People (COPE) President Mosiuoa Lekota has accused President Cyril Ramaphosa of undermining the Constitution of the country. Lekota says President Ramaphosa trampled on the country’s Constitution by facilitating the process towards amending of Section 25 to expropriate land without compensation. Lekota was speaking during his party’s second elective congress in Bloemfontein. Lekota says the country is being led by a President who is leading the attack on the Constitution. He says, “Having taken an oath of office to obey, respect, uphold and maintain the Constitution, our present President came back the following night to say to the country – I will take some of your properties and give it to our people in spite of the declaration of the Constitution in Section 3 – that the common South African citizen is entitled to same rights, privilege and citizenship.” Meanwhile, Lekota, who is set to be re-elected the party’s President, says South Africans need a new South Africa. He has urged party members to ensure that the people of South Africa vote for COPE. Related Video below:
