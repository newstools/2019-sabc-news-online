The lawyer representing the man believed to be the mastermind behind the killings of seven family members in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, says his client doesn’t have any knowledge of the murders. Fitha Khupe’s bail application is being heard in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto. The 61-year old Khupe is accused of the murders of seven member of the Khoza family in October 2018. Khupe, together with his co-accused Vusi Ernest Mabaso, who died in police custody in Cape Town, face seven counts of murder. Khupe’s lawyer, Gerhard Landman, has told the court that his client maintains he’s innocent, arguing that he had no hand in the gruesome killings. Landman says that on the 27th of October, when the murders were committed, Khupe was at the Gandhi Square in central Johannesburg with a friend, which proves he couldn’t have committed the murders. In his affidavit, Khupe claims that Mabaso fabricated his evidence to falsely implicate him in the crimes. The victims, three women and four children of the Khoza family, were found murdered and their bodies buried under a heap of sand at their Vlakfontein home in October 2018. The bail application continues. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
