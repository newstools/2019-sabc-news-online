After several days of student protests that saw operations at the University of South Africa (UNISA) grind to a halt, management says it expects to return to business as usual from Monday. UNISA will resume all its operations countrywide after the university reached an agreement with its Student Representative Council (SRC) on several issues. The agreement comes after the institution made headlines since last week Monday when hundreds of students went on strike. The SRC had demanded that all students who completed Matric Higher Certificates in 2018 be allowed to register and for all qualifying students to be afforded space in the university. The discussions also addressed issues around enrollment planning, accreditation, provision of laptops and other matters. UNISA says with operations commencing on Monday, 113 000 students have been accepted out of over a half a million applications. Out of 113 000 students, 54 000 are first time enrollments for the 2019 academic year. “I can confirm that following an agreement with the national SRC, the shutdown has been called off with immediate effect. As of Monday 14th January, people can expect that all campuses of the university will be opened. Those who want access the university both work purposes or registration they can do so,” says Martin Ramotshela, UNISA spokesperson. Watch a related video below:
