The Northern Cape Health Department is facing yet another medical malpractice law suit. An elderly man in Klipfontein intends to sue the department after he was diagnosed with gangrene. He says he didn’t receive the necessary medical attention and is set to lose his second leg after losing the first one in 2017. The department is already facing negligence claims totalling R1.2 billion. The department’s Lebogang Majha says: “Because of the laws of governments health system we are not in a position to divulge some of the medical issues especially those pertaining to this medical case. We do not want to trample upon the rights of the patient. We will be admitting the patient today or tomorrow to prepare him for the surgery that will be taking place of Tuesday.”
