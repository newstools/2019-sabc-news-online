The Emfuleni Local Municiplaity says residents whose houses have been flooded in Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg will be offered temporary accommodation at a local community hall. At least 70 houses in Sebokeng have been flooded as a result of persistent wet weather conditions in Gauteng and other inland provinces. The rain is expected to continue into Monday. Emfuleni municiplaity’s spokesperson Stanley Gaba says that they’ll be providing the affected residents with food and blankets. “We’re giving blankets to those that need them because some of their blankets are not usable at this moment, as well as food. We’ll also be giving them food.  Where doors are broken and the gates, those are issues that we’ll look at at a later stage, but those that need accommodation, we’ll take them to the community hall for temporary shelter.”
