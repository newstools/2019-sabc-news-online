The inquiry into the killing of ex-Rwandan spy boss, Patrick Karageya, has been struck off the roll. It’s five years since he was killed in a Sandton hotel on New Year’s Eve. Still no answers on who was responsible for Karageya’s death.  Last week, his family brought an application to the Randburg Magistrate’s Court for the inquiry to be halted and a criminal procedure to be instituted instead. Karageya was found strangled at the Michelangelo Hotel in Sandton in 2013. Despite an investigation and suspects identified within months, an arrest is yet to be effected. “The prosecutions know the suspects and their whereabouts. They also important witnesses,” says Magistrate Mashiyane Mathopa. The suspects, are believed to have fled South Africa for Rwanda just hours after the killing. While South Africa has no extradition treaty with the country . Lawyers for the family argue that there is recourse. “They can ask Rwanda. They can put them on an international arrest list,” says Afriforum’s  Adv Gerrie Nel. The Randburg Magistrate’s Court struck the inquiry off the roll asking the state for more information. “They have giving 14 days to provide information on what steps were taken to arrest Rwandan suspect since police knew their whereabouts and identities,” says NPA regional spokesperson, Phindi Louw. The family is pleased with the development. The still grieving widow, positive that justice will finally be served.
