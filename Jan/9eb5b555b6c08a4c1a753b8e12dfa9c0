The city has announced 18 policy measures to further enhance the healthy development of enterprises in the real economy, and will provide more fiscal and financial support, lower corporate costs and make it easier for firms to do business, the official Chongqing Daily reported on Saturday. Other provinces and regions have also sought to provide more support for the private sector, with the world’s second-largest economy losing momentum aggravated by an ongoing trade dispute with the United States. China’s factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years in December, highlighting the challenges facing Beijing as it seeks to end tit-for-tat trade tariffs with Washington and reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown. In efforts to boost liquidity in the economy, China’s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves for the fifth time in a year.
