Democratic Alliance(DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has urged the South African government to intervene in the crisis that is developing in Zimbabwe. Maimane says South Africa cannot afford to adopt a policy of quiet diplomacy with our crisis ridden northern neighbour. There have been reports of massive looting and chaos as protesters react to the fuel price hike announced by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Maimane was addressing the Cape Town Press Club on his party’s plans ahead of the upcoming elections. He says: “We should intervene in Zimbabwe. We can’t approach silent diplomacy, we have to go there and intervene. Then ultimately hold the Zimbabwe government to account.”
