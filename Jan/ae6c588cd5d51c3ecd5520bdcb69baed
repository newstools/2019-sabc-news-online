The judicial commission of inquiry into state capture will resume in Parktown, north of Johannesburg on Wednesday. The commission will not hear any oral evidence, but will be dealing with an application of a procedural nature related to some of the evidence that will be heard in the days to come. Right2Know Campaign activist Dale T. McKinley says the state capture commission has played a big role in exposing the truth to the people. He says South African citizens needed the commission to get clarity on matters concerning the state. “It is going to be very interesting to see the extent in which the commission broadened its mandate.” The commission was set up amid loud cries of alleged systemic political corruption in which private interests, mainly by the Gupta family, were alleged to have had a significant influence in decision-making of state processes.
