Fuel prices have dropped at midnight with petrol prices decreasing by at least R1.22 a litre. It’s the second big price drop in as many months. The price of diesel dropped by at least R1.53 per litre and illuminating paraffin by R1.23 a litre. The Automobile Association (AA) said last month that higher United States (US) crude output as well as a declining dollar had led to the price drops. AA spokesperson Layton Beard has welcomed the drop in the price of fuel. “This decrease brings the petrol price below R14 again for the first time in a long time so it’s really very good news for motorists. It could have been totally different as we could have been looking at a rand increase but you can be very happy we are going into the new year on such a positive foot,” says Beard.
