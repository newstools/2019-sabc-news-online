Over half of South Africans are living in poverty, that is according to the Poverty Trends Report for 2006 to 2015. The number was confirmed by Stats SA in 2017. The report states that 30.4 million South Africans (55.5%) of the population are living in poverty. There is a belief that ironically the end of apartheid and transition to democracy has bolstered economic empowerment of whites who have become immensely wealthy in the post apartheid era. Indigenous First Nation Advocacy SA’s Anthony Phillip Williams says Black Economic Empowerment is a farce. Speaking on Morning Live, he says empowerment has not trickled down to the lowest of the lowest. He says there is only a few people at the top, while the poor have become poorer. Convener of the National Council of the New Nation Movement Ben Alberts agrees and says South Africans will not unite until the inequality ends. He says inequality is the country’s biggest enemy.
