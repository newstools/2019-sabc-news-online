One person has died while in the midst of the vegetation fire which is raging on at Pringle Bay and Betty’s Bay, in the Overberg. The cause of the fatality is unknown at this stage and it is unclear if the death can be directly linked to the fire. The fire started early on New Year’s day and flared up again after a strong wind on Wednesday. The R44 between Gordon’s Bay and Betty’s Bay has been closed in both directions due to thick smoke in the area. “One female adult passed away last night (Wednesday). A full investigation will be done by SAPS and forensics to determine the cause of death. From the Overstrand Municipality, we want to give our sincere condolences to the family. We also have two orange patients that was also injured in this fire as well as one yellow patient, an 18 month-old-baby. Overstrand Municipality also lost one of its fire engines during the operations last night,” says Lester Smith, Overstrand Municipality Fire chief.
