International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says South Africa is ready to offer Zimbabwe any assistance that it can afford. She was speaking to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Zimbabwe urgently needs cash to deal with its financial woes that have sparked protests. At least a dozen people have been killed and scores wounded following the protests that started after President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced a steep increase in the price of fuel. Sisulu says South Africa is currently considering various options on how to assist the neighbouring country. She has confirmed that she will meet with her Zimbabwean counterparts in Davos. “We are considering anything that we can afford. Right now, the only person who can answer that question is the President and Finance Minister because any financial assistance will depend on whether we can afford it. But any assistance that we can afford we will like to give.” Click below for more on the story:
