Internet connectivity has reportedly been reopened in Zimbabwe. Service provider, Econet, confirmed on Tuesday that they cut Internet connectivity after it received a warrant from the Minister of State in the Presidency. This comes amidst violent protests across the country â€” due to fuel increases of more than 150 per cent. Earlier Human Rights lawyers in Zimbabwe have filed an urgent court application to compel the security and communications ministries to open the internet in that country. 62 of the 200 people arrested during violent protests, are also appearing in a separate court on charges of inciting violence. This follows a mass anti-fuel hike demonstration and the prevailing high cost of living. Minister of information, publicity and broadcasting services, Monica Mutsvangwa told a press conference that the government has called the protests acts terrorism activities.
