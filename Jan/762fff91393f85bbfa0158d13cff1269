Heavy rainfall has again caused flooding at the Savannah Mall in Polokwane in Limpopo. This is the second time in two weeks that the mall has been flooded after heavy rainfall. Some shops were forced to close early as water was flowing inside. People working at various retail stores at the mall have expressed their frustration about the situation. “It is affecting us definitely. I was sick. The drain system has been blocked for a while. The problem is the drainage system,” says one of the workers. One store owner says, “It affecting our business; affecting everything. Now, we lost our customers. We don’t know what to do. I think maybe the management must do something about this. We are losing our customers. They can’t shop in a place like this. There’s a lot of water. The management must do something.”
