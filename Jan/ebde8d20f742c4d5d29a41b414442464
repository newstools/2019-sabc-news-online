Residents of Freedom Park in Soweto, Johannesburg, have threatened a total shutdown if more is not done to deal with the on-going crime in the area. Since November last year, 13 murder cases related to robberies have been opened at the Eldorado Park police station. There has been a surge of violence in the area and residents say they are living in fear. Police recently arrested five suspects allegedly involved in the robberies and murders of tuck shop and local tavern owners. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the suspects will appear again in court on the January 11th. “The case was remanded for further investigation as they are still other cases which we believe they might be involved in and already we had linked them with other incidents which took place in and around Freedom Park.” Click on video below:
