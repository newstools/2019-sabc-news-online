Thousands of commuters will remain stranded on Tuesday morning as Metrobus employees continue their strike action. Metrobus services in Johannesburg came to a virtual standstill on Monday after bus drivers belonging to labour union, DEMAWUSA, tabled a number of demands, including an 18% wage hike. Metrobus spokesperson Goodwill Shiburi says negotiations will continue on Tuesday morning. “This morning, the negotiation will continue with the objective to end the strike. The priority demand is the 18% increase for all employees. The other issue includes investigations, which has been agreed to be subjected to a process.” He adds: “Yesterday we were hoping that the non-striking unions will be able to work, but unfortunately we weren’t able to work because DEMAWUSA members were sitting around at the depots and not allowing people to exit. So we are still expecting disruptions this morning.”
