Several roads have been closed in the Johannesburg area after a severe thunderstorm uprooted a number of trees across the metro. ER24 Spokesperson Werner Vermaak says paramedics responded to one such incident in the northern suburbs. “A 55-year-old man sustained serious injuries when a large tree fell on him while he was walking along Malibongwe Drive in Randburg this afternoon. Paramedics arrived on the scene where they found the man still trapped underneath the tree. ER24’s Rescue Unit used various tools to free the man from underneath the tree. He was treated for multiple fractures and several other injuries. It is understood that a storm passed through the area which resulted in the tree being uprooted and falling over. The man was stabilised on the scene and rushed to Helen Joseph Hospital for further medical care.”
