Humanitarian organisation Gift of the Givers has come to the aid of residents of Wuppertal, in the Cederberg municipality, providing the community with thousands of litres of water and non-perishable food items. More than 50 houses burnt down in the area on Sunday, after a fire broke out and quickly spread to surrounding houses, which have mainly thatched roofs. The fire also destroyed a primary school hostel that housed 230 children, the rectory, a shopping centre and a restaurant. Gift of the Givers Western Cape Project Manager, Ali Sablay, says they will also be assisting the school children who were affected. “We will be providing the kids that were affected in the fire with some stationery packs, school clothing as well as school uniforms. We are just waiting for the list from Disaster Risk Management and then Gift of the Givers will provide those necessities to the kids to start their school year.”
