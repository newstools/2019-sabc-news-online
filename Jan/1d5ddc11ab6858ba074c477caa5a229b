President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to meet Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane in Midrand on Tuesday. It’s reported that the two are to discuss a payment of R500 000 that was made towards Ramaphosa’s election campaign by Bosasa. Last week, Mkhwebane said she would probe allegations that President Ramaphosa lied to Parliament about the 2017 campaign donation. Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko says:”This meeting is to discuss a complaint that the Public Protector would have received that alleges that the President deliberately sought to mislead Parliament when he answered questions in the National Assembly about a donation received from Bosasa.” “Nothing could be further from the truth, upon discovering the true nature of the payment he then informed Parliament of the correction. So the President will answer any allegations in this regard that the Public Protector would put to him.” Related video click below:
