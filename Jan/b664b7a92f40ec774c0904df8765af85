Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he will take action against anyone found guilty of misconduct in the events leading to the death of 18-year-old learner Nicole Mnguni. Mnguni committed suicide last week after allegedly being bullied by her Maths teacher at Vorentoe High School in Johannesburg. It’s alleged that the bullying had been ongoing for a while until she took her own life. In a suicide note left by Nicole Mnguni, she claims the humiliation had been ongoing for months and she hated going to school, and especially to the maths class.  She explains how she was mocked every day. The education department says their systems are lacking when it comes to identifying abuse and bullying of learners in schools. “It also demonstrates that there are serious gaps within the system to identify weaknesses. If a child has to go through this pain and we can’t identify it, why do we have this programmes and these systems? That’s the reason why one is applying his mind,” says Lesufi. When asked about the school allegedly refusing to give Mnguni her year end report, Lesufi says action will be taken against those who are implicated “I want to assure everyone, if there’s somebody that is implicated in that report  we will not hesitate to take any action purely because it can’t be normal that you lose a life like this,” says Lesufi. The school governing body declined to comment- stating that it’s a police matter. Lesufi says he will have a full response by the end of next week. Mnguni’s family plans to have her funeral in Zimbabwe. Watch related video below for more on the story:
