Police have confirmed that three people have been arrested following violent protests at Prophet Shepard Bushiri‘s Enlightened Christian Gathering in Pretoria at the weekend. Police spokesperson, Augustinah Selepe, says the people are charged with public violence and the contravention of the Road Management Act. They will appear in court on Tuesday. Members of the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) have been protesting outside the church at the Tshwane Events Centre, after three women died and nine were injured during a stampede on 28 December last year.
