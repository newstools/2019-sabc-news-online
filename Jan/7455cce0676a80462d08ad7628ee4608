Crawford College La Lucia in Durban North says the commitment by learners and parents helped the school to achieve a 98% pass rate in the 2018 matric exam. Principal – Carolyn Warwick – says the year had no glitches as learners wasted no time and sailed through their subjects. Warwick says the school’s top achiever received 9 distinctions. Across the country 11-thousand learners sat for the Independent Examinations Board exam, achieving a 98.7% pass rate. Crawford College La Lucia’s matrics are expected to arrive later on Thursday with their parents to collect their results. Meanwhile, Kimberley based independent school St Patrick’s Christian Brothers College has achieved a 100% matric pass rate for the eighth year in a row with 90% of the class achieving bachelor degree passes. The school’s top student, Ogechikama Ogu, obtained seven distinctions including a high of 91% for Mathematics and 89% for Accounting. Ogu says her hardwork began long before the start of the exams. “I’m very happy, I’m very proud of myself. I definitely achieved what I wanted to achieve. Before tests I would plan about a week or two weeks ahead to start preparing for the tests and I cut it up into small bits so you study section by section and then the day before you do revision.” Parents and learners gathered at the school to celebrate the 100% pass rate. “I want to thank the leadership of the school. They’ve really put in a lot of effort and thank you to the students as well for putting in their effort.” ”I’m extremely proud. We’ve worked extremely hard for this and it’s something we all bought into at the beginning of the year and I think we pulled it off quite well.” Click on video below:
