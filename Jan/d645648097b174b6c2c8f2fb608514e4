The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says the only reason they suspended their case against Duduzane Zuma was to allow a key witness to conclude giving evidence in the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.  Duduzane, the son of former President Jacob Zuma, has also made himself available to testify before the Commission. Zuma was out on R100 000 bail after being charged with crimes linked to the controversial Estina dairy farm project in the Free State. Corruption charges were also laid from the role he played in a failed attempt to bribe then deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas at the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home in October 2015. Meanwhile, the trial date for Zuma’s culpable homicide case has been set for March 26, 2019. In 2014, Zuma ploughed his Porsche 911 sports car into a taxi on the M1 highway in Johannesburg, killing one woman and seriously injuring another who later died in hospital.
