The South African National Editor’s Forum (Sanef) has appointed an Independent Auditor to probe the alleged donation to the crowd-funding for the SABC8 journalists by the Bosasa Group. This follows allegations published by TimesLive that alleged that Bosasa may have donated an amount of R100 000 in support of the SABC8. The SABC8 were a group of journalists who were suspended in 2016 for speaking out against censorship at the public broadcaster. Sanef Chairperson, Mahlatse Mahlase says they found no evidence that money was received from Bosasa. “We saw that there still continuing doubts and we felt that as part of being held accountable, it is important that we think and have an independent person come in. For us it is important that the media industry does not have a cloud hanging over them. Receiving money to write stories in a particular way or be influenced is against our ethical conduct as journalists and we just wanted to make sure that we clear this dark cloud that is hanging over the industry.”
