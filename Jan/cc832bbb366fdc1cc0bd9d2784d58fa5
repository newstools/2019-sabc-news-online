The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has joined calls by political parties for the Democratic Alliance (DA) to remove the controversial election billboard erected in Johannesburg this week. The billboard has the words #TheANCIsKillingSA. The DA claimed that the billboard was in memory of those who died in the Marikana tragedy, the Life Esidimeni saga and  pit toilet incidents. The party has been criticised for being insensitive to those who have passed on, while the billboard has also sparked outrage among relatives of those who have died. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said the DA must remove the names of the affected families immediately. Holomisa said, “The majority members of the DA only yesterday were part of the national party machinery which killed many blacks in the country. But we have accepted the reconciliation process which was started by Mandela and De Klerk. Let this be the last thing they do – they must remove the names of those affected families without delay.” The billboard has since been vandalised.
