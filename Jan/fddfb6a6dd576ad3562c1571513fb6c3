Residents of Khayamandi Township near Stellenbosch have welcomed government’s intervention to end alcohol abuse and gender violence in the area. The Social Development Department has been meeting with a group of men in the community to address concerns about incidents of rampant abuse. It’s estimated that government spends about R38 billion per year to address incidents of violence and alcohol abuse. Building a community that is free of Alcohol and Drug abuse is a national campaign speared by the Social Development Department. It’s targeting communities with high incidents of alcohol abuse and gender violence. Local taverns have also been roped in to spread the word about the dangers of alcohol abuse. Government says it’s serious about implementing its National Drug Master Plan. Deputy Minister for Social Development Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu says:”This programme is to make men to stop abusing alcohol and drugs. But it is also for us to change the conversation men have when they are around each other so that they become positive role models to our communities.” Civil Society has also been asked to participate in the campaign. Archbishop Mbulelo Dyasi says:“This time around we also want to listen to men because they are also going through a lot. There are stories and we don’t want to assume that those stories are just merely excuses. We want to listen but at the same time give guidance to say the National Agenda is all about ensuring that a girl child is safe and women are safe in this country.” The campaign also encourages conversation with parents and adults about their role in promoting alcohol and drug free societies.
