The ANC’s National List conference will continue in uMhlanga north of Durban on Saturday. The meeting is being attended by the party’s National Executive Committee and ANC allies. It has been convened to consolidate the party’s list of candidates for the National Assembly for the upcoming general elections. President Cyril Ramaphosa, former President Jacob Zuma and SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande are among those attending the meeting. The national list conference will trim the interim list from 800 names to 200 names. ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte explains the process. “What will ultimately happen we will probably end the list at number 200 for the National Assembly. Now there is already 870 names that have been put forward, so what will happen is that people with the highest number of votes tally across the country and they make it to the top 25 percent of the list those names remain untouched. Below that we look at the skills and experience and we hope that we will be able to retain at least a fifty percent to sixty percent of people with experience who have been in Parliament or legislatures before.”
