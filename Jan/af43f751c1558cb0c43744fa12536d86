Parliament can only reinstate former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) Parliamentary Leader Luthando Mbinda as a Member of Parliament pending the outcome of his court application in February. This is according to PAC president Mzwanele Nyontsho following a meeting he had with the Office of the Secretary to the National Assembly on Monday. Mbinda and his former rival Narius Moloto are still engaged in a pending court case in the High Court in Cape Town where Mbinda was challenging his dismissal as a MP by Moloto last year. Nyontsho says he is happy about the progress of the meeting. “We will wait for the 5th of February which is the court date. But we are happy with everything. We have raised a whole lot of issues – the issues of funding, the issue of representation and the issues of having someone participating in the State of the Nation Address. It is a right, we must have that thing. But the reinstatement will happen after the court date of the 5th of February and we hope that day, the judge will just give the order.” Click below for more on the PAC:
