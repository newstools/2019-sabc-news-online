The Eastern Cape Education Department has given King Edward High in Matatiele 14 days to review issues of teaching spaces, teacher allocation and learner segregation. Reports of segregation surfaced at the school where it was alleged that black and white learners from the same grade were taught in different classrooms. The education department met with the school officials to resolve the issues. Education Spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima says they will return to the school in February to the ensure that all issues have been resolved. “The department is also committed to investigate alleged subtle racism, reference by white teachers to learners like, ‘you people and if you are not satisfied with the school, go back to the bush school.’ “We encourage parents to come forward and report these incidents. As such we have opened a toll free line which is 080 1212 570 because we want to ensure we are able to nip and disrupt all these instances where our learners find themselves in these predicaments. It is unacceptable not to offer any Sesotho classes while the numbers of Sesotho learners are bigger than Afrikaans learners. IsiXhosa must also be elevated.”
