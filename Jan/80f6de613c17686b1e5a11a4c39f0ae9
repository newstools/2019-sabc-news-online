Some parents of learners at Hoerskool Stilfontein outside Klerksdorp in the North West have raised concerns about the involvement of some political parties in the current situation at that school. The call comes as some regional and local leaders of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), African National Congress (ANC) and Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) have been at the school since Monday. This is after some angry black parents stormed classrooms and removed their children, after accusing management of racism and discrimination. Carl Kleynhans says he speaks on behalf of some white parents. “The School Act is clear that Section 31 A, that no campaigning is allowed on school grounds and if you are wearing your attire logo you are campaigning. We spoke about this yesterday in the meeting and there should not be political interference. This morning there were a couple of political parties. I think this is uncalled for. This is a learning environment. The campaigning that is happening now should not be allowed. Children are traumatised and teachers are traumatised. Let teachers and the department come with a resolution,” says Kleynhans. Watch a related video below:
