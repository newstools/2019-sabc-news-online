Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi has confirmed that the company paid the legal fees of former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Agrizzi has been testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture taking place in Parktown, Johannesburg. He says Motsoeneng received R1.1 million to pay his legal team that represented him during his disciplinary hearing at the public broadcaster. It was reported last year that Motsoeneng sourced money from Bosasa, but those reports were not confirmed until now by people whoâ€™ve had an association with Bosasa. Agrizzi has been answering questions on allegations contained in an affidavit by former auditor Peet Venter. Click on video below:
