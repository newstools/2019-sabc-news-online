The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has seized a consignment of rhino horns worth over R23 million at the OR Tambo International Airport. The 36 pieces of rhino horn were found after a police dog positively identified a consignment disguised as ‘decoration items’ in a warehouse. Sars officials say the horns, which weighed 116kg and destined for Dubai, were hidden underneath cut laminated wooden sheets in four of the boxes which were filled with doormats and decorative items. Sars Spokesperson, Sicelo Mkosi, has declined to comment on whether anyone has been arrested. “We’re unable to confirm any of those details because investigations are at a sensitive stage and we are wanting to crack down on these individuals. We had become aware that there has suddenly become a demand for these horns in the far east and that we intercepted them and handed them over the police for further investigation so as to ensure that there’s successful prosecution,” says Mkosi.
