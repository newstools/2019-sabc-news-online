The North West Department of Education has postponed a media briefing in which MEC Sello Lehari, was supposed to have made an announcement on the outcomes of investigations conducted at Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke. Lehari appointed a team to probe allegations of racism in the school after a teacher at the school, Elana Barkhuizen, took a photo of black and white Grade R learners seated separately in a classroom. The photo went viral on social media. The teacher remains suspended contrary to Wednesday’s report that her suspension was lifted. “We have postponed the media briefing today as we are still in consultation with our legal department, and we are happy that parents have brought their kids to school today because you will remember that we had a problem whereby kids were not at school. Lessons are continuing as we speak,” says Freddy Sepeng, provincial spokesperson of the Department of Education. Watch a related video below:
