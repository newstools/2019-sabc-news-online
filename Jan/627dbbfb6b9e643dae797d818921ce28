Judgment in the bail application of 40-year-old Soweto-born rapper Thulani Ngcobo, popularly known as Pitch Black Afro, is expected to handed down in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Ngcobo, has been charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice, after being suspected of having killed his wife Catherine Modisane at a Bed and Breakfast business in Yeoville, Johannesburg. Modisane was found dead on New Year’s Eve. Police had initially declared that her death was from natural causes, but after preliminary investigations, it emerged that she had been murdered. His case had been postponed to Friday for the court to verify his address. The court wants to allow the State time to verify with Ngcobo’s aunt, whether she will allow him to live with her should he be granted bail. On Friday, a formal bail application will also be presented to the court.
