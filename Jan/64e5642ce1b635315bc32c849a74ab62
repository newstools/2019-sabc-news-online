The large vegetation fire that has been raging on the mountain slopes of Kogel Bay outside Cape Town has spread to the Steenbras dam catchment area. The fire started in Pringle Bay in the Overberg on New Year’s Day and moved towards Kogel Bay last Sunday. Ten antelope have been euthanised after sustaining various injuries. Just over 8000 hectares of vegetation have so far been burnt. The fire poses no threat to property at this stage. The R44 between Gordon’s Bay and Rooi Els still remains closed.
