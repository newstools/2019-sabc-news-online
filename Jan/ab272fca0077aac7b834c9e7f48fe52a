Firefighters are continuing to battle a large vegetation fire high up in the mountains, above Kogel Bay in Cape Town. The fire, which started in Pringle Bay on New Year’s Day, moved towards Kogel Bay on Sunday. Around 80 firefighters are currently battling the blaze. The fire poses no threat to property at this stage. Cape Town Fire Spokesperson, Theo Layne says the R44 between Gordon’s Bay and Rooi Els remains closed due to the fire. “Fire crews are still battling an extensive area of mountain slopes that is burning. Three helicopters are water bombing the areas that are currently inaccessible to the ground crews and the high wind condition is still hampering all fire fighting efforts.”
