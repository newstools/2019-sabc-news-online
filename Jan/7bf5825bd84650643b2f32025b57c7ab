South Africa uses the metric measurement system, meaning that we use kilometres instead of miles and we use kilograms instead of pounds. The institution tasked with regulating this is the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA). They are on an awareness campaign to educate South Africans about metrology. The Metric system comes from the use of the meter which was started in the late 19th century. The instituteÂ connects the South African measurement system to the international system of units, where for everything that decisions get taken they can confirm that measurements were involved. NMISA develops, keeps and maintains the national measurement standards for South Africa to ensure that they bench mark them with the International system. This goes on to help with supporting trade because the measurements conducted in South Africa can be trusted internationally and enable competition in the international trade system. CEO of the NMISA Dr Ndwakhulu Makhufhi says they form part of the National Equality Infrastructure which includes the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS), South African National Accreditation System (SANAS), the National Regulator (NR) and the NMISA.
