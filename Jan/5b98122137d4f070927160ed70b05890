The four suspects arrested in connection with the theft of electronic equipment at Menzi Primary School on Gauteng’s east Rand, will be appearing at Tsakane Magistrates Court on Monday. The arrests were made on Friday at a shop in the Johannesburg CBD where Police recovered 32 of the 185 learners’ tablets, as well as laptops. The suspects had tied-up two patrollers and locked them in a room before making off with a variety of smart electronics goods on last Tuesday. “The four suspects arrested for the Menzi Primary School robbery will be appearing in Tsakane Magistrates Court this morning, facing charges of business robbery and possession of stolen property,” says Kay Makhubele who is the Police Spokesperson. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has appealed to the police to make school robbery cases their priority as they are hampering the country’s education system. Watch related video below:
