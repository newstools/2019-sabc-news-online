The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has criticised the African Union (AU) over its call for the suspension of the announcement of the final results of the embattled presidential election. The provisional results are being contested before the court by one Candidate Martin Fayulu who claims he won and not Felix  Tshisekedi who was announced earlier by the Electoral Commission. The DRC says the Constitutional Court, which is assessing the legality of the vote, is impartial and credible. Early results list Felix Tshisekedi as the winner but they are being contested by Martin Fayulu. However, some leaked results indicate that Fayulu actually obtained over 60% of the vote. The Catholic Church is also strongly questioning whether Tshisekedi actually won the poll. The decision was taken after an in-depth discussion between the leaders of government from SADC and the Great Lakes region. The continental body says it wants dialogue before a ruling by the DRC Constitutional Court. The heads of state and government plan to urgently dispatch a high level delegation to the DRC to reach a consensus on a way out for the post-electoral crisis in the country. It will include AU Chair, Rwandan President Paul Kgame, the AU Commission Chair and other heads of government. Chairperson AU Commission Moussa Faki Mahammat said “To speak frankly there are serious doubts about the conformity and the compliance of the results. ”
