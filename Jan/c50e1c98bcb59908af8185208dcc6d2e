Learners from two schools which were set alight at the weekend in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands say they are worried that they might not have a place to learn when schools reopen on Wednesday. The Mvuzo High School in Pietermaritzburg and Bathembu High School at uMsinga were both set alight on Sunday by unknown suspects. According to a media statement by the Education Department, uMvuzo High School had recently received threatening messages that the school would be burnt down should learners fail matric. The school obtained a 70 percent matric pass rate which was a 3 percent decline compared to the 2017 results. Returning learners and parents are calling for help.
