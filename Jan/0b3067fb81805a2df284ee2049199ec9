Renewed gunfire and blasts were heard early on Wednesday morning as authorities evacuated around 50 survivors of a militant attack on an upscale hotel and business complex in the Kenya capital of Nairobi, a first responder said. Those saved included a pregnant woman, the first responder said, and the daughter of a former lawmaker. Ex-MP Boni Khalwale tweeted that she had been saved more than 12 hours after Somali militants began their attack. Meanwhile, Kenyan security forces have been searching a hotel complex in Nairobi for the surviving al-Shabaab militants who launched an attack on a complex  killing at least seven people. UN leaders have condemned the brutal terrorist attack. They were speaking at the official handover of the Chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China at UN Headquarters in New York. A suicide bomber detonated explosives in the restaurant before other assailants opened fire. UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres has added his voice to the condemnation of the attack in Nairobi. He said, “Allow me first of all to join my voice to the expression of total solidarity with the people, the government and the president of Kenya and have total condemnation of the horrible terrorist act that we have just heard about.”
