The Thulsie brothers are due back in court on Thursday, nearly three years after they were arrested in Johannesburg on terror-related charges. Tony-Lee and Brandon-Lee were arrested under the Terrorist Act in July 2016. Their trial was delayed for the state to gather information from foreign countries. In September 2017, the United States froze the Thulsie’s assets and imposed sanctions on the two. The brothers are charged with contravening the constitutional democracy of the country by attempting to commit acts associated with terror activities. They face 12 other charges. Lawyers from both sides have been stuck in pre-trial hearings for over a year. They argued that the arrest was unlawful as the police only had a search warrant but the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court ruled otherwise. The defence also challenged the constitutionality of the Terrorism Act. The matter has now been at the High Court for over a year with pre-trial conferences between state and defence. In December, the defence asked for all evidence to be handed in hard copy instead of digital files as it was given. The state has said it would cost them R77 000 to print out the 2 000 evidence files. Click on video below:
