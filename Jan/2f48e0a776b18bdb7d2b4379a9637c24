Deputy Higher Education Minister, Buti Manamela, says infrastructure at some universities is deteriorating due to over-crowding. He visited the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) and Fort Hare University campuses in East London as part of the on-going assessment of admissions, registrations and implementation of improvements at National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in public higher institutions. Manamela says universities and TVET colleges must increase the number of students with existing infrastructure. He says the department has also put aside R12 billion for the building and improvement of infrastructure at historically disadvantaged universities, including TVET colleges. “Of course most of that will be going to maintenance and renovation of the existing infrastructure. We hoping through innovation and creativity, Institution especially TVET colleges will try and ensure that students are accommodated properly,” says Manamela.
