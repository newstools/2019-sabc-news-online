The UN human rights office has called on Zimbabwe’s government on Friday to “stop the crackdown against protesters” and “excessive use of force” by security forces including firing live ammunition. “Doctors’ associations are putting numbers out there, likely that more than 60 people were treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds,” Ravina Shamdasani, UN Human Rights spokeswoman said. She also denounced alleged “intimidation and harassment” by security forces in night-time door-to-door searches, beatings by police, 600 arrests and the shutting down of the Internet and social media. Protests against fuel price hikes in Zimbabwe started on Monday, posing a major challenge for President Emmerson Mnangagwa who replaced long-time leader Robert Mugabe and promised to repair the creaking economy. There is a severe shortage of dollars, fuel and medicines, while inflation hit 31 percent in November, the highest in a decade.
