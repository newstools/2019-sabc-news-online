The Inquiry into the fitness to hold office of suspended National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) senior advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi is set to begin in Pretoria on Monday morning. Jiba, who is the NPA’s deputy head and Mwrebi, the head of the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit, were suspended in October last year by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The Inquiry will be headed by retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro. Jiba and Mrwebi are accused of maladministration and misconduct. This relates to the pair’s handling of several high profile cases including that of former Intelligence Head Richard Mdluli. The two senior NPA advocates have been under the spotlight for several controversies. In July last year the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned a Pretoria High Court ruling striking the pair off the advocates roll. The matter is still pending before the Constitutional Court. Both Jiba and Mrwebi remain on suspension. The first witness to take the stand at the Mokgoro Inquiry will be acting NPA Head Dr. Silas Ramaite. WATCH BELOW:
