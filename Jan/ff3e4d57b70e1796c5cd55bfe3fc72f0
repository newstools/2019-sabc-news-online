The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader in Mpumalanga, Collen Sedibe has been acquitted on all the charges of fraud opened by the provincial legislature against him. Sedibe appeared at the Nelspruit Magistrate Court on Thursday, facing four fraud-related charges. He was accused of forging High Court orders compelling the legislature not to withdraw his official residence. Through his lawyer, Sedibe told the court that he got the documents from a lawyer known as Sibiya, who was later struck from the roll of attorneys. Handing down the judgment, the Magistrate said the state failed to convince the court that Sedibe knew that the documents were not authentic. For related video, click below:
