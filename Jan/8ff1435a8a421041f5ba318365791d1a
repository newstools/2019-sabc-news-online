At least 11 people have been killed and a multi vehicle crash that has forced the closure of the N3 north near Wilge Plaza in the Free State. Motorists are advised to use the R103 as an alternative. Arrive Alive says two cars, a taxi and a truck were involved.  The N3 toll concession has urged people to be patient or to use the R103 instead of the N3. Reports from the scene indicate that a mini bus taxi, two light motor vehicles and a heavy motor vehicle were involved in a collision. Tragically eleven people had sustained fatal injuries, and approximately another eight people sustained serious injuries, according to Netcare 911. One of the patients was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition. Circumstances leading up to the collision are being investigated by the SAPS who were on scene.
