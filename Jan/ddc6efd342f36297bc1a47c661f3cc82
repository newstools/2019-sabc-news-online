Under growing pressure, the Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will meet Life Esidimeni families and take corrective measures if necessary. The party’s “The ANC is killing us” elections billboard, listing the names of Life Esidimeni, Marikana and pit-latrine victims, backfired on it. Life Esidimeni families are considering legal action and the ANC has lodged a complaint with the IEC. The DA on Tuesday restored the vandalised poster, taking another swipe at the governing party, a few hours after the Life Esidimeni family committee resolved to take legal action against the DA, further angering aggrieved family members. It has added a yellow sticker on the the billboard. But the names of the Life Esidimeni, Marikana and the pit latrine victims remain.  The billboard was erected last week and was soon vandalised by unknown people. Family members say they were not consulted and want it removed.
