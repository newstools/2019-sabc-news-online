Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says policy certainty is central to private sector investment. He says government needs to ensure certainty to allow economic agents to contribute towards growth. Mboweni says infrastructure development will also be key in growing the economy. He was speaking at the Business Economic Indaba currently underway at Gallagher Estate in Midrand, north of Johannesburg. The conference is aimed at discussing opportunities for private and public sector collaboration. “Policy certainty is important in the sense that it sends a specific message to the economic agents in the country about whether what’s being done is feasible or not is a different matter.”
