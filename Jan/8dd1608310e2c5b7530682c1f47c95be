The former South African ambassador to the United Nations (UN) Dumisani Kumalo will be laid to rest at the Westpark cemetery in Johannesburg on Saturday. The anti-apartheid activist was a diplomat from 1999 to 2009. Former President Thabo Mbeki and former Foreign Affairs minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are among those who will pay tribute to Kumalo. Ambassador Kumalo served South Africa with distinction as a diplomat. His role at the UN is hailed by many throughout the world. He played an important role in campaigning for South Africa to be a non-permanent member on the Security Council for the first time. It’s during his tenure at the UN where South Africa had to deal with the complex issues on Iraq, Zimbabwe and Libya to name a few. He also contributed in the strengthening of South Africa’s foreign policy. Government’s special official funeral service for Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo is held at the Calvary Methodist Church in Midrand.   WATCH BELOW:
