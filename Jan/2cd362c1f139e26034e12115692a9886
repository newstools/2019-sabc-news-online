Striking contract workers at Exxaro Coal Mine in Lephalale, Limpopo, have halted the project of expanding the mining of coal for export. Hundreds of contract workers at Group Five and SMEI construction company downed tools last week. They are demanding equal pay and bonuses. The two companies have been contracted by Exxaro for the special coal mining project. Some of the striking workers have vowed to continue with the strike until their demands are met. “Our demands here, while we are actually not going to work, we are demanding actually rates; our rates on site are not equal. Actually we are demanding our bonuses, last year bonuses and we are also demanding for the equal rates because you may find that we are working for the very same job but we are not getting the same rates is that what we are fighting for. The struggle will continue until management listens to us. Now we are not gonna go back, forward forever,” the workers say. Exxaro spokesperson Mzila Mthenjane says the two affected companies have committed to resolving the matter on Tuesday. “We have been engaging with companies that are affected which have been working on our strategic project. These companies both reported that they would like to sign a peace agreement with employees who have been on strike. It has had an impact on the project so the project schedule has been affected by almost 10 days and there was also a two day impact on the normal operation of coal production for supply to Eskom and other customers,” explains Mthenjane.
