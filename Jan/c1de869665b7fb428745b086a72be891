Venezuela’s opposition leader and self-proclaimed president, Juan Guaido, has called for new street demonstrations against President Nicolas Maduro. Senior Director of the Johannesburg business school, Lyal White, says that Maduro was not democratically elected as president in 2018 and in the Venezuelan constitution it insists that the National Assembly (NA) will remove the president and put in place an interim president, which is exactly what Guaido has proposed as the National Assembly president. Some countries have not recognized Maduro as Venezuela’s president, but instead recognized Guaido as the rightful leader. White says, “Countries like France, United Kingdom, Germany and Spain have all recognised this interim presidency along with Australia and here we (SA government) are supporting the Maduro government which has suppressed it’s people and really pushed democracy back in all shapes and forms.” Listen to White’s interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/648730">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
