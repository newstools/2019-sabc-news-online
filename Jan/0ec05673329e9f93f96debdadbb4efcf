The Deputy President of the African National Congress (ANC)  David Mabuza says he never sold out any faction within the party during the ANC’s elective conference at Nasrec in December 2017. Mabuza is amongst ANC leaders who are in KwaZulu-Natal, interacting with communities and preparing for the party’s election manifesto launch at the weekend. After the Nasrec conference, supporters of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who was one of the candidates for the ANC presidency, claimed that Mabuza betrayed them at the 11th hour. They were claiming Mabuza did not ensure that delegates from his home province of Mpumalanga vote for Dlamini-Zuma, despite him appearing on her slate as deputy president. “I only preach for unity and what prevailed is unity. That means the branch delegates heard my voice. Heard my story, to say it looks like this person is making sense because if we did not go the way we went, probably we would be talking about the ANC who is limping today. Remember, they took certain people from this faction and took certain people from this faction and they merged them. But the outcome is a combination of both,” says Mabuza.
