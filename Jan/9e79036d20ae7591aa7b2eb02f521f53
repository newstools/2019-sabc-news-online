The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that it will provisionally withdraw corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane. The NPA says it has sent a formal letter to Zuma’s lawyers before his appearance at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday. Zuma was charged with corruption in 2017. This relates to allegations that Zuma was present when members of the Gupta family tried to bribe then Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas in October 2015. NPA Spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane says, “As NPA, we confirm that the letter that has been circulating on social media is an authentic letter written by the NPA addressed to the Defence team representing Mr Duduzane Zuma. More information will be given to the public via the media tomorrow after court proceedings. For now, we cannot comment further as NPA.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
