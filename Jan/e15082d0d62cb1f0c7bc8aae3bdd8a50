Families of the patients who died during the Life Esidimeni relocation project are meeting on Monday to look into suing the Democratic Alliance (DA) for its controversial election billboard. Last week, the party erected the billboard outside the Johannesburg CBD with the names of those who died during the Marikana massacre, the Life Esidemeni incident and the children that drowned in pit latrines as part of its election campaign. It also featured the words “The ANC is killing us” The families of the patients who died during the Esidimeni tragedy say they are upset that the names of their loved ones are being displayed without their consent and prior knowledge. Spokesperson for the families Christine Nxumalo says, “The majority of the bereaved families have expressed outrage at the actions the DA has taken. So we all feel that we need to get together and speak about what possible steps we can take going forward.” “It did come as a surprise, the families felt that they are in the process of grieving and to be disrespected in the manner that the DA did, really just angered the majority, if not all of the families,” added Nxumalo.
