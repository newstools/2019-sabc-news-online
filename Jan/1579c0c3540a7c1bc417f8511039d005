South African Airways (SAA) has announced its decision to shut down operations to and from Blantyre in Malawi. This comes after an inspection by the South African Civil Aviation Authority,  which found that the airport did not comply with a number of international standards. Spokesperson for the aviation regulator, Phindi Gwebu says it is quite pleased with the decision taken by SAA. “The findings were really related to the facilities within the airport that did not meet international standards. We could not get any satisfaction that if a fire were to erupt, either in the aircraft or somewhere in the airport that they would be able to attend to that without anyone losing lives or even facilities being damaged. So we are quite pleased because they have suspended their flights there until all of the requirements are met,” says Gwebu.
