Sentencing proceedings will continue on Wednesday morning at the North West High Court in Mahikeng in the case of the two Coligny farmworkers convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Matlomola Mosweu. Proceedings had to be adjourned on Tuesday, after the mother of the deceased broke down during cross examination. Last year, the High Court found Phillip Schutte and Pieter Doorewaard guilty of killing Matlhomola for stealing a sunflower. On Tuesday, Agnes Mosweu broke down during cross examination. This after state prosecutor, Rapula Molefe, asked her about how she felt after losing her son. The second witness on the matter David Celo, who is Chairperson of Interdenominational Ministries Association in Coligny, told the court that both Schutte and Doorewaard should face harsh sentences. It is unclear whether the defence team will call their witnesses on the matter. However, sentencing is expected this week.
