Former President Jacob Zuma says African National Congress (ANC) members should play a role in ensuring maximum unity within the organisation. He was speaking during the ANC voter registration drive in Bekkersdal west of Johannesburg on Sunday. The ANC has deployed its senior members across the country to encourage potential voters to register and vote in the upcoming elections. The governing party has deployed Zuma in Mohlakeng and Bekkersdal to interact with residents and encourage them to register. He has used the opportunity to urge ANC members to work for unity as the party goes into elections.Â Zuma has also warned ANC members against complacency. He says the ANC needs to win with an overwhelming majority so that it can improve the living conditions of poor people.
