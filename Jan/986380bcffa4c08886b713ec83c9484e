The wife of Andre Hanekom, a South African citizen who’s been arrested in Mozambique, says authorities there aren’t allowing her to have any contact with her husband. Francis Hanekom has denied that Andre is involved in extremist activities and claims that his arrest was a set up by someone who wants to obtain her husband’s property on a Mozambique beach. Andre Hanekom was earlier reported to have been supporting a militant group involved in destabilising northern Mozambique. The militant activities are reportedly linked to the deaths of over 100 people. He is expected to appear in court next week. Francis says she understands that her husband has been locked up in solitary confinement for more than 80 days. “The police commander of Mozambique said on the national TV that Andre was hijacked. How can they say that if they arrested him? It’s a lot of fabrication. He is not in a prison. Under the law, the military is prohibited from holding detainees in military baracks. He’s been locked away for 85 days in solitary confinement, which is also illegal, in a military base and they refuse me to have any contact with him.”
