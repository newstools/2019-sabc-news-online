The African National Congress (ANC) says the party will not take collective responsibility for individual members implicated at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi has already implicated a North West MEC, former Emfuleni mayor Simon Mofokeng and International Relations minister, Lindiwe Sisulu in his testimony last week. Reports suggest that Agrizzi will implicate more high profile individuals when he resumes with testimony at midday. ANC acting spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa says the party is incorruptible. “The ANC doesn’t have a corruption problem, what we have is that from time to time we do have individuals in public service who might have been seen to be acting on behalf of the ANC. The ANC is incorruptible, because when you talk about the ANC you’re talking about the body the African National Congress. There are individuals, some of whom they’re now languishing in jail and we hope this process of the commission will make very clear recommendations and findings which the state must follow,”  says Kodwa.
