Former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer (COO), Angelo Agrizzi, has admitted to being a racist during his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. A recording was played at the Commission in which he can be heard making racist remarks. The recording was made during a meeting with family members of his former boss, Gavin Watson. Agrizzi also says Watson and his brothers offered him between R5 million and R10 million a year for five years to silence him on the alleged dirty dealings they had with government. “I’m embarrassed of myself, I’m ashamed of myself for ever doing that but please just understand the context, no sleep, I was beside myself. I’m not making excuses you can even hear me slur I haven’t made any excuse about this but once again chair I am a racist I agree, judge me on that, it’s fine,” says Agrizzi.
