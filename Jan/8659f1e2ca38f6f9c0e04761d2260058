Transnet Board Chairperson, Popo Molefe, says very soon the country can expect a number of prosecutions regarding state capture and corruption. Transnet management is set to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, considering the evidence that is unfolding about it. Summons have been issued for its former top executives implicated in financial mismanagement. They include axed CEOs Siyabonga Gama and Brian Molefe, ex-Chief Financial Officers Anoj Singh and Garry Pita. Molefe says there is a paradigm shift in the country under the rule of President Cyril Ramaphosa and all those implicated will be held to account. “Since the new President took over there’s a radical change in regard to those matters. We see now very serious officers dealing with these matters. The SIU, for example, the Hawks themselves, are back in business and they are doing their job. We are cooperating with them and we think that very soon we are going to see a series of prosecutions. The fact that we got a new NDPP means that there is a paradigm shift in the mindset and therefore, we are going (to see) seriousness in enforcing the laws of the country.”
