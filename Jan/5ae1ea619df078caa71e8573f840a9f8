Parliament’s former Correctional Services Committee Chairperson Dennis Bloem says it’s his duty as a citizen to testify at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. He has approached the commission to share information about alleged corruption involving Bosasa, Correctional Services and various dodgy contracts during his time as committee chairperson. Bloem is a former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP), who was Correctional Services Committee Chairperson from 2004 until 2009, before joining the Congress of the People. Bloem says, “The reason why I have decided to go and approach the commission is because I feel it’s my duty and obligation to go and tell the commission what I know about the corruption that has taken place in the Department of Correctional Services during my term as a former chairperson of the Portfolio Committees on Correctional Services.” “The Corruption that involved  Bosasa, Sondolo, the out sourcing of kitchens, the fencing, the television sets that were bought  by the department during my time as chairperson. Unfortunately, I cannot go into detail about what I am going to say to the commission. I hope that people must understand that I am not in a position,” says Bloem.
