The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) says it expects a heavy flow of traffic this weekend as most residents will be returning home to Gauteng. This as we approach the end of the festive season and most people will be making their way back from different parts of the country. JMPD’s Spokesperson,Wayne Minnaar, has urged motorists to be cautious on the roads. “Motorists are encouraged to drive with caution, to drive within the speed limit, to keep a safe following distance and not to overload vehicles this weekend. And also remember to buckle up and look at your mirrors all the time.” Traffic volumes have started picking up as many holiday makers return to Gauteng and other destinations. There’s already an increase in traffic flow on the N1 and N3 highways. Gauteng Traffic Police have called on motorists to adhere to the rules of the road. JMPD’s Busaphi Nxumalo says, “Our roads are extremely busy starting this morning, on the N3 plaza we had 1845 vehicles per hour. And on the N1 Phumlani Plaza we had about 930 vehicles recorded per hour. We want to warn our road users about bad behaviour on our roads. They must not drink and drive, they must not exceed the speed limit and they must also fasten their safety belt.” Watch related video below:
