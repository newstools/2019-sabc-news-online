The Basic Education Department has advised 2018 matriculants to check with the department, if the institutions of higher learning at which they would like to study are legitimate. The department’s spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga has warned them against being duped by bogus institutions. See Tweet below: “We’ve seen a lot of young people who go to these institutions for three years or the next day they do not find it there anymore. Or when the qualifications authority is going through the documents to verify only to find out they were not registered. And it’s always been difficult for people to recover their money. We know there’s desperation for young people to go into institutions of higher learning but you shouldn’t do that at all costs.” Click on video below:
