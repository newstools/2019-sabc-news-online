Police in Gauteng have expressed concern over the high number of sex related crimes committed over the festive season. Twenty five suspects were arrested for sex crimes since the start of the festive season. Over the same period, police also recovered 13 fire-arms while conducting festive season operations. More than thirty illegal liquor outlets were also shutdown. “We are still concerned about the abuse of alcohol and indulgence of drugs that might have contributed to a number of sexual offences that have been committed since the beginning of this year. 25 people have been arrested for these sexual related offences of which 19 are due to appear in various magistrates courts today on charges of rape,” says Lungelo Dlamini, Police spokesperson.
