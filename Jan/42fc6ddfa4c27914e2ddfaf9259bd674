The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume at 10 o’clock on Thursday morning. On Wednesday, former Bosasa employee Frans Vorster explained how he carried large amounts of cash to various meetings with the former Correctional Services CFO Patrick Gillingham. Vorster said BOSASA CEO Gavin Watson gave him the money in an envelope. He told the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that the money helped Bosasa secure a catering deal with the Correctional Services Department. “When Gavin called me to the head office, he gave me cash that would go with me. I don’t know if he had an agreement with Patrick but I didn’t question it.  It varied from 10 000; sometimes it was 5 000. The most was around 20 000 in cash. That led to us getting the catering contract that was awarded to us in 2004.” Click video below for more:
