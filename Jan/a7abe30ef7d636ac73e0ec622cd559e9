The African National Congress (ANC) leadership says it is ready for the launch of its election manifesto on Saturday, with all safety measures in place at the Moses Mabhida stadium in Durban. The event which thousands of ANC supporters are expected to attend, will include the party’s 107th anniversary celebrations. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said those who will attend the event are expected to adhere to all the rules of safety. Magashula said, “All control measures have been put in place to ensure that people are safe, we’ll also prohibit items such as fire arms, dangerous weapons, no alcohol, as well as any t-shirt or placard that are insulting or divisive. The gates of the stadium will open exactly at 7 when the cultural programme will commence and at ten o’clock immediately the president is expected to launch the manifesto.” Buses transporting thousands of party supporters have already arrived in the city in preparation for the event. The People’s Manifesto as it is called by the ANC, is the ammunition the party hopes will help it fight and secure a decisive victory in the upcoming poll. The ANC will be supported at the event by its alliance partners as well as fraternal political parties across the SADC region. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the party’s election offering, with the party hoping to fill the 85 000 seat stadium to capacity. Meanwhile, ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini led a women’s march in the Durban city centre on Friday night. The aim of the march was to highlight the plight of victims of gender-based violence. During the march, issues that ordinary women face were raised. They included the killing of young women by their partners. Later, Dlamini addressed the gathering, after which women held a night vigil ahead of the party’s anniversary celebrations at the Moses Mabhida stadium.
