Gauteng’s Emfuleni Local Municipality says it’s now working with the Defence force on clearing drainage channels to allow for storm water to make its way out of the residential area of Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg. Seventy houses were flooded in Zone 6 due to heavy rains in the past couple of days. Fifty families are cleaning up at their homes – while the other 20 have been offered temporary accommodation at a local community hall. Emfuleni municipality’s spokesperson Stanley Gaba says, “The main problem here has been the riverbank. It broke down and flooded the entire community, so we need to contain that. So we have enlisted the services of the South African National Defence Force to help us repair that bank immediately and we’re waiting for SASSA to come and help us with the food parcels for those 20 families.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
