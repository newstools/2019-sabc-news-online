Continuing his testimony, former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi told the State Capture Inquiry that Bosasa used front companies like Sondolo IT to secure a tender worth R225 million rands. This was for installation of television sets at correctional facilities across the country. Agrizzi also revealed how a catering contract at correctional facilities was extended. This was apparently green-lighted by former Acting National Correctional Services Commissioner, Nontsikelelo Jolingana. He has also told the Commission how the facility and management company used front companies such as Phezulu Fencing to obtain a fencing and security tender at the country’s correctional facilities. Agrizzi is continuing his testimony at the commission underway in Parktown in Johannesburg on Tuesday. He has told the commission how at the time when the tender was about to be released, Bosasa had negative publicity surrounding it. Agrizzi says this was the biggest fencing tender in the country and probably in the southern hemisphere – a task Bosasa did not have the capacity to carry out. “We had to avert any negativity at that stage towards Bosasa and the only way you would avert this, -because this is a massive contract, one of the biggest fencing contracts ever done because they didn’t want attention – we said Phezulu is there; award the contract to Phezulu. And on top of that the sale would only go through to Phezulu once the contract had been awarded to Phezulu.” Click on video below for more on the story:
