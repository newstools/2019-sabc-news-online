Academic activities at the University of South Africa (Unisa) campuses across the country are expected to resume on Monday. This after the university reached an agreement with its Students’ Representative Council. Students went on strike last week to demand that all students who had completed higher certificates in 2018 be allowed to proceed with their registrations. Some qualifications have also been suspended as they have not yet been accredited by the South African Qualifications Authority. Unisa’s Martin Ramotshela says:”I can confirm that following an agreement with the National SRC the shut down has been called off with immediate effect. As of Monday 14th January, people can expect that all campuses of the university will be opened. Those who want to access the university, both for work purposes or registration, they can do so.”
