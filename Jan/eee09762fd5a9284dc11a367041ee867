The Khula Development Trust, an NGO looking into the rights of children and women in the Eastern Cape, says it’s gravely concerned about the safety of learners and teachers. Earlier this week, a 15-year-old boy was allegedly stabbed and killed by a fellow 16-year-old learner at the Mpeko Primary School in Peddie. This is the second such incident in less than six months. Director of the Khula Development Trust, Petros  Majola, has called on the department to take the issue of safety at schools seriously. “I have approached the department to say let us sit down so that we can see what is it that we want to do because all schools must be fenced. Secondly, there should be access control at the entrance of the school premises, whether it will delay the kids to enter the school, but we cannot just open it to everyone to walk in and out,” explains Majola.
