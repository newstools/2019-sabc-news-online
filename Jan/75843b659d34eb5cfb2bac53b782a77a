The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) will meet with the City of Tshwane on Wednesday to discuss the future of prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering Ministry in Pretoria. Sanco Gauteng Spokesperson Abraham Mashishi says they will also ask the Hawks and chapter nine institutions to investigate the finances and legality of the church. Members of the civic organisation have been protesting outside the church at the Tshwane Events Centre since the weekend after three women died and nine others were injured during a stampede on December 28th. Congregants started pushing each other as they tried to find shelter during a heavy storm around Pretoria. Mashishi says the church has become a commercial entity which doesn’t care about its members. “They must look into the legal compliance of the church to fulfil its contractual obligation. And the technical part, as Sanco, we are not interested. We just want to see the contract cancelled with immediate effect. If they are willing to take the city to court we are willing to back the city because that is a public facility. In actual fact, it is wrong for the public facility to be hired to a private person. All the illegal churches that are here must all be swept out. All churches that are not registered must be closed,” says Mashishi. Watch the video below for related news:
