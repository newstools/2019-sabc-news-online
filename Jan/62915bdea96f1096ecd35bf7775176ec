An alleged member of the Mdantsane based Endumisweni Faith Mission church in the Eastern Cape, which has been severely criticised after videos showing two young women being beaten surfaced, has defended the practice. Two videos of two young women in their early 20s surfaced showing them being beaten with a pipe in a church. It’s alleged the girls had gone to the cinema with friends and posted about their trip on Facebook. The church has defended itself, saying they employ corporal punishment as one of their disciplinary methods. Tsidi Spampul-Mnyatama says she is the woman seen beating the girls. “South African leaders have spoilt our children. The reason why our youth are misbehaving is that the government instructed that corporal punishment should be banned. Today, children are beating up their parents. Is that what the government wants?” The church involved has indicated it will respond to the video on Sunday. However, the Council of churches has condemned the incident. Provincial Secretary, Phumezo Jaxa explains, “When we see the human rights violation as portrayed on this graphic video, we must indeed condemn in the strongest sense what is happening. And we make a call to the law authorities, the Human Rights Commission to investigate this human rights violations in that particular place of worship.” VIDEO BELOW HAS CONTENT OF A SENSITIVE NATURE:
