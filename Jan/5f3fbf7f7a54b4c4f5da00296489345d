President Cyril Ramaphosa says the work of the various commissions probing allegations of state capture and fraud and corruption in the country is a cathartic way of ridding the country of past transgressions and to pave the way for redemption. The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, the Mokgoro Enquiry into the fitness to hold office of suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority officials, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi’s and the investigation into the affairs of the Public Investment Corporation are all ongoing as the President represents the country at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. President Ramaphosa says he has assured potential investors that everything is being done to root out corruption and maladministration in the country and hold those accountable to book. “These commissions are commissions to bring out the truth and in a way, they are cathartic in nature; they’re painful; they are heart wrenching. But we must stay committed because in the end, they should lead us to redemption and come out of this very painful process…, having discovered how bad things were and how things can be put right. The commissions will come out with recommendations which in the end will have to be acted on.” President Ramaphosa says government continues to endeavour to create policies that will treat all citizens in an equal manner. The President says the only way to move forward is to build unity and cohesion amongst the South African people. President Ramaphosa announced on Wednesday that foreign investment in South Africa has increased by over 400% in the past year.
