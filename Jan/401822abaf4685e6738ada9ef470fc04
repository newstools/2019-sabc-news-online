Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says his party will write to the President to ensure that land expropriation without compensation does not become law. Maimane was speaking on the side lines of a Parliamentary tour with Banyana Banyana. Late last year, both houses of Parliament adopted a report by the Joint Constitutional Review committee that the Constitution should be changed to enable expropriation without compensation. Maimane says his party will oppose this. “Ultimately , we are taking the process to court. It’s been irregular. I will be writing to the presidency that this law must not be signed into place because also we don’t know what the amendment is going to look like.”
