Zimbabweans are accusing President Emmerson Mnangagwa of failing to live up to pre-election promises to kick-start growth in the country as fuel price protests continue. Earlier on Tuesday, a helicopter fired teargas to disperse protesters in a township in Zimbabwe’s capital Harare. Social media and phone lines have been closed as a national shutdown enters its second day. At least three people have been killed after police allegedly used live ammunition against protesters. Zimbabwe police have fired teargas to disperse protesters in the country’s second biggest city, Bulawayo. Police moved in after protesters chanted for the removal of President Mnangagwa and started looting businesses in Bulawayo. Zimbabwe’s mobile phone networks and internet are partially shut down amid the ongoing protests while banks, schools and businesses in Harare remained shut. An MP from the opposition MDC Alliance, Kukaka Buloo, says the situation is volatile. From the time that the current government was elected, there has been no progress on how the economy is going to be fixed because people have been starving for the past few months. They are unable to pay for transport to go to school and buy basic commodities.
