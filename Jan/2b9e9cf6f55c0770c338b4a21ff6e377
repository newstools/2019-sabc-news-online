Head of the Department of Correctional Services in KwaZulu-Natal Mnikelwa Nxele has been suspended. According to a statement from the department, it is a ‘precautionary suspension’ linked to a process that began earlier this month. Nxele is one of several officials of the department who have been implicated in the testimony of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Agrizzi claimed that Bosasa paid Nxele about R57 000 to undermine former National Commissioner of Correctional Services, Vernie Peterson, who didn’t want anything to do with the company. Meanwhile, the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha says officials implicated in corrupt activities in the Correctional services department must face the full might of the law. Masutha has welcomed the work of the commission as a right step in uncovering corruption in his department. He says all officials implicated in Agrizzi’s testimony must face the full might of the law. Masutha spoke on the sidelines during an oversight visit on service delivery in the North West. He has encouraged all individuals with information on corruption within government to speak out. “One assumes officials out there do the right thing until it is exposed that in fact in some instances, people have been taking bribes…the law must take its cause.  And so I can only welcome more evidence. We actually encourage people to report these incidents so that they can be investigated and action be taken.” Masutha also learned of various challenges facing inmates and detainees at Rooigrond Correctional Services in Mahikeng. Among inmates concerns is to be locked up behind bars for years while awaiting trial.
