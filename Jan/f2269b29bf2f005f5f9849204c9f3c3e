South African businessman André Hanekom died in a prison hospital in Pemba in Mozambique. Hanekom was arrested on numerous charges relating to terrorism after he was initially reported kidnapped in Mozambique last year. His wife Francis has been campaigning for his release and pleading his innocence.  The 62-year old Hanekom lived in Mbombela in Mpumalanga and owned a maritime logistics company in Mozambique.
