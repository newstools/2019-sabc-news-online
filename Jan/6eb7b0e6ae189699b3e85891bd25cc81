The University of South Africa (UNISA) has extended the registration deadline for undergraduate qualifications to Thursday. It however says the academic programme for the year, including submission of assignments and examinations remains unchanged. There have been delays in registrations due to a strike, which has since ended. UNISA spokesperson Martin Ramotshela says the university is also open for registration on Saturday between 8am and 14pm. Ramotshela has appealed to all students to register as soon as possible and not to wait for the final date, saying they can also do so online. “We do confirm as UNISA that a decision was taken by management of the university yesterday to extend the registration deadline to Thursday the 31st of January 2019. Further to that we also wish to confirm that the initial date that was set for people to make payment so that the registration is finalised, remains the 31st of January 2019.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
