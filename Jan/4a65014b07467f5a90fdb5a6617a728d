African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has commended KwaZulu-Natal police for dealing with politically-motivated killings. He was unveiling the ANC’s election manifesto at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Ramaphosa says Police Minister Bheki Cele’s establishment of a task team to deal with the political violence has started to yield positive results. Ramaphosa says politically-motivated killings will not be tolerated. “We applaud the police of our country for the wonderful work that they have been doing, but especially, in arresting those who have been involved in killings here in KwaZulu-Natal . However, one political killing is one too many. ” Meanwhile, the ANC wants the Reserve Bank to take into account goals such as job creation and boosting economic growth alongside its current focus on price stability. Ramaphosa says stakeholders should work together to improve the economy and create the much-needed jobs. “We should work together to grow the opportunities available to our people. Let us grow the economy, so that all may have decent jobs and an improved quality of life.”   EMBED: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5683706-ADDRESS-by-PRESIDENT-CYRIL-RAMAPHOSA-at-the.js", {
