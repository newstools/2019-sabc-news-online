Maize farmers in the North West say more rain is still needed to better production. Farmers say although most parts of the province encountered rainfalls in the past few days, the drought is still far from over. In most parts of the North West areas, some maize farmers have had about 8 millimeters of rain over the past few days. Jan George Pretorius, one of the biggest maize farmers in Sannieshof areas, says the rainfall so far is not good enough. “We had some rain, is not nearly enough. Some guys in the area had a bit more rain and we are planting here with about 8 millimeters and we are bit worried. We need some more rain and the problem is time for maize is running out very quickly now, so we are taking risks. Most farmers are taking risks but we need urgent rain.” For more, watch video below:
