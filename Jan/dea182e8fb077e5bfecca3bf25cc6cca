The water crisis facing Kimberley’s Sol Plaatjie municipality in the Northern Cape has worsened leading to stage five water restrictions. The municipality has been battling to keep its Newtown reservoir full since November last year. The municipality says old and damaged infrastructure, coupled with increased water usage due to climate change is a major cause for continued water problems. The municipality’s spokesperson Sello Matsie says water supply will be shut down from 6pm to 4am on weekdays, and on weekends from midday on Saturday to midday on Sunday. Matsie says the level five restriction is effective immediately. He says, “With the heatwave and weather conditions, the consumption is much more than we can supply and it hasn’t improved since November last year. So, currently we want to reduce the times for supply.” Related Video Below:
