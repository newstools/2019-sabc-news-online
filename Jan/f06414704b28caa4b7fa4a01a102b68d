Both the state and the defence teams in the case of the two Coligny farmworkers convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Matlomola Mosweu are expected to present their closing arguments at the North West High Court in Mahikeng. This week, the state called three witnesses to be cross examined on the aggravating of sentence and mitigation in the case of Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte. Doorewaard and Schutte were found guilty of killing Matlhomola for stealing a sunflower. On Wednesday, the third and last witness Agnes Mosweu was asked about the reaction of other family members about the sad news of their brotherâ€™s killing. Mosweu said the family was hurt, especially because the accused did not show any sign of remorse. When asked by the defence team whether they will accept their clients apology, Agnes said the apology will not bring their child back. She further said that they will not even forgive them at any given stage. Sentencing is expected soon.
