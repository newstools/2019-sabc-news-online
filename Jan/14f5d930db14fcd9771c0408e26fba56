Opposition parties have called on Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga to resign with immediate effect or the ANC-brought motion of no confidence in him will go ahead. Msimanga has already officially resigned as the city’s executive mayor effective from 11 February. Both the ANC and the EFF want the caucus to vote on whether Msimanga should stay for another 14 days.  The ANC’s caucus leader in Tshwane, Lesego Makhubela says that Msimanga must leave effective immediately as the city will be funding him while he is still in office. “Speaker all that we are asking for is that the resignation of councillor Msimanga must be effective immediately and secondly we are not going to accept because between now and then he says he wants to go, there no material bearing in it, but the city will be funding him to go in Gauteng therefore it must be effective immediately.”
