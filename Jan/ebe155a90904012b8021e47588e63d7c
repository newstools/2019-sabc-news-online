The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on teachers union Sadtu to end their strike in Eldorado Park and Kliptown, south of Johannesburg. The teachers went on strike last week over allegations of racism. The DA says it’s unacceptable for any union to hold schools and teachers at ransom. Gauteng’s DA Shadow MEC for Education Khume Ramulifho says they support the no-work-no-pay principle. “We do not pay teachers who are not at work, who are not teaching.” “And the no-work-no-pay rule will be the best thing to be taken, but further than that we need serious disciplinary hearing so that we don’t allow our teachers just to decide not to teach our learners.”
