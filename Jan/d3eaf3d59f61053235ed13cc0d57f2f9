The University of Pretoria (UP) recently announced that the institution will be phasing out Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. Established in 1908 as the Transvaal University College in 1930, the University College was upgraded into a fully-fledged independent University and since 1932 became an exclusively Afrikaans institution. AfriForum’s Alana Bailey who is responsible for language policy says, “We have been engaged with the University of Pretoria about the language policy for a long time now and we actually hoped that they would retain Afrikaans and English both as mediums of instructions and would bring in a third language. But we had a court case against them and we lost the case against them.”   University of Pretoria’s SRC member, Jacobus Gordier reacts:  The institution’s SRC president David Kabwa.
