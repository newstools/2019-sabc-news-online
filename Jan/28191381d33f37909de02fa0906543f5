Former Lesotho Prime and Leader of Democratic Congress has handed over the reins of power to his newly elected successor Mathibeli Mokhothu. Mokhothu emerged as clear winner after thrashing his contender Tlohang Sekhamane, who attracted less than 100 votes of nearly 2000 delegates that attended a three days conference. The 78 year-old Bethuel PakalithaÂ Mosisisili recently announced his retirement from active politics, thus opening a fierce leadership contest. Hundreds gathered to witness a long-term leader of the congress movement hand over the reins of party leadership. A long-term Mosisili handed over the bible, the constitution and the part flag to the incumbent. The opposition alliance has praised Mosisili for exemplary leadership. The young incumbent has promised to hit the ground running. Only 40 years-old, Mokhothu is already occupying an official opposition seat in parliament and promises to go around the country encouraging those who have lost hope to renew their membership and come to work. He further extended his hand to his contender to come and work hard to rebuild the party and show unity. Related video click below:
