The South African Police Service (SAPS) has blocked protestors from entering VodaWorld in Midrand, Johannesburg – after Vodacom missed a 10AM deadline by the #PleaseCallMe Movement. Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, says they have suspended operations for the day amid the protests. The group wants the telecommunications giant to resolve a stalemate with Nkosana Makate – who was an employee of the firm when he is alleged to have thought of the ‘Please call Me’ idea. It was reported that Vodacom offered to pay an undisclosed settlement amount after a constitutional ruling in 2016; however Makate rejected the offer and maintains that he should receive 15% of the revenues generated by the Please Call Me product saying, this was the original agreement he had with Vodacom verbally. Meanwhile Kennedy says, “There was a Constitutional Court order that laid out a deliberate process. We fully complied with the Constitutional Court order. We are playing it by ear and our absolute priority today is the safety and security of our staff,” he adds. Click related video below:
