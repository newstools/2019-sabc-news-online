The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says its decision to provisionally withdraw charges against businessman, Duduzane Zuma, was purely strategic. The son of former President Jacob Zuma was charged with corruption in 2018 in connection with the controversial Free State Estina dairy farm project. It was also alleged that Zuma was present when members of the Gupta family tried to bribe then Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas in October 2015. NPA Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says Zuma is due to appear before the State Capture Commission and prosecutor’s decided to allow that process to go ahead first. “As a state, we obviously employ different strategies. Let me say the law in its nature is divergent. The interpretation of the law in its nature is divergent. So, the prosecutors prosecuting this matter felt it was necessary to wait for that process; not necessarily meaning every prosecutor will decide that if somebody is in front of the State Capture Commission a criminal case cannot proceed.” Click video below for more on the story:
