The DA has called on the Public Protector to release the details and outcomes of her meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa. On Tuesday, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane met with the President and the presidency said the two would discuss a payment of R500 000 that was made towards Ramaphosa’s ANC election campaign by Bosasa. Last week, Mkhwebane said she would probe allegations that Ramaphosa lied to parliament about the 2017 campaign donation. The DA laid a complaint with the Public Protectors office over the matter. Party spokesperson Solly Malatsi says, “Given the national interest in this issue, it would be fair game for the public protector to share with the public what the outcome of that meeting was.” “At this stage, we are left to speculate what that meeting could have discussed. We are interested in the fact that you know the PP agreed to investigate and it is important that that investigation is seen to take place fairly and consistent with the values of that office. So that there can be no sense whatsoever that there is preferential treatment granted to the president. We need to get the truth and there needs to be transparency.”
