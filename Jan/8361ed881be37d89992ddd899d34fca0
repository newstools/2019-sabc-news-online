Former Bosasa CFO Andries van Tonder has confirmed to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that misrepresentations were made to SARS about the dodgy dealings between Bosasa and government. He explained that a company called SeaArk – which was involved with “prawn” manufacturing – was a 100% subsidiary of Bosasa Operations, and was funded by the Bosasa Group. He says they paid consulting fees to Sustainable Resources International, saying it is a United States company. Van Tonder says he presented evidence to SARS where he had to show that the project continued by building a “prawn” production company in Krugersdorp, west of Johannesburg.  He says while there was a loss of R38 million in this process, his former boss Gavin Watson insisted that it counted. “He instructed Carlos Bonifacio who was the Head of Accounts department at Bosasa Operations at the time, to attend to it and make sure the operation gets shut down.” Meanwhile State Capture chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says they have no intention to hinder people who want to come forward and give evidence. This follows numerous complaints brought to the Commission’s legal team that those implicated in former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi’s evidence – that they were not approached in advance to submit responses to the Commission. Zondo says they are more than willing to allow all South Africans who feel they can add value to the work of the Commission and get to the bottom of State capture. Click video below:
