The City of Tshwane says it will soon embark on processes to regularise the controversial multi-billion-rand Glad Africa tender. This follows Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu’s finding that the R318-million that the City of Tshwane had paid the Midrand-based engineering consultancy company did not comply with supply chain management regulations. The amount is part of the R1,8-billion that the metro incurred in irregular expenditure in the 2017-2018 financial year. Embattled city manager, Moeketsi Mosola, has insisted that the contract is above board and any allegations of transgressions are baseless. The Auditor-General has blamed Metro Mayor Solly Msimanga, for failing to perform his oversight duties over Mosola. Msimanga’s spokesperson Samkelo Mghobozi says, “We have to apply our minds and enter a process of regularising that contract or getting the city out of that contract. There are legislative processes that council must contemplate and then there are judicial processes that we must also investigate in this regard given an audit opinion of the Auditor-General. Judicial processes, we are saying to whether or not to go to court to set the contract aside, to declare the contract invalid.”
