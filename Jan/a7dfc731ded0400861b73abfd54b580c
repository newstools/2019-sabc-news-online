The Johannesburg Metro Police Department says an investigation is already under way into a scam involving the selling of fake JMPD jobs. Four suspects were arrested in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg, earlier on Friday for allegedly selling fake JMPD jobs to more than 100 students from different provinces. The students paid R15 000 each for the jobs. The suspects will appear in court on Saturday. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says:”The investigation has already started and on Monday we will definitely call a press conference on the 14th of January, to review how they were actually able to notify these young people that they have these fake jobs.” Click video below:
