DA leader Mmusi Maimane has urged people to register to vote in the final registration weekend ahead of the 2019 general elections. He was speaking as the party officially launched its voter registration poster at the Baragwanath taxi rank in Soweto. Registrations will be held on the last weekend of this month – January the 26th and the 27th. Maimane says the DA wants to bring about more change in Gauteng. He says, “All of these posters they will be going up all across the country, they are already going but furthermore we want to say the people of our country we’ve got the candidates ready to serve the people of our country – a new generation of leaders and ultimately we want to bring the change especially here in Gauteng where too many of our people don’t work. For now, we are focusing on making sure that people are registered so they can vote. South Africans can win this province.”
