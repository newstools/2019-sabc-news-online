The family of the deceased 15-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu have told the North West High Court in Mahikeng, that they will not accept an apology from the families of Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte. Matlhomola Mosweu’s mother Agnes, was speaking during cross-examination. She was the third and last witness this week. Doorewaard and Schutte were found guilty of killing Matlhomola Mosweu for stealing a sunflower. During the cross examination by the state, Advocate Rapula Molefe, requested Matlhomola’s mother to contain herself. When asked by Advocate Molefe about the reaction of other family members about the sad news of their brother’s killing, she responded that they were hurt especially because the accused did not show any sign of remorse. When asked by the defence team whether they will accept their clients’ apology, Agnes said they will not, adding that the apology will not bring their child back. She further said that they will not even forgive them at any given stage. Meanwhile both the state and the defence team will present their closing arguments on Thursday.
