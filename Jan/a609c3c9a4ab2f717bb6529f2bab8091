The prosecution has asked the Durban Regional Court to sentence Fees Must Fall leader – Bonginkosi Khanyile – to house arrest, combined with correctional supervision. Defence advocate has told the court that Khanyile has been accepted by the University of KwaZulu-Natal as a Master’s student in public administration. It is envisaged that he would live on Howard College campus. Khanyile was a student at the Durban University of Technology at the time of the protests. Khanyile has pleaded guilty to charges of public violence, failing to comply with police instructions and the possession of a dangerous weapon. Senior state prosecutor – Roshiela Benimadho – has told the court that the students armed themselves with slingshots before the march in 2016 when Khanyile used it to shoot at police officers. She asked the court to send a strong message that the constitution does not protect violence during acts of civil disobedience. Magistrate Simphiwe Hlophe is due to hand down sentence later.
