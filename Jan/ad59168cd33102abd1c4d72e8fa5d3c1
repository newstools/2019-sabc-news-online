Embattled Renault boss Carlos Ghosn has resigned, France’s economy minister said Thursday ahead of a board meeting at which the French car maker is to appoint his successors. A senior director from the firm “received last night the letter of resignation from Carlos Ghosn”, who remains detained in Japan, Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told AFP. The Renault board is to meet Thursday at its headquarters near Paris and is tipped to name interim chief executive Thierry Bollore as CEO and the head of tyre manufacturer Michelin, Jean-Dominique Senard, as chairman. Ghosn, who had held both roles, is expected to stay behind bars for several months after seeing a second bail request denied on Tuesday. He faces three separate charges: two of under-declaring his income by tens of millions of dollars over eight years and another of seeking to shift personal investment losses onto Nissan.
