Statues of former African National Congress (ANC) Presidents situated on Durban’s M4 Ruth First Highway are attracting curious onlookers and begging a few questions. The life size sculptures capture the ruling party’s 12 former presidents like Chief Albert Luthuli, Nelson Mandela and Jacob Zuma including current president, Cyril Ramaphosa. Statues of former ANC Presidents situated on Durban’s M4 Ruth First Highway are attracting curious onlookers and begging a few questions. But the inclusion of two female stalwarts, Albertina Sisulu and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, has raised some eyebrows. The ANC is preparing for this weekend’s January 8th Statement at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Political Analyst Lukhona Mnguni says he fears the female inclusion was a mere after-thought. “They are postured as if someone said they are going to walk into a Generations set. What is worrying about the women – they are an after-thought. It would probably have been better if they had just left it as a garden of presidents and not sort of said oh by the way we need to pepper it a bit with a few women and then position Albertina Sisulu and Mam Winnie Madikizela-Mandela there at the back.” Watch the video below for more:
