Police Minister Bheki Cele has condemned the attack on police officers in two separate incidents in the Free State and the Western Cape, calling them senseless. Two people, including a police officer were killed and one seriously wounded during a shoot-out in Koffiefontein in southern Free State. It is believed that police received information on a suspected stolen vehicle. In the Western Cape, two police constables were attacked while following-up on an illegal firearm at a shack in the Siyangena informal settlement. A suspect opened fire, wounding the officers before turning the gun on his girlfriend and then himself. Cele’s spokesperson Reneilwe Serero says: “The Minister wishes a speedy recovery to our three members injured on duty and passes his deepest condolences to friends, colleagues and family of the slain police officer.” “The safety of our men and women in blue will and continue to remain a priority in the SAPS top management and the Ministry of Police. Police officers are an asset and they too need to be protected by all of us, including community members.”
