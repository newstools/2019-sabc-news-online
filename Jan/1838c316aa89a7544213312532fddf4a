Former Boston Advanced Software Agency (Bosasa) COO Angelo Agrizzi is back on the witness stand Friday morning at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Agrizzi’s testimony was brought to a halt on Thursday following security concerns. He had earlier raised security concerns to the commission after a former police officer Solomon Segale, who used to work for Bosasa, was spotted in the building with an expired police badge. Agrizzi told the commission that almost all of the company’s contracts with government were obtained illegally. He states that in instances where contracts were legitimately obtained, bribes were also paid. “I can’t count all the contracts at the back of my head but what I can tell you that, it was every single contract. Either way every single contract was tainted with bribes and corruption,” explains Agrizzi. He has disclosed to the commission of inquiry into state capture how on several occasions influence was exercised in awarding of government tenders. Agrizzi told the commission of a system used by the company to pay monthly bribes to trap officials. “You don’t entrap somebody for life when you pay them once off because they take their money and they go. They start and they do something else but once you start paying people and I’ve realised it myself the hard way. Once you start paying people bribes on a monthly basis for as long as they are there you control them 100%,” says Agrizzi. The facility and management company is believed to have been granted more than R10 billion in government tenders. With Agrizzi telling the commission that it spent more almost R6 million per month in bribes. More on story below:
