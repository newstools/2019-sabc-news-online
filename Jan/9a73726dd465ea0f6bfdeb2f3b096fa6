Residents of Sebokeng in the Emfuleni Municipality South of Johannesburg are still trying to repair their homes following flooding due to rain which started at the weekend. At least 70 houses have been affected with extensive damage cause to walls, roofs and roads. Emergency services have been placed on high alert as more rain is expected across the country for the rest of this week. In Gauteng there is between a 60 and an 80 per cent chance of rainfall. The provincial government and church groups are assisting the affected families. Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza says they have been trying to establish the needs of the affected families. “We are informed that there are eight families that are just in need of clothes, mattresses, food and other basic needs. We will be, you know, giving those eight households the food that they need, the mattresses that they need. Together we have contributed that to the families,” says Mayathula-Khoza. These Sebokeng residents say their lives are yet to get back to normal. “The house is ruined, everything is ruined. My children’s uniforms are gone and I just bought them on Saturday. I’m not happy and the Emfuleni Municipality isn’t helpful,” says a resident. “Yes, there’s food but I’m waiting for assistance in rebuilding my wall and fix my yard,” adds another. “I haven’t been ok since the flood but the damaged wall is stressing me.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
