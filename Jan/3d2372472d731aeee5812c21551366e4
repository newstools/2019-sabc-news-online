The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has condemned the escalation of attacks on its members by alleged striking AMCU members in Carletonville, west of Johannesburg. Since the strike started at Sibanye-Stillwater gold mine in November last year, 15 houses and 6 vehicles have reportedly been burnt at the Blybank Township in Carletonville. AMCU employees embarked on strike after a deadlock in negotiations over workers’ wages and safety investment. “We can confirm on record that since the AMCU strike started last year November, there have been killings and attacks on our members. As we speak at Blybank Township in Carletonville, 15 houses and 6 cars belonging to our members have been burnt since the strike started and as the NUM the law enforcement agencies don’t seem to do anything to arrest the perpetrators,” says Livhuwani Mammburu who is the NUM National Spokesperson.
