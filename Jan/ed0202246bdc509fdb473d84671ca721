Police and court officials have compiled a list of assets of KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) deputy chairperson and former Economic Development,Tourism and Enviromental Affairs MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu. This is in preparation of an envisaged court application to seize the assets which are suspected to have been acquired using the proceeds of crime. Mabuyakhulu and eight other business people are facing charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering in connection with the North Sea Jazz Festival which did not take place in Durban in 2012. The officials arrived at Mabuyakhulu’s home in Empangeni early on Thursday morning. “Police officers have spoken to SABC News as they were leaving the home of former MEC – Mike Mabuyakhulu. They say they were assessing what assets could be seized in a future operation. Justice and law enforcement agencies want to recover R28 million that was spent on the planned North Sea Jazz Festival in 2012. The festival never took place. The state alleges that business people who were awarded a tender to hold the festival, immediately started to launder the money they were paid. In turn, Mabuyakhulu allegedly received a R300 000 kickback.” CLICK VIDEO BELOW:
