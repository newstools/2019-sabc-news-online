Agrizzi is continuing to give his testimony at the commission into state capture currently underway in Parktown in Johannesurg.

He has singled out Bosasa chief accountant, Carlos Bonafacio, as one of those responsible for drawing up some of the fake invoices. Livestream of Agrizziâ€™s testimony below:
