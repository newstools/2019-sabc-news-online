The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) General Secretary, Bheki Ntshalintshali, has appealed to the African National Congress (ANC) leadership to retain all the education MECs who have done well in the 2018 matric results. Gauteng was the top performing province with 87.9% of candidates passing their finals. It is followed closely by the Free State. Ntshalintshali was speaking in Soweto during the 24th anniversary ceremony marking the passing of former national chairperson of the SACP, Joe Slovo. “Those MECs who have done well in Education please comrades don’t remove them and dump them at a national level.”
