The African National Congress (ANC) says it has learnt with sadness of the passing of former United Nations ambassador Dumisani Khumalo. The party says Khumalo died peacefully at his home. He was 71-years-old. The governing party says Khumalo distinguished himself as a top international diplomat and furthered the African agenda on the world stage. The ANC says Khumalo also played a crucial role in furthering South Africaâ€™s policy of global multilateralism and he will be sorely missed.
