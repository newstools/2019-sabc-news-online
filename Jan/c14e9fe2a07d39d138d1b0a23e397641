Learners from Prinshof School for the Blind and Partially Sighted, who are among the top performers in the country, attribute their success to proper planning, hard work, discipline and believing in themselves. 17-year-old Mongezi S’bongasonke Mbatha and 18 year-old Izak Rohan Crafford received an award presented by Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, when she announced the results on Thursday. Crafford outlines his plans in the new year following star performance that earned him a bursary of R50.000 for the duration of his study, a laptop and R7000 cash prize money. Crafford has achieved four distinctions out of seven subjects he had registered for. He says the success involved a lot of hard work. “Yes I was working hard. I have to say the work is rather easy. Well I find it easy, not all people do of course, but I didn’t find the work very challenging and of course summarising the work that we do. Constant studying so that the contents doesn’t leave one’s mind and devoted work. Really doing one’s best and doing what one should in order top achieve. No slacking.” Meanwhile, Prinshof School for the Blind and Partially Sighted principal, Karin Swart, says due attention is paid to individual learners because they are a specialised school. “I think the success of Prinshof school is each learner is treated individually. We are specialising in education and we have to have a lot of one on one time with learners and that makes the difference. If we have teachers that are specialising. We teachers that are very very equipped to teach learners in Braille and the partially sighted.” Mbatha and Crafford are part of the almost 800 000 learners who wrote final examinations at the end of last year.
