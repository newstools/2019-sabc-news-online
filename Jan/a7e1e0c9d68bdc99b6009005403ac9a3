National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) senior prosecutor Advocate Jan Ferreira stuck to his guns for a second day at the Mokgoro Enquiry. Ferreira insisted that the NPA had enough evidence to prosecute former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. Corruption charges against Mdluli were controversially withdrawn by Advocate Lawrance Mrwebi, the Special Director of Public Prosecution. The Mokgoro Enquiry is investigating the fitness to hold office of Mrwebi and senior Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba. Under cross examination, Advocate Jan Ferreira maintained that Richard Mduli was possibly being protected from prosecution. Ferreira further testified that Mrwebi had no authority to withdraw the charges against Mdluli. However, Mrwebi’s legal team argued that the case was not properly investigated, hence it had to be withdrawn. Meanwhile, the NPA came under sharp criticism for failing to provide the Enquiry with its final decision on whether or not it would reinstate perjury and fraud charges against Jiba. Jiba’s legal representative Thabani Masuku says:”We are still waiting for the acting NPA head Dr Silas Raimate to provide clarity. Lack of cooperation from the NPA compromises the work of the Enquiry.” The Enquiry will resume on Tuesday. Mrwebi is expected to take the stand. Click video below:
