The African National Congress (ANC) believes its decision to hold three major events in KwaZulu-Natal will help unite, heal wounds and strengthen the party.  The three events include National List conference, the January 8 statement and ANC Manifesto launch. The province is still reeling from crippling political killings and factionalism. Africa’s oldest liberation movement which was formed in 1912 and its founding president was John Langalibalele Dube who hailed from Inanda north of Durban. In 2019 birthday celebrations will be held in a province which is also the ANC’s biggest base.  The events will take place as the country prepares for its crucial 6th general elections.  KwaZulu-Natal alone boasts 6.6 million eligible voters. The ANC’s birthday rotates among provinces. In 2018 was Northern Cape’s turn but is surprisingly now in KwaZulu-Natal.  However the province continues to be plagued by deep divisions. KZN ANC Spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu says, ” the starting point was for leaders in the province of KwaZulu-Natal to accept that the divisions and the factions that are there in the province are not assisting the ANC.” One analyst believes President Cyril Ramaphosa wants to use the occasion to stamp his authority. University of KwaZulu-Natal’s  Imraan Buccus says, “We have to bear in mind that there are various dynamics within the ANC. On the one hand, Ramaphosa has set out on his austerity mission anti-corruption mission and this has marginalised large numbers of people in the ANC who are in a sense out of business.” Rifts widened in the run up to the ANC’s national elective conference in 2017 – with provincial leaders backing minister in the presidency, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Now with the national general elections just a few months away, will the party portray a united front?  Click video below:
