The search continues for two more bodies of teens presumed to have drowned in Portuguese Islands in Mozambique on Sunday. The body of one of the four South African holiday-makers, who drowned, was recovered on Thursday. On Friday morning a female body was discovered as well. Gregory Mpfune’s body was washed ashore on Thursday afternoon. The four, who are from Groblersdal in Limpopo, drowned on Sunday. A brother of one of the victims, Kabelo Matsepe, says there has been consulate assistance. “I have called the High Commissioner to assist especially families that can’t get to Mozambique. He however cited budgetary constraints and that the only assistance they can offer is consulate assistance.” This is despite Mozambican authorities asking for help from SA authorities, he adds. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has sent messages of condolences to the affected families. Mathabatha’s spokesperson Kenny Mathivha says the office of the premier is working with the South African embassy and the Mozambican navy to try and locate the four missing holiday makers. Meanwhile, the Department of International Relations and Co-Operation has been working with the Limpopo provincial government to assist family members who have travelled to Mozambique. Department spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mabaya, says South Africa’s High Commissioner in Mozambique has been liaising with the families.  Watch Video Below :
