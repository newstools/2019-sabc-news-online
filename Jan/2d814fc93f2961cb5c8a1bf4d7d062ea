Poland could consider a ban on the use of Huawei products by public bodies and possible legislation to curtail their use by private citizens, following the arrest of a Chinese Huawei official in Poland. Poland arrested a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegation – a move that could fuel Western security concerns about the telecoms equipment maker. According to a government official who is responsible for cyber security, abrupt policy changes towards Huawei were not warranted after the arrests. However, he said the use of the company’s products by state entities could be reviewed. “We will analyse whether … our decision can include an end to the use … of Huawei products,” says Karol Okonski.
