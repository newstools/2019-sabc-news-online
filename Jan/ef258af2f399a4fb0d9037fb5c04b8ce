The African National Congress (ANC) will brief the media on Tuesday on the outcomes of its two-day Lekgotla which ended on Monday in Irene outside Pretoria. The bi-annual meeting was preceded by the normal meeting of the party’s National Executive Committee. Both gatherings were called to discuss the ANC’s plan of action for the next year and practical ways to implement its 2019 election manifesto in the next five years. The ANC Lekgotla is a bi-annual meeting called to identify government priorities requiring attention and to guide the work of those deployed in government. It started with a political overview by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Issues up for discussion included ways to implement the party’s election manifesto with a specific focus on getting everyone to support its 2017 resolution to nationalise the Reserve Bank as well as building the state capacity in order to achieve a developmental state. The outcomes of the ANC Lekgotla will set the tone for discussion at the Cabinet Lekgotla scheduled for later this month with its outcomes forming the basis of the president’s State of the Nation Address.
