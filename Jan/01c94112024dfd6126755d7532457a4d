Global Technology Systems (GTS) employee Richard Le Roux says he was threatened several times on the phone by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. GTS is a subsidiary of the Bosasa Group. Le Roux is testifying at the told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture under way in Parktown, Johannesburg. Le Roux says that in 2017, Watson called him and asked where his loyalties lie following a Facebook comment he made on former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi’s post. He says he told Watson that his loyalties lie with the company. Le Roux, who has been residing at the Bosasa office park since 2012, told the Commission that he would often be called and instructed to conduct unlawful acts in the name of Bosasa. “At exactly 18:18, Chair Gavin Watson called me and instructed me to go to Lindsay Watson first thing in the morning and go do an affidavit saying that Angelo Agrizzi had instructed me to do the special projects that had be done thus far – that everything was done under his instructions.”
