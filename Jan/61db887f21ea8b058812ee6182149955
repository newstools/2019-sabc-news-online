The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has refuted reports that its Board has suspended the retrenchment process. The broadcaster was responding to an article that appeared in a daily newspaper on Monday morning. Late last year the SABC temporarily suspended the process after its board was left inquorate. “What we’ve noted is that the Business Day carried an inaccurate headline this (Monday) morning claiming that the SABC Board has suspended the Section 189 process. That is not in fact, the case precisely because the SABC board since the resignation of the four board members at the end of last year made this board inquorate and therefore this board could not have met to make this decision,” says SABC spokesperson, Neo Momodu. Read the full Statement: MEDIA STATEMENT SABC CLARIFIES HEADLINE ON SECTION 189 PROCESS Johannesburg – Monday, 21 January 2019 – The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has noted with concern the inaccurate headline in the Business Day newspaper giving the impression that the SABC Board recently made a pronouncement to suspend the section 189 of the LRA process. This is misleading as the resignations of the four Board members in November 2018 rendered the current Board inquorate and unable to meet to take decisions.  The SABC Board has therefore not met since it became inquorate in November 2018. The SABC would like to reiterate and reaffirm what management communicated to staff and  Organised Labour at the end of 2018 and that is, the envisaged process in terms of section 189 of the LRA has been held in abeyance until further notice. This is still the case and to date no decision to the contrary has been made. The SABC continues to engage relevant stakeholders on various matters affecting the Corporation and management is working to find solutions for the benefit of the SABC, its employees and the South African public.
