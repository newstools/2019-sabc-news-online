The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has vowed to attend to concerns raised by the leadership of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) led by Mzwanele Nyontsho within a week. The PAC leadership met with IEC commissioners on Thursday to request recognition status. Nyontsho and members of his national executive committee accused the commission of refusing to recognise them as the legitimate leadership of the PAC. IEC Chief Sy Mamabolo says they had a fruitful meeting. The party has called off its planned countrywide protests at IEC voter registration centres this weekend. The party’s leaders had threatened to disrupt the weekend voter registration drive, accusing the Election Commission of not recognising them as the legitimate leadership. The PAC is sharply divided with another faction led by Narius Moloto claiming legitimacy. Party Secretary-General Apa Pooe says they have called off their action pending a decision by the IEC next week. Click below for  related stories:
