North West Education MEC, Sello Lehari, says there’s a possibility that other teachers might be suspended at Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke. He says apart from the suspended teacher, Elana Barkhuizen, who took the photograph of black and white Grade R learners sitting separately, action should also be taken against the teacher who separated the learners in the classroom. Lehari says action should also be taken against the principal for misleading the department about who actually took the picture. He says, “You cannot have a case of this magnitude and there’s no action against somebody. If the first one who is suspended by the SGB and her role was just to take the pictures, who separated learners.” “So following the procedure, he or she will be suspended.” Related video:
