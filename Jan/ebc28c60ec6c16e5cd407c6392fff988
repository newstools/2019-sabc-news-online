The 24-year-old woman who is accused of killing her four children in Klarinet at Emalahleni in Mpumalanga is expected to appear in court on Wednesday. She was arrested after she told her family members and neighbours to go and check at her house on Sunday. Police say bodies of the children aged between 11 months and eight years were found wrapped in blankets inside her house. Mpumalanga police spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi, says the suspect is in hospital because she fell ill after she handed herself over on Sunday. “The woman whom it is alleged that she is responsible for the murder or death of her four children is expected to appear before the Witbank Magistrate’s Court. However, we have indicated that she was admitted at hospital therefore it means if she is still at the hospital she will appear in absentia. But if it happens that she is discharged from the hospital she will then appear in person,” says Hlathi.
