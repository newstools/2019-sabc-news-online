The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) has opened a case of crimen injuria against the man who verbally attacked one of their nurses at Tembisa Hospital in Ekurhuleni. This comes after the patient complained to the nurse about being displeased with the food the hospital was serving. It is said that he started insulting the nurse during visiting hours and further proceeded to hurl profanities at the nurse on Facebook. “We have opened a case of crimen injuria because he also took pictures of a nurse and after taking the pictures he put them on Facebook without telling the nurse that he took her pictures without her permission. We have taken the matter to the Civil Court on Monday because he insulted all Nurses in general, he said all Nurses are stupid,” says Denosa’s Regional Secretary, Lebo Khumalo.
