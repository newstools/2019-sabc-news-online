The Western Cape Agriculture Department has availed more than R8 million in drought support to more than 580 farmers in the Central Karoo. The farmers have been battling severe drought conditions for several years. Last week, provincial Agriculture Minister, Beverly Schafer, visited farms in Laingsburg which is currently in the fourth year of the drought. The department has been providing support to small-scale and commercial farmers in the form of vouchers for fodder. Schafer says farmers are reliant on government support. “The farmers I met with had various ideas for ways that farmers in the region can be supported and assisted and we will be investigating how best to do this. During my visit on Friday I saw first-hand how the grass and plants which ordinarily provides grazing to sheep has died out. Farmers are reliant on the fodder support which they receive from the department as well as many donations.” Watch related video:
