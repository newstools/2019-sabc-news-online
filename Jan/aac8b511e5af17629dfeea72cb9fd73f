African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has reassured professionals that the ANC understands their aspirations and will act on them. He made the assurance in his address to hundreds of professionals in Durban on Wednesday night ahead of the launch of the ANC’s election manifesto on Saturday. The party’s loss of support in the major metros in the 2016 local government elections has been attributed to the disgruntled middle class – many of them professionals – with the ruling party and its policies. Ramaphosa, who was flanked by KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson Sihle Zikalala, answered questions from the professionals. “We are pleased that you are articulating the views of people on the ground and we are going to be heeding those views be they issues of employment equity, be they issues of funding for businesses, be they issues of empowerment for young people who should get into business, businesses all those issues are top of mind for us.” Click on video below:
