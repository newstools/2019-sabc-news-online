The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State has described the death of its former mayor of the Masilonyana Local Municipality, Nontsizi Matjhana, as a great loss. Matjhana died on Saturday after a long illness. She was elected mayor of the municipality after it was placed under administration following municipal elections in 2016. The ANC removed Matjhana from the position of mayor last year, because of ill-health. ANC’s provincial spokesperson Thabo Meeko says, “Indeed, we are saddened and it is a great loss to the African National Congress. At the time when the African National Congress was looking for young leaders. Comrade Ntsiki was identified as one of those with a potential and talent, and was deployed as a mayor of Masilonyana local municipality. So indeed, the ANC is paralysed without her, and it is a great loss”. Meanwhile, Free State Co-operate Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Aupa Khoabane has described Matjhana, as a hardworking person. Khoabane says Matjhana always had the interest of the people at heart. “Your former councillor Nontsizi was energetic young person, who was willing to learn. She would be very passionate about projects that are meant to assist and turn the lives of the people around. She would always ask about agricultural projects that are helpful to people, especially young people,” says Khoabane.
