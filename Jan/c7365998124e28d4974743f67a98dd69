The Commission of Inquiry into allegations of impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) is expected to hear evidence from senior employees today before it adjourns for a break. This week damning evidence emerged from the head of Naledi Advisory Services, Frans Lekubo and former Board member Claudia Manning. Lekubo explained how the PIC’s head of IT filed corruption charges against its CEO Dan Matjila. Manning shed light on how dysfunctional the Board was in the period between September to December 2017. She added that former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba stopped the PIC from functioning over a period of more than two months. Manning says it also became impossible to meet regularly because of Cabinet reshuffles. The Commission is yet to shed light on reports that the CEO allegedly showed favouritism towards certain staff, victimised and awarded bonuses to certain people. So far former Board member Claudia Manning has denied that the Board ignored or tried to cover up the CEO’s allegations of impropriety and corruption. On September 2017, members of the Board were sent a series of e mails from an alias named James Nogu- which outlined allegations about the CEO violating the PIC policies by providing funding to his alleged girlfriend. The Board remained divided on the way forward regarding this issue and tensions started to arise.
