The Black Management Forum (BMF) says it has written a letter to Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to establish whether there was no black person who could have filled the position of group chief executive of arms manufacturer Denel. This after cabinet approved the appointment of Daniel du Toit to the position with effect from January the 14th, 2019. Du Toit recently vacated a position as managing director at SAAB Medav Technologies in Germany.  Prior to that he was chief operating officer of SAAB Grintech Defence in South Africa, where he served in several senior management positions. Du Toit began his career in the South African National Defense Force. BMF deputy president, Tasmin Fredricks says they are seeking specific information. “Well, ultimately, we’d like to see why there wasn’t a suitably black person appointed in the position, and I’m sure that there are suitable black professionals who can fill the position, and that that appointment be set aside. That is the information that we don’t have at hand, and this is why we are requesting this information from Denel. We’re constantly finding public institutions making the excuse that there’s never a suitably black professional that can fill the position.”
