The murder case against 40 year-old Soweto born rapper Thulani Ngcobo, popularly known as Pitch Black Afro, is expected to resume Friday morning at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. Ngcobo has been charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice after allegedly killing his wife Catherine Modisane on the 31st of December at a Bed and Breakfast establishment in Yeoville, Johannesburg. Pitch Black Afro is expected to make his third appearance in the dock this Friday morning after spending more than a week behind bars.  At his previous appearance on Tuesday, the matter was postponed to allow the state time to verify with Ngcobo’s aunt, whether she will allow him to live with her should he be granted bail. Ngcobo is expected to make his formal bail application on Friday. It’s understood that on the 31st of December police believed that Catherine Modisane died of natural causes, however a few days later a murder docket was opened after foul play was suspected.
