ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged young leaders to follow the legacy of the late African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) President Peter Mokaba. Ramaphosa was addressing a rally of young people in Durban, in celebration of what would have been Mokaba’s 60th birthday. He has praised the ANC Youth League for taking on calls for free education and the expropriation of land without compensation. Ramaphosa says Mokaba was never afraid to hold leaders accountable. “We must ask ourselves, what would Peter Mokaba have said if he were around today? About what is happening, but more particularly about the ANC Youth League today? Peter Mokaba was not afraid to raise concerns about the state of the movement. He was not afraid to raise concerns about the conduct of leaders. As he saw leaders of the movement veering off at a tangent he was among the first to raise issues.” Meanwhile, Ramaphosa and his Zambian counterpart Edgar Lungu have warned electoral officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo to release the results of December’s vote soon in order to avoid suspicion and instability over the outcome. The two leaders held emergency talks in Durban as the release of the results was further delayed. Click below for more on the story:
