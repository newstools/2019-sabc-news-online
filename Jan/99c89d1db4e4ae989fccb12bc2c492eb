The South African Communist Party (SACP) will be calling for protests outside the US embassy in support of the people of Venezuela. The President of the SACP Solly Mapaila says his party has mobilised other trade unions and organisations to join them. “The world should reject this unilateralism of the US government, we should also stand up particularly through the United Nations to sustain and defend the independence of autonomy of countries, in this case Venezuela, to practise the social system that they saw fit for their country.” Meanwhile, Labour federation Saftu is calling on the world to support the country’s democratic leader, President Nicolas Maduro. Saftu says Venezuela can resolve the political impasse. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu has described the situation in Venezuela, as unlawful and unconstitutional. He says President Donald Trump is supporting a coup d’état in that country after opposition leader Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself as an interim leader. “If there are objections in elections in Venezuela, they must exhaust all constitutional processes, they must go to the courts and challenge all the elections instead of ushering in a coup d’état, where a president of the national assembly has just declared himself a president without a popular mandate of the people.”
