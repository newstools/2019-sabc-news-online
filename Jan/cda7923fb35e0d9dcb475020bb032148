Prophet Shepherd Bushiri‘s Enlightened Christian Gathering church in Pretoria has rejected the City of Tshwane’s finding that it’s non-compliant in terms of health and safety standards. This comes after an inspection by the city’s emergency services department. The inspection follows the tragic death of three church congregants during a stampede on the 28th of last month. The city will now issue a compliance order which the church must adhere to within 30 days or cease all activities. The church’s attorney Terrence Baloyi is adamant that his client is compliant. “I have a copy of the compliance certificate issued by the city of Tshwane for the 31st of December 2018, authorising us to hold an event of the cross-over in the same venue. Other than that as far as JOC is concerned, every month we are issued by  certificate to say at the church are you complying with the bylaws of the city, and to confirm they issue us with a certificate, we have monthly certificates issued to us by the cot through this joint operation committee.” Related video:
