The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has raised concerns over the loss of qualified doctors to other countries due to the Health Department’s inability to provide them with jobs. SAMA says the loss of critical skills will prevent the department from reaching its ambition of sustainable development goals by 2030, which include recruiting and training health care professionals to curb epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria. SAMA board member Dr Edward Ngwenya says government should activate its job creation plans and include health professionals in the process. “The government must be honest in terms of, they’ve got so many ambitions but in reality they cannot actualise them. So number one, we must stop playing games, stop speaking and using euphemisms in order to appease. We must involve all role players. This cannot be a decision that’s made simply on political terms or political agenda. It must be pushed by professionals who are able to give you results.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/644691">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on videos below:
