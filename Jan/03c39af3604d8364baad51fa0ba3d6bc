A school principal has allegedly forced learners to strip half naked as punishment for not bringing calculators to school at the Ntwampe Technical High School in Sekhukhune. The community is demanding that the principal be fired. He has reportedly taken sick leave. Some of the affected grade ten learners say they are traumatised by the incident. “When we got to the principal’s office, he ordered us to take off our shirts and all girls to remove bras. We did as we were instructed. He then told us to stand in the sun half naked. Afterwards, we went back to his office, dressed and returned to class. I don’t think I will enjoy myself at this school anymore. I’m still shocked. I can’t believe he did this to us. He should be removed from the school,” says the student. Police have confirmed that a case of indecent assault has been opened against the principal. Spokesperson for the Limpopo Department of Education, Sam Makondo, says the matter is receiving attention. “The department has learned about the allegations and we do not by any stretch of imagination take this matter lightly. It is very, very serious and accordingly, warrants a thorough investigation in a manner that will see us taking appropriate action. We don’t want to miss anything in the process and we will at an appropriate time comment further. For now, we are encourage that teaching and learning at the school is going ahead,” says Makondo.
