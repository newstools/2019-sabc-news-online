Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on International Relations has expressed concern about the latest terror attacks in Kenya. Chairperson of the Committee, Siphosezwe Masango says the attacks pose a threat to the African continent. Masango says the only way to resolve differences is through dialogue. “Well, as a Committee on International Relations, we are deeply concerned about the continuous and continuing attacks by the al-Shabaab insurgents in Kenya. We feel that the African continent has been played … rather too long by acts of insurgency, terrorism, civil war and by many other acts that denied the African continent the conditions of peace and peace is the necessary condition for peace in the African continent.” The Democratic Alliance (DA) has also added its voice in condemning the terror attacks in Kenya describing the acts as barbaric. The party says the international community should work swiftly to ensure that those responsible for the attacks are brought to book. “We, as the Democratic Alliance, condemn the barbaric murder of the innocent civilians, which is believed to have been carried by the terrorist groups of al-Shabaab. We are in solidarity with the Kenyan people at this point in time and we condemn the act and we called on the international community under the auspices of the African Union, and also the united Security Council to ensure that those who are responsible are held accountable,” says DA’s Spokesperson on International Relations, Stevens Mokgalapa.
