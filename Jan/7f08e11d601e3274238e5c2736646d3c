Students from the University of Johannesburg (UJ) who applied for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) say the university still requires them to pay registration fees. This despite NSFAS saying students who qualify for funding need not pay. These students have expressed their frustration. “Yet I still had to pay for registration. Its super frustrating having to go through all these trials and tribulations to get this registration money just to secure a space at UJ.” “I’m being told that I should sign an AOD, then pay 50% of the amount I owe and it’s too much. We don’t have the money.” “I owe like R48 500 tuition fees so I can’t register. I was admitted. Now I have to register but I’m blocked. So I have to wait to be unblocked,” the students complained.
