Messages of condolences and the condemnation of the attacks in Kenya continue to pour in. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa and opposition parties, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters added their voice to the chorus of condemnation. In a statement, President Ramaphosa extended South Africa’s condolences to the bereaved and wished those injured a speedy recovery. No South African citizen has been reported injured in the attack. The High Commission in Nairobi is monitoring the situation and communicating with authorities. The President also sent a message of support to the government and the people of Kenya. The DA added its voice, describing the attacks as barbaric. The party’s called on the AU and international community to ensure that those responsible are held accountable. Kenya has often been targeted by militant group al-Shabaab, which killed dozens of people in a shopping centre in 2013 and nearly 150 students at a university in 2015. The EFF has labelled the attacks cowardly, saying nothing justifies the killing of innocent people. The party is also calling on the AU to intervene with military action against terrorists before they kill more people. Al-Shabaab says its attacks in Kenya are revenge for Kenyan troops stationed inside Somalia, torn apart by civil war since 1991. Kenyan troops originally went into Somalia to create a buffer zone along the border. They are now part of an AU peacekeeping force, supporting the weak UN-backed central government.
