Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, has revealed that a monthly cash payment of  R300 000 was made to the Jacob G Zuma foundation, and was received by its Chairperson, Dudu Myeni. Agrizzi is continuing with his testimony before the commission of inquiry into state capture, under way in Parktown in Johannesburg. He says that he knew about the payment because he had to pack the money, and would be present on certain occasions when the money would be handed over. Agrizzi says what struck him was that the payments to the foundation were always in cash. Meanwhile, Agrizzi also told the commission that Bosasa hired media consultants at a total price tag of R1 million to deal with the company’s negative publicity. Agrizzi says the two consultants; Benedicta Dube and Stephen Laufer were hired to get rid of negative reporting about Bosasa and to discredit some journalist.   Watch video below:
