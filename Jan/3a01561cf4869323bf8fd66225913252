Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has warned of the risk of the SABC not having a fully functional board – saying it will impact negatively on election coverage. The Portfolio Committee on Communications says it will prioritise focusing on the selection of eight new non-executive SABC board members. Nominations closed in December. Scopa chairperson, Themba Godi, says operations will resume early this year to try to ensure there is a fully functional board in the run up to this year’s general elections. “The risk is huge for the elections because there is no other media institution that covers the country’s elections equally to the SABC. It’s going to be problematic and the ability to give a full spectrum coverage might impact on parties in terms of the SABC having properly planned and having the requisite capacity to cover everybody in all corners of the country,” adds Click on video below:  Godi.
