The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) management has resolved the issue of salary payments. Workers at the public broadcaster were not paid their January salary on time due to a technical glitch on Tuesday morning. This caused panic with employees thinking the institution had reached the much-dreaded Day Zero that the Board warned about last year. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu says all employees have now been paid. “The financial institution has since resolved the technical error and salaries are being paid. SABC would like to thank its employees for their patience, support and apologises for any inconvenience caused while we were addressing the matter with the financial institution.”   Watch related video below for more on the story:
