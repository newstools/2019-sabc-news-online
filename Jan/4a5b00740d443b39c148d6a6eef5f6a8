Former Bosasa CFO Andries Van Tonder will on Wednesday continue with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Van Tonder’s testimony began on Tuesday afternoon, following the conclusion of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi, who spent nine days on the stand. During his testimony Agrizzi revealed information implicating politicians and journalists and admitted to being a racist. Van Tonder  told the commission he was told by his former boss Gavin Watson not to worry as he was connected with high-ranking officials in government and added that he was too scared of Watson because of these connections. “I was fearful of Gavin Watson and I am still fearful of Gavin Watson. Gavin Watson is connected to very powerful people right up to the highest level in government and many of those people actually visited the Bosasa head office…” said Van Tonder. He added: “He used these people to do his corruption, unlawful actions for him on his behalf and then he would just dispose of them after they served their purpose.” WATCH
