Baby Daniel’s mother will find out on Friday if the High Court in Johannesburg will release her on bail pending her sentencing on two counts of child abuse and neglect. Three year-old Baby Daniel died from the injuries he suffered  after been held under boiling bath water at his home in Naturena, south of Johannesburg, in 2016. His mother Marike Vermaak and her boyfriend Tim Naidoo were convicted for their roles in the baby’s death. Vermaak’s lawyer has argued that keeping her in prison would prejudice her and her other surviving three children. The state is opposing bail.
