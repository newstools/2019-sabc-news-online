The Democratic Alliance (DA) will be approaching the United Nations Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court to seek intervention on the human rights crisis gripping Zimbabwe. The party announced this during a press briefing in Johannesburg attended by a number of MPs and members of Zimbabwe‘s opposition MDC-Alliance party. DA leader Musi Maimane says South Africa should use its non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2019 to advance human rights but added that the African National Congress (ANC) cannot be trusted to do this. “Our record of voting in the UN Security Council does not side with human rights, it sides with dictators.” “The ANC cannot be trusted to side with the people of Zimbabwe that’s why we are going to international bodies, SADC is a brotherhood of big brothers they believe in the rule of man not the rule of law.” Related video click below:
