Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Labour has agreed to effect a technical amendment to the National Minimum Wage Act that came into effect at the beginning of 2019. This will fix an error that occurred during drafting where wrong references were made in the short title and date of commencement. Committee Chairperson Lemias Mashile says this does not affect the implementation of the act that commenced on 1 January. He says workers should be conscious that employers pay them accordingly. “They are the people that would see whether the minimum wage is being implemented or not because they will see in their hands in their pay pocket. Those that they were earning less than R3 500 last year then if in January then it is still the same amount, then that means the minimum wage has not been implemented. They must report to the CCMA or report to their unions which must report to the CCMA or take the matter straight to court.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
