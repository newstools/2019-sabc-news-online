Corruption Watch is calling on the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to consider releasing interim reports, and not wait for the end of its term to inform the public of its findings. The commission is due to sit for at least two years. Former BOSASA chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi is elaborating how the facility and management company spent almost R6 million a month on bribes. He has resumed testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Agrizzi volunteered to give evidence to the commission where is expected to implicate himself and 38 high ranking government officials. He worked for BOSASA for almost 20 years. Corruption Watch Executive Director, David Lewis says releasing interim reports will help keep the public interested in the proceedings. “I think if the public have to wait two and a half years for a report of several thousand pages, they are not going to be taken with. And there is no reason why the commission should do that, as that will allow action to be taken were its appropriate earlier, but it also keeps the public engaged and I think that is really the vital consideration. In any public policy initiative you need to keep the public informed and with you and interested.” Click on audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/644867">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on video below:
