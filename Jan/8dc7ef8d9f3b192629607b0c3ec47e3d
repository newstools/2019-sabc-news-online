Comair has confirmed that it has been unable to agree on a way forward with Numsa with regard to the salary discrepancy dispute. Executive Director of Comair’s Airline Division Wrenelle Stander, says that Numsa’s claim that Comair personnel are paid R7 000 a month more than their colleagues on the basis of race is factually incorrect. The company says salary discrepancies of the 21 affected employees range upward from R600 and in the instance of one employee R 7 900. These discrepancies arose as a result of evolving airport operations, when some salary scales were collapsed, going back as far as 2009. Numsa is demanding a wage increase of 12%, a guaranteed 13th cheque, travelling allowance and a daily overtime allowance.
