Judgment in the bail application of the man accused of killing seven family members in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, will be handed down next week in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto. Sixty-one-year old Fitha Khupe stands accused of the murders of seven Khoza family members in October 2018. Khupe, together with his co-accused Vusi Ernest Mabaso, who died in police custody in Cape Town last week, face seven counts of murder. Khupe will have to spend another six days behind bars, before Magistrate David Mohango makes a ruling on his application for bail on the 4th of February. In his closing arguments, state prosecutor Tumelo Maunye opposed Khupe’s bail application, saying it would not be in the interest of the justice for Khupe to be released on bail. The prosecutor went on to state that Khupe is a flight risk, as he is not a South African citizen, and may flee to his birth country of Mozambique. Earlier, Khupe’s attorney Gerhard Landman told the court that his client maintains his innocence and that he was not involved in the gruesome murders in any way. Click video below:
