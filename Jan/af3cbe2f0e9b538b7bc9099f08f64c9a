The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it will be back at the Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke in the North West on Monday. This comes after a picture emerged on social media depicting black and white Grade R learners divided by race in a classroom. North West Education MEC, Sello Lehare has since suspended Ellen Barkhuisen, the teacher at the school who is implicated in the matter pending investigations. Advocate Andre Gaum is the SAHRC Commissioner responsible for education. “The Provincial Department of Education will also establish a task team to deal with transformation in particular at the school. It has invited the commission to participate in this team, which we will indeed do as a commission to try and see how we can take the investigation forward. On Thursday, when we were there, we could not really go forward with the investigation because of the total destruction that was taking place,” says Gaum. Lessons are expected to resume at Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke in the North West on Monday. Watch a related video below:
