The Chairman of Huawei, Liang Hua, said on Tuesday the company would allow foreign officials to visit its labs as the Chinese company faces suspicion from Western countries that its telecoms equipment could be used for espionage. Liang told reporters at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos that Huawei followed the laws of countries where it operates. If requested, it was ready to welcome foreign officials and let them see its facilities and business processes, he said. He said the company was seeking a quick conclusion of the case of its executive, Meng Wanzhou, arrested in Canada on 01 December 2018 on an extradition request from the United States (US) over US accusations of sanctions busting that Huawei denies. Huawei will call for a quick resolution of the case regarding its detained executive in Canada who is accused of violating US sanctions on Iran, Liang Hua said on Tuesday. Liang, who was appointed acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Huawei in December following the arrest of the companyâ€™s CFO at the request of the United States, was speaking to media on the sidelines of the WEF in Davos. She was released on bail in December and is due in court in Vancouver on 6 February.
