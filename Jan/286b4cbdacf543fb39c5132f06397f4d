The National Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries says the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Limpopo is a crisis because the country has to halt the export of cloven hoofs animals such as cattle, pig and goats. The foot and mouth disease has been detected in cattle at Sundani village, in the Vhembe District Municipality. Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Botlhe Modisane says the country has lost its status as a foot-and-mouth disease-free zone. “Losing status for foot-and-mouth disease zone freedom, we had to notify our trading partners, the international community of the disease. Until we have determined the extent of the spread, we are not able to export. It is such a big crisis because we now have to stop all exports of cloven hooves animals probably and their products.”
