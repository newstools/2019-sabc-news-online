Democratic Republic of Congo M17 party Vice President Kuku Itambo says African leaders should find a political solution to help resolve the impasse in the DRC. Itambo has warned that failure to do that – the will be trouble in the DRC as people are not willing to accept the latest election results. She has accused Joseph Kabila of vote rigging and adds that this time – they will not sit back and watch history repeat itself. Reports of irregularities in the election process have made it hard for locals to find the announced results reliable. Martin Fayulu, who came second but claims to be the real winner of the presidential race, has appealed to the country’s Constitutional Court to cancel the provisional result. Meanwhile, Itambo says she has engaged with the South African government to intervene and to help find lasting solutions – and she’s hopeful that the government will help resolve the impasse. The country’s provisional results released last week Thursday declared Tshisekedi the winner with 38.57% of the vote, just ahead of Fayulu with 34.8%. Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, the candidate backed by outgoing president Joseph Kabila, came a distant third with 23.8%.
