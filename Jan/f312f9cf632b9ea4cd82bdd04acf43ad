PAC president Mzwanele Nyontso wants the National Assembly to reinstate former PAC leader Luthando Mbinda as an MP with immediate effect, and to release the PAC’s constituency funding. Nyontso and his recently elected party leadership are meeting with the Office of the Speaker on Monday. The call comes as Mbinda and his rival former Narius Moloto prepare for a court battle with Mbinda challenging his dismissal from Parliament. Mbinda was removed by Moloto in September 2018 following a High Court ruling in Gauteng. This left the PAC without a representative in parliament and the party’s constituency funds frozen. Nyontso elaborates on the purpose of the meeting. “The purpose of the visit is one – to introduce the new leadership to Parliament, particularly to the office of the Speaker. And secondly – the purpose is to communicate with the speaker’s office, the NEC resolution that Parliament must re-instate former President Mbinda as a Member of Parliament with immediate effect, because the PAC has no representation and yet we have a seat. This thing is just killing the PAC and they must just sort it out and re-instate Mr Mbinda, and after that release PAC funding so that the PAC can service it’s constituencies.”
