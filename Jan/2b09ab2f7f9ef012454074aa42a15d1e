President of the African National congress (ANC) Veterans League, Snuki Zikalala, says the party is working hard to restore its dignity and integrity. This as the ruling party celebrates its 107th anniversary on Tuesday. Senior ANC members including President Cyril Ramaphosa and deputy president David Mabuza are travelling across KwaZulu-Natal and engaging with communities. Zikalala says the ANC must work hard to restore faith in communities across South Africa. “It was ten years of mismanagement where the rot crept. We did not stand up and say this is wrong, but fortunately, eventually we did stand up and say to our leadership this cannot go on forever, and we need to restore the dignity of the ANC. We have the authority to intervene and ensure that the credibility of the ANC is restored and bring back the integrity of the ANC”, says Zikalala. Zikalala says ANC members who are found to be involved in corrupt activities should not find themselves on the party’s list to be sent to Parliament.  Meanwhile, with just three days to go before the ANC launches its election manifesto, Ramaphosa urged commuters in Pinetown just outside Durban to attend the event scheduled to take place at Moses Mabhida Stadium. Ramaphosa says that the ANC manifesto is not just a call to the party faithful but to all citizens.
