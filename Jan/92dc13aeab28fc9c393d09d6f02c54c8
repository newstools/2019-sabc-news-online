Congress of People (COPE) has reacted with shock to a Sunday newspaper article, claiming that the controversial Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso, who is detained at St Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth, is receiving preferential treatment. According to the newspaper article, Omotoso is being held in a single cell, the designer suits that he wears at his trial are hanged on the wall and is able to preach to his congregants via a cell phone. Omotoso is on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court facing rape and human trafficking charges.  COPE’s spokesperson Dennis Bloem says this is unacceptable. “It is totally disgusting what we read in the newspaper about the special VIP treatment that Omotoso is receiving from prison authorities. This is unacceptable the Correctional Services Act is very clear how an awaiting trial detainee must be treated. There are certain rights that must be withheld it can’s be business as usual.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
