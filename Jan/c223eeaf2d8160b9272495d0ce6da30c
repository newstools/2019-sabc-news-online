Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has defended the DA’s election campaign poster. Maimane says its poster shows the struggles of the people of South Africa.  He continues to say that the names that appear on the posters were already on the public domain. Meanwhile the African National Congress (ANC) has dismissed the Democratic Alliance (DA) election billboard which has the words, “The ANC is Killing Us” as desperate, fear-mongering and insensitive to the victims of Life Esidimeni and Marikana tragedies. Maimane says the billboard is a memorial to those that died as a result of the African National Congress’s failures and a lack of care for people. But the governing party says this is clear demonstration that the DA is becoming insignificant on the country’s political landscape. ANC STATEMENT ON DA COMMENTS#GrowSoutAfrica pic.twitter.com/mUv7uAtkYQ — #GrowSouthAfrica #ThumaMina (@MYANC) January 17, 2019  The DA billboard which the party says serves to honour those that died as a result of the ANC’s failures and a lack of care for the people has drawn widespread criticism and caused outrage on social media. The billboard put up outside the Johannesburg CBD lists the names of all the victims of Marikana, Life Esidimeni and the children that have drowned in pit latrines. Some of the people tweeted claim that they are related to the people whose names are on the billboard and they were not told about the matter.  ANC acting spokesperson Dakota Legoete has labelled the DA’s move to put up the billboard as gutter politics. “What the DA is doing now is just to rub salts in the wounds of the families which are trying to heal out of this particular tragedy and as the ANC we will look at our options and where possible we will approach the electoral court because this is dirty campaigning.” Maimane’s interview ,Click video below:
