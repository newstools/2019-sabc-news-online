Hundreds of flights are to be cancelled at eight German airports, including at the nation’s busiest travel hub – Frankfurt, as security staff walk off the job in a deepening row over pay. Germany’s powerful Verdi union says the strike would affect several airports, including Frankfurt, Munich, Hanover, Bremen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Dresden and Erfurt. At least 220-thousand travellers will be hit by cancellations and delays, in a calculation that includes knock-on effects in other airports. Verdi, wants to see wages raised of workers carrying out passenger, freight, personnel and goods checks at all German airports.
