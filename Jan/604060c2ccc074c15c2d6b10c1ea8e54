A media delegation from South Africa is in India for that country’s 70th Republic Day Celebrations. This year is historic in that President Cyril Ramaphosa is the chief guest at the celebrations and this is symbolic of a new robust relationship between the two countries. Ramaphosa has landed in New Delhi on his first ever state visit to India. Apart from bilateral talks with the Indian Prime Minister, President Ramaphosa will also be the chief guest at India’s Republic Day military parade – only the second South African President after Nelson Mandela to get the honour.
