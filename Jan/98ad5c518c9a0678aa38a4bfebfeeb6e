There’s been a break-in at the Education Department’s Gauteng East district office in Springs east of Johannesburg. Robbers made off with computer equipment after accosting two security guards who were on duty last Friday. Nearly two weeks ago police recovered 22 out of the 185 stolen tablets, laptops and other equipment stolen from the state-of-the-art Menzi Primary school in Tsakane also on the east rand. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is outraged. “It is just unfortunate that now we are a clear target of criminals.  If it’s not schools it’s our offices,  if it’s not our offices – it’s our learners that are mugged.  We call upon law enforcement officers to protect us.  We really believe that education plays a very important role in society, and it can’t be left to chance.” Watch related video below:
