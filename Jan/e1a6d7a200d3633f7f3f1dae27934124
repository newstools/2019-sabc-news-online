Farmers have welcomed good rains that South Africa has received in the past few days. World Farmers Organisation chairperson Theo de Jager says the rain is a relief to both livestock and crop farmers after the heat wave. De Jager says it is still raining in some parts of Limpopo. There has been localised flooding in the Tzaneen and Thohoyandou areas. De Jager explains: “We had some wonderful rain over the last two-three days, this was after a dry spell in which especially the livestock farmers started to struggle, those in the communal areas, small family farmers with only few livestock really started to struggle. We have seen a loss of livestock and of course many of the farmers in the Limpopo province and the little wine land and their neighbouring state have now planted and this rain will bring a lot of relief.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
