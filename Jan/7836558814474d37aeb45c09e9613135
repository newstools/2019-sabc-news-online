China said on Monday it would welcome United Nations (UN) officials to visit its far western region of Xinjiang if they follow the proper procedures, amid global concern over Beijing’s de-radicalization programme there. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang made the comments at a regular briefing in Beijing. The top UN human rights official Michelle Bachelet, in December said her office was seeking access to Xinjiang to verify “worrying reports” of re-education camps holding Muslim minorities, including the Turkic speaking Uighurs.
