Home Affairs Minister, Siyabonga Cwele, has appealed to people who haven’t yet collected their identity documents to do so as soon as possible. He was briefing the media in Pretoria on the festive season’s travellers statistics and Home Affairs Department matters. Cwele says the majority of uncollected IDs are in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. “I appeal to those who have applied for their ID documents to come and collect them at our Home Affairs offices. We have about 300 000 documents which are uncollected. Most of them were applied for in 2018. Most of the uncollected IDs are from Gauteng, KZN, EC and WC – but it goes across all provinces. The largest numbers are in Gauteng, mainly in Soweto and northern PTA.” Click on video below:
