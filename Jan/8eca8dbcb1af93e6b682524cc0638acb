A former board member of the Public Investment Corporation, Claudia Manning, has described the PIC board as characterised by fear and divisions in the period from September to December 2017. Speaking at the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of impropriety at the Corporation, Manning said the board and management were devoting all their attention to managing the CEO’s crisis rather than focusing on the core business of the PIC. Manning is the fourth witness to testify at the Commission this week. She left the board in 2018 over the handling of investigations into the Corporation’s former CEO Daniel Matjila. “The board had been fractured really along a particular line around the issue of how to deal with the allegation, corruption against the CEO and although the majority decision was that the board accepted the bona fide’s of the CEO and expressed their unhappiness with how he dealt with the matter of the 300 thousand I believed that he has performed his duties in accordance with what our expectations were. So the view was that he should be allowed to continue his work.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
