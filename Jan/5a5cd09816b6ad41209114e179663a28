The EFF has called on the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, led by Justice Raymond Zondo, to protect former Bosasa CEO, Angelo Agrizzi following his damning testimony at the Commission. Party leader Julius Malema says the ANC has members who are not immune to causing disruptions and breaking the law. He told a media conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday that they’ll see to it that the Commission does its work with diligence and make sure those who give evidence are protected. Agrizzi implicated senior ANC members who are allegedly involved in corruption and enabling state capture – including NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane and MP Vincent Smith. Malema says, “We call upon heightened security and protection of Mr Agrizzi because some of the individuals he has implicated in testimony have a history of killing those who they disagree with as far back as in the MK camps in exile. Furthermore, we call on Nomvula Mokonyane, Gwede Mantashe, Baleka Mbete, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to all resign from both Parliament and Cabinet. In making the call, we place emphasis on Nomvula who has been swimming in a pool of scandals throughout her term as a Cabinet member.”
