The bail application of an African National Congress(ANC) councillor and two accused is expected to continue in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court south of Durban on Wednesday. Sibusiso Maphumulo was shot and killed in his car outside his house after returning from an ANC meeting last year. The defence attorneys for the suspects Sandile Mvelase, Nkosingiphile Nojiyeza and Phumlani Nojiyeza told the court that the accused would deny any involvement in the killing of Maphumulo. On Tuesday, investigating officer Bonginkosi Dlamini told the court that the accused are flight risks and that their release will endanger the safety of witnesses. Magistrate Thulani Mbuyazi has expressed his disappointment in what he sees as shortcomings in the police investigation. Mbuyazi says most of Dlamini’s key evidence emerged during his cross examination. This includes threats from angry service delivery protesters that Maphumulo will be killed and his house burnt down. Maphumulo was killed the same night.
