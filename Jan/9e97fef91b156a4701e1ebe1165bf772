As teachers and parents prepare themselves for smiles or tears from thousands of grade one children who start a journey of a lifetime on Wednesday morning, the Department of Basic Education is encouraging people to be optimistic about the 2019 academic year. The Department says schools are well prepared to receive those who have been placed in learning facilities. It says they’re working to ensure that learners, who have not been allocated classes yet, are placed in schools as soon as possible. The Department’s Spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga says around a million grade one learners are entering school for the first time Wednesday. “We are expecting about 1-million children starting in school today in grade one. When we look at the stats from ten years ago, it remained at exactly the same number. But we will have the final figure after two months, once all schools have given us their records. Those who have not been placed will be assisted from today in district offices. Parents have a huge role to play. They do not work with the department in some instances so they can get the help that they need. If you look at the system, you will see that there are parents who have not submitted documents to the department for them to be able to proceed with the allocations.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/641761">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on video below:
