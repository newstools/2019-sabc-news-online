The Eastern Cape department of Education says the collaboration  between the department and its stakeholders has led to the improvement of the 2018 matric results in the province. The province has attained a 70.6% pass rate for the first time since the dawn of democracy. The 2018 matric class improved in all aspects including academic subjects by over 5%. However one district, Amathole West has performed below 60%. Provincial Education MEC, Mlungisi Mvoko, says they will meet the leadership of the region in due course. “We do call the district they must account why they are performing that bad and we will call the principals they must account but also as the department we commit to support it and says and the department this is how we are committing to support you but they must tell us what the challenges.” A provincial top learner Avukile Nkayi, who passed all his subjects with seven distinctions, says he wants to use education to change the plight of his family. “My motivation is the plight of my family because I came from a poor back ground and I always tell myself so that I can change the situation of my family I am excited .”  Read social media comments below:
