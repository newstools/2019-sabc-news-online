Many Zimbabweans have reacted with frustration to President Emmerson Mnangagwa‘s sharp increase in the price of fuel. The aim of the measure is to improve supplies as the country struggles with its worst petrol shortages in a decade. Mnangagwa addressed the media in the capital, Harare. “A fuel pump price of $3.11-cents per litre for diesel and $3.31-cents per litre for petrol will come into effect. These prices are meant to keep fuel retailers viable. Guests of government by way of foreign missions and other registered foreign bodies and tourists will fuel and refuel at designated points at the price of $1.24 cents per litre for diesel and $2.2 cents per litre for petrol.” Some of the Zimbabweans say the increase in the price of fuel does not make sense. “After four days of sleeping in the queue then we pay 121 for 14 litres, that’s total rubbish and nonsensical, because how can he expect us to pay 337? Where can we get the money? Our salaries are peanuts. “ Another citizen says;” This is my second day sleeping at the petrol station, no bathing for the past two days because of the fuel. He must go, he’s a failure. “ Click below for more on the story:
