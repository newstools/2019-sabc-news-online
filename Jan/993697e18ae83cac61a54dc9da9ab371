A 29 year old man has drowned at the Wolfgat Nature Reserve on the False Bay coastline in Cape Town. Spokesperson of the National Sea Rescue Institute Craig Lambinon says the man had gone into the water to assist a 13 year-old girl who appeared to be drowning. Lambinon says he then got into difficulty. “Lifeguards from Monwabisi had arrived on scene and initiated CPR on a 29 year-old man. They were also attending to a female aged 13 and a man believed to be aged in his 30s who were both suffering non-fatal drownings. On arrival on scene, paramedics continued CPR efforts but sadly after all efforts were exhausted, he was declared deceased,” explains Lambinon.
