The woman, who allegedly tried to kill her baby at Hammarsdale, West of Durban, has abandoned bail. The mother, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her child, made a brief appearance on Monday at local Magistrate’s Court. The Hammarsdale Magistrate’s Court was packed to capacity  as the 30-year-old mother appeared concerned, with her head held down. The woman was arrested on New Year’s Day at her home in Hammarsdale west of Durban. Police were tipped off by neighbours who heard distressing screams coming from the woman’s house. It is alleged the woman was pregnant with twins, but only one baby was accounted for. The baby was allegedly found naked in bushes near the home of the accused. The woman is charged with attempted murder, birth concealment and child abuse. According to the police a shallow grave with bones was also discovered near the woman’s home. Upon investigation police believe the woman had also given birth to another child before the twins. It is alleged that the child was buried in a shallow grave. The bones were taken for DNA testing. The woman was expected to apply for bail, but she abandoned the application in a brief court appearance. The woman will remain in custody at the Westville Prison. She will reappear on the 14th of February. Watch video below:
