Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) President Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he’s accepted the party’s request for him to lead the IFP in this year’s general election campaign. Buthelezi reiterated that he would step down as party president after the elections. The party says it will hold its elective conference no later than July. Buthelezi says the party has once again endorsed Velenkosi Hlabisa – the mayor of the Big Five Hlabisa Municipality – to take over the reigns when he steps down. “The unanimous decision taken today (Saturday) by our extended national council to engage this election campaign first, before holding conference, carries heavy consequences for me and my family. I have been asked to lead the campaign as the party’s president. It’s not easy to accept what is being asked of me. In consultation with my family, and cognisant of the fact that I remain a servant of my people, I have agreed for one simple reason. The elections are little more than 100 days away, and if this is in the best interest of our party and of our country’s future.” The party is yet to announce its election manifesto day.
