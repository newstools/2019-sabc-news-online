African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on business people to partner with government in building the economy of South Africa. He was addressing minorities at Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu Natal. The ANC historically has a challenge in attracting minorities in KZN. The party will launch its election manifesto on Saturday at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Ramaphosa has promised that government will continue running SOEs better than in the past. “The call I’m making to all of you, let us see what we can do to contribute to move the country forward and hence the call we are going to make on Saturday has great resonance with what many people are feeling – that let’s work together and realise that we have no other country… we’ve only got this country and this is a great opportunity. It’s almost like a second chance for all of us as South Africans to do much as we possibly can.”
