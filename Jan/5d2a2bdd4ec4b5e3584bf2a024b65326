MEC for Education in Gauteng, Panyaza Lesufi will be visiting Hoërskool President in Ridgeway, in the south of Johannesburg on Friday morning. This after a video of a fight between two learners at the school went viral on social media.  Lesufi says the school has already identified ways to deal with the matter, but the department will be going to interview the affected learners and to check whether the school has the necessary systems in place. “We received a disturbing report about the incident. We are told that it’s learners that belong to different groupings within the school premises and there was a misunderstanding. But it involved other learners and that’s the reason we want to get explanations from the school so that we can understand whether the school was managing it or it was something that just developed.”
