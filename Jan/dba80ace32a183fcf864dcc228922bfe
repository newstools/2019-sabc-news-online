Southern African Development Community (SADC) has called for dialogue in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The regional bloc has also asked those who are aggrieved by the announced presidential election results in the country to use the available legal mechanisms. The DRC’s electoral board (CENI) on Thursday declared Felix Tshisekedi as the provisional winner. SADC joined other foreign powers that have reacted cautiously to the outcome of the DRC election results. Provisional results indicate that Tshisekedi led in the polls but his Martin Fayulu cried foul terming the results an “electoral coup.” The regional body called for restraint. The SADC statement just like that of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahmat did not congratulate the winner. The Catholic Church, Belgium and France have disputed the provisional results saying they do not reflect the data collected from observers. SADC urged for patience as the country awaits the release of final results
