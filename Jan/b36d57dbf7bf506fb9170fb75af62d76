The Democratic Alliance says it has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa demanding he take action against all political figures implicated in the Bosasa saga at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The DA has called on Ramaphosa to immediately institute an independent audit into all contracts between BOSASA and government – as well as to instruct cabinet to audit individual departments. Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi is expected to continue his testimony this week in Parktown. Sunday newspaper reports say he will implicate senior ANC members – including former President Jacob Zuma. The DA’s Graham Charters says Ramaphosa has a deadline of January 29 to respond to their demands. “President Ramaphosa must instruct cabinet to audit independent government contracts and deals with the state and instruct the Hawks to investigate the allegations and lastly to ensure that internal disciplinary action is instituted against all implicated ANC members.”  DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5690156-State-Capture-Media-Statement.js", {
