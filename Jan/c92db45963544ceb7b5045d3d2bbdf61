Registration at the University of Fort Hare in East London has come to a complete standstill. This after some students failed to get accommodation and others from poor communities were asked to pay a R3500 registration fee while waiting for NSFAS funding. “There is registration in progress but however students are unable to register for accommodation because the contract of these residences that the university has been using has expired. Now the students are here but there is no accommodation for them. The second part is the issue of first year students coming to register and coming from poor backgrounds are asked to pay R3500 that we don’t have. The third issue that we have is related to NSFAS. NSFAS decided that they are not going to open an extension for students,” explains SRC president Xolani Jaji.
