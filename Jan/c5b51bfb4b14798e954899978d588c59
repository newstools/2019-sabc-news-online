The Mokgoro Enquiry into the fitness to hold office of two suspended senior NPA advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi is hearing arguments from Jiba’s legal counsel. On Wednesday, the enquiry adjourned after Jiba’s legal team objected to senior prosecutor, Advocate Jan Ferreira’s anticipated evidence. They argued his evidence may prejudice their client, whose pending perjury and fraud charges are yet to be ventilated in court.
