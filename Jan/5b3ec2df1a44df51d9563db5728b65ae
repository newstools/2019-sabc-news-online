The Mokgoro Equiry, which is looking into fitness to hold office of two suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi,  has adjourned Wednesday’s proceedings until Thursday. This is to allow Jiba’s lawyers time to prepare submissions regarding the reservations they raised about senior prosecutor Advocate Jan Fereira’s anticipated evidence. Jiba’s legal counsel Thabani Masuku has raised concerns over Fereira’s appearance at the Enquiry saying it might prejudice Jiba’s pending perjury and fraud case. Meanwhile, Jiba and Mrwebi are yet to know the outcome of their appeal to the Constitutional Court. Judge Yvonne Mokgoro said it is in the interest of all parties involved to adjourn the hearings.
