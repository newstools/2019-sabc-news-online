The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the resignation of Tshwane Mayor, Solly Msimanga. EFF leader Julius Malema says they will now make sure that Msimanga’s resignation does not change the current control of the administration. Speaking during a tour in the areas north of Pretoria ahead of the launch of the EFF’s election manifesto in Soshanguve on Saturday, Malema said after Msimanga’s exit, the Tshwane Municipality would remain under the control of the opposition, not the African National Congress. “It will not have any impact. We are going to make sure the municipality remains in the hands of the people who will not take it back to where it comes from. We want to make sure that the municipality continues to deliver services to our people because Solly Msimanga was not the municipality. “The municipality was constituted by both politicians and administrators. So I think they are capable men and women particularly from the opposition who have the capacity to run that municipality and we are saying he must resign with immediate effect because by the look of things he wants to buy time. He says he will only leave on 11 February. He must go now. So that we put the interim measures while we are working on getting a permanent solution,” Malema argued.
