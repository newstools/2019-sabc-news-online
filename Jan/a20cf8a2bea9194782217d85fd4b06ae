The family of the late soccer star – Philemon Masinga says they will forever be thankful for his positive life and the role he played in many people’s lives, particularly in the soccer fraternity. Masinga’s wife, Ntombi paid tribute at the funeral service underway at Khuma Stadium, near Klerksdorp in North West. She says her husband was respected, responsible and a hardworking man, at home and professionally. “You worked hard and tirelessly to ensure the well-being of our family. I can proudly stand here and say you were never a charity case. If ever you received help, it’s because you were the first to have offered it. You were resilient in your efforts, you loved deeply. I am honoured to have been loved by you.” Masinga died two weeks ago at the Johannesburg hospital after battling with cancer for a while. Mourners across the country are expected to come in large numbers to bid farewell to the soccer legend. Soccer legends alike and friends of the late soccer star, say his role in the South African football fraternity should forever be cherished and respected. Masinga’s former boss Jomo Sono and colleague Doctor Khumalo say Masinga’s talent was very unique and incomparable. Sono and Khumalo paid their tribute to Masinga. They had this to say: “Nobody, it does not matter how much money you have, what Chippa did for this country and for what Chippa did for the clubs he played, no money can buy it.” “Mambotjie we salute you for what you did for our country. Lastly, on behalf of Chippa we would like to thank all the South Africans for gracing this icon for what he gave us as a nation.” Public and private transport in the form of buses was arranged to ferry mourners to Khuma Stadium.
