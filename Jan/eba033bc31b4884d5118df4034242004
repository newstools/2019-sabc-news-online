The first day of registration at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein is progressing smoothly. Earlier this month the Free Education Movement halted operations, demanding National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) holders to register, even though they have outstanding fees. The movement also opposes a fee hike for the 2019 academic year. Queues are moving fast, with prospective students saying they’re getting sufficient assistance from management,“I arrived here at around 8 and the line has been moving smoothly.” “I’m here to register for my postgraduate honours, and I’m happy with how the line is moving, in fact this one is better than the previous years,” says one of the students. Senior students are also still being registered. The Free Education Movement is satisfied with assurances from management. Free Education Movement Leader Asive Dlanjwa says, “We have been able to find each other and resolved and found amicable ways of ensuring that the poor and the marginalised are not excluded and marginalised from the institution. In that they are able to gain access into the institution. So as far as that is concerned we are happy, also students who were being rejected and being told to go back home.” Walk-ins are not allowed.
