Two traffic officers are expected to appear in the Middleburg Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga on Wednesday for alleged corruption. The pair allegedly demanded a R200 bribe from a taxi driver. The driver then reported them to the police, who acted on the tip-off and arrested the two. The provincial police spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi, says the taxi driver was refunded. “Two traffic officers attached at the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality are expected to appear before the Middleburg Magistrate Court today facing charges of corruption. They were arrested on 31 December and since then they were kept in custody, hence their appearance today. It is alleged that on that day, the two traffic officers stopped a taxi driver and subsequently to that we are told of developments that they in actual fact requested a sum of R200.”
