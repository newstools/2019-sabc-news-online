The Khula Development Trust, an NGO looking into the rights of children and women in the Eastern Cape, says it’s gravely concerned about lack of safety for learners and teachers. A 15-year-old boy allegedly stabbed and killed a fellow 16-year old learner at the Mpeko Primary School in Peddie. This is the second such incident in less than six months. The teenager is under arrest and police processed the child in terms of the Child Justice act. Director of Khula Development Trust, Petros Majola, has called on the department to take the issue of safety at schools seriously. “I have approached the department to say let us sit down so that we can see what is it that we want to do because one, all schools must be fenced; two, there should be the access control … the entrance of the school premises, whether it will delay the kids to enter the school, but we can not just open to everyone to walk in and out. But there should be something that is done,” says Majola. Mother of the deceased Nokholo Deyi says she’s battling to come to terms with the loss. “I’m not happy at all. It touched me more when they brought the shoes that I recently bought for him in December. I got a job in Mossel Bay and bought him shoes. Now, he’s no more,” says Deyi The provincial education department says it’s going to work with South African Police Service to provide safety at the schools in the province.
