Two South African Revenue Service (SARS) employees and a former police officer, are expected to appear at the Lehurutshe Regional Court in the North West on Tuesday morning. They are facing charges of fraud, this after they were arrested by the Hawks last year in October. The suspects, former police officer Obokeng Diale and two SARS customs officials, Gosego Gaebetswe and Shimane Motshabi, were since each granted bail of R10 000, following their arrest for ghost fuel export fraud. The trio were arrested following investigations into an alleged fraudulent fuel scheme, where the former police officer would allegedly pay the customs officials approximately R35 000 per transaction, to process fictitious transactions. The fuel was exported through the Skilpadshek border post. Thereafter documents would allegedly be submitted to SARS to claim revenue for the fuel trade that never took place. It is alleged that the money involved is over three million rand.
