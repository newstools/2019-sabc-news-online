The Transport Minister, Blade Nzimande, has condemned the blockade of the N3 Van Reenen and Tugela Plaza along the busy highway on Sunday night. The north and southbound lanes on the N3 were blockaded by truck drivers from eight in the evening. Four truck drivers were arrested and their trucks impounded. The route was opened early on Monday morning. “The minister says that guided by the law and applicable legislation, government remains steadfast to resolve this issue that is beginning to bedevil the South African trucking industry. “Minister Nzimande further said that government cannot tolerate lawlessness, anarchy and sabotage demonstrated by some truck drivers who determined to act with apparent impunity,” says Ishmail Mnisi, Transport Department Spokesperson. Meanwhile the Management of N3 Toll Concession says it’s still waiting for Police investigations to conclude what what could have sparked the closure of the freeway at Van Reenen due to a protest this morning. The blockade resulted in the tourching of two trucks. N3 Toll Concession Commercial Manager Con Roux has called for parties to resolve their differences amicably. “Our appeal to all the stakeholders would be to get together in a room and to talk and see where is possible to come up with sensible resolutions to respect the importance of that economic corridor. We all know that our President has reiterated the importance of economic growth to the country.”
