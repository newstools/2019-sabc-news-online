South Africa’s 2019 looks set for a wet start, with thunderstorms expected to continue across the country on Tuesday. Those hoping to enjoy their New Year’s Day outdoors will have to contend with rainy conditions in all provinces though temperatures will be more conducive, ranging from the mid-20s to lower 30-degrees Celcius. SABC weather forecaster, Siphesihle Kunene, says, “Gauteng is going to be wet. I know it is the first of the year and we are looking at braaing and celebrating but as we saw yesterday we couldn’t in Gauteng. But looking at the rest of the week we don’t really have a chance to celebrate. Clear skies for most of the interior, scattered showers over the east including the Eastern Cape. We have a couple of watches over the central parts. Heavy rains may lead to localised flooding because of the continuous rain we’ve had since yesterday and even today. Severe thunderstorms may lead to hail and strong damaging winds.” Click link for more
