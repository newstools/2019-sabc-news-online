International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says itâ€™s unacceptable for South Africans to be involved in activities that destabilise other countries. This follows reports of charges against South Africa citizen Andre Hanekom related to his alleged aiding of an extreme jihadist group that is destabilising the northern part of Mozambique. A South African and two Tanzanians are among leaders of a jihadist group reported to be operating in the northern gas-rich region. According to reports these groups wants to create an independent state. Hanekom, 60, was formally arrested in August in a hospital after being seized by military from a restaurant in the gas industry hub town of Palma. Dirco Spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya says the Minister has called for a thorough investigation into the matter. More than 800 South Africans are in prisons across the world for crimes, including fraud, drug possession and violent crimes, with the majority in the Americas for drug-related convictions.
