The African National Congress (ANC) Deputy President David Mabuza has acknowledged that lack of water and poor roads infrastructure are the main challenges in the Giyani area of Limpopo. Mabuza says the government is, however, determined to deal with these problems. The Giyani area was declared a disaster area by the former President Jacob Zuma about five years ago due to drought. The multi-million rand water project to draw water from Nandoni Dam outside Thohoyandou to Giyani has hit a snag. Mabuza was conducting a voter registration campaign in the area. “In this area, we’ve got problem of water; our road infrastructure. Since this morning, people have been telling me about two things. Well, poverty is rife. It’s very bad. We’ll try and intervene where we can. You must realize that the challenge that we’re facing is too huge, it’ll take us time to address problem of housing; problem of water, problem of electricity, these things are very costly, but we’re determined I think we will,” says Mabuza.
