It’s a week since the 19-hour ordeal at the DusitD2 hotel in Kenya’s capital Nairobi and more stories of valiant efforts by hotel staff and the police are emerging. A 34-year-old hotel staffer Bernadette Konjalo is being hailed a heroine, for putting herself in harm’s way to save the lives of guests. Konjalo worked as a manager at the hotel. The SABC news spoke to her brother Kelly in Yeoville, as the tragedy unfolded. He says a few hours after speaking to the SABC his worst fears were confirmed, that his sister had died in that tragedy. “I got a call that my sister was no more they had confirmed that she got burned marks. When the first gun shots happened she decided to enquire and came to help the rest of the guests to come out of the hotel. She was loving. She took upon herself to come and see my son. That was six weeks ago. That’s how much she was loving and dedicated to the family.” Click on video below:
