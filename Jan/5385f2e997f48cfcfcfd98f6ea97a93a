Eastern Cape Co-operative Governance MEC, Fikile Xasa, has called on all parties involved in the King Sabatha Dalindyebo (KSD) Municipal strike to quickly find a resolution. The strike has left Mthatha looking like a dump site. Xasa held a meeting with municipal leadership and the workers’ unions Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (IMATU) and South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) near the municipal offices. The unions are calling for permanent employment for workers under the Extended Public Works Programme as well as the removal of Mayor Dumani Zozo and acting municipal manager Mbulelo Sigaba. For close to two weeks refuse has not been collected. “I’ve made a call to say we can’t treat people of Mthatha the way we are treating them. They are South African citizens. They cannot live in this atmosphere and we have asked the people who are saying they are not in action, but the town is dirty that it should come to a stop. We are a country that is governed by laws. If there’s anybody who has got any issue he wants to raise they are free to raise and we also appeal to the leadership to say when people ask questions we must respond and respond on time. So we are urging them to say this thing should come to a stop,” explains Xasa. Watch video below:
