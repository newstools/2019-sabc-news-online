Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police says it is waiting for a letter written by Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert Mcbride in which he objects to a decision by Police Minister Bheki Cele not to renew his contract when it comes to an end at the end of next month. The letter is currently with National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete. McBride has among others exposed large scale corruption in the South African Police Service (SAPS) allegedly involving former acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and SAPS suppliers. He was also instrumental in uncovering attempts to allegedly use funds from Police Crime Intelligence to buy votes for the African National Congress. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman says, “We believe there should be a cordial and working relationship between the executive authority and the relevant department within the peace and stability cluster. And we believe that all parties must work towards that ideal that there can be stability and a cordial relationship to ensure that there’s outcomes that are positive. If the matter in terms of the legal issues and Parliament is referred to us by the Speaker, we of course will look at the contents, apply our mind and you know come to a conclusion.”
