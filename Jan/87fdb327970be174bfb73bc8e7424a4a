Disgruntled residents of Amadiba village near Mbizana in the Eastern Cape are hoping resolutions taken to address their concerns will be followed. They halted the construction of the R1.6 billion Mtentu Bridge, alleging that jobs were being sold. They have since reached consensus with government. The construction of one of the highest and longest bridges in the Southern Hemisphere was brought to an abrupt halt in October 2018 by community leaders who say that it did not benefit residents. They allege people were asked to pay money upfront to get work. Business owner Thwetsha Silangwe says that people paid to get jobs that were promised to residents. “People had to pay to get jobs, but we were promised to be part of the development. We haven’t been part of anything here. We were promised that some of the corrupt members are removed in the steering committee as promised.” Resident Winiswa Madolwana says that residents are given low paying jobs. “We were promised development and better jobs. We get scraps here and low paying jobs. We wish they will really look into this.” Roads MEC Weziwe Tikana says that the department has resolved to use local suppliers and hire local unskilled labour.
