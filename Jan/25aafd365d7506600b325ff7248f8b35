Political analyst, William Mpofu, has warned of the possibility of mass protests in Zimbabwe if its government fails to find a solution to the latest fuel price increase. The price of fuel in Zimbabwe increased by 150 % over the weekend, causing outrage in the country. President Emmerson Mnangagwa says the increases are aimed at addressing a shortfall caused by increased gasoline demands and rampant illegal trade. Mpofu has described the latest development as a crisis of confidence, legitimacy and credibility in government. “This is a crisis of confidence, legitimacy and credibility that is creating this catastrophe. The president cannot reign in corrupt officials and business moguls because they are in the same political network with them, the same business network with him. His hands are tied and he is unable to deal with the situation except continue punishing the poor masses of Zimbabwe. It is a serious political problem that needs a political solution, otherwise the economy will continue to degenerate and it could lead to a serious problem where people take to the streets and riot and the situation becomes uncontrollable,” says Mpofu.
