Home Affairs Minister, Siyabonga Cwele, says OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg had the highest volume of travellers over the past festive season. He was speaking at a media briefing in Pretoria. Cwele says the airport had over 997 000 travellers passing through during the holiday season. “OR Tambo International Airport cleared the highest volumes with just under a million people that went through. It was followed by Beit Bridge with 884 000. Lebombo border post – 625 000. Maseru Bridge – 428 000. I thank our travellers for their conduct during this period and all officials across government for meticulous planning, execution and responsiveness to the operational methods during this festive season.”
