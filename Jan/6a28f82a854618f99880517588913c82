African National Congress deputy president David Mabuza says the fact that some party officials have been implicated in state capture doesn’t mean that the governing party is guilty of wrongdoing. The latest witness, former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi, has testified before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that the facility and management company paid bribes to Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and bought her groceries. The company also allegedly organised former President Jacob Zuma’s 72nd birthday celebrations and paid tuition fees for ANC MP Vincent Smith’s daughter. Mabuza doesn’t believe that the allegations will affect the ANC during the elections, saying voters can differentiate between the party and individuals. He was speaking during the voter registration campaign in Giyani, Limpopo. “We must be able to separate ANC from individuals. If there’s something where I’m implicated firstly I’d have an opportunity to reply myself we must not confuse ANC with individuals leaders of the ANC will come and go but the ANC as a living organism will remain so people are aware that it’s not the ANC which is implicated it’s an individual.”
