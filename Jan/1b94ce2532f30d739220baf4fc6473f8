He was a central figure in the formation of Metal Workers Trade Union (Limusa).  General Secretary for Limusa, Siboniso Mdletshe says: “We knew in November that he was not well and from December he was in and out of the hospital. As Limusa family, we’ve always been there, and it got a little bit worse towards the end of December.”
