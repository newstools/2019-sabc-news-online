Fees Must Fall leader, Bonginkosi Khanyile, has vowed to continue the struggle for free education. Khanyile has been sentenced to three years correctional supervision in the Durban Regional Court, following violent student protests in 2016. He pleaded guilty on charges of public violence, failing to obey police instructions and the possession of a dangerous weapon. He will be placed under house arrest.  Khanyile also has to perform community service and undergo programmes on life skills and to deal with aggression. “They think I am going to be broken, I am going to surrender. I am not broken, I am not shaken, I am immovable. That is clear in our position. Nothing, I am a free man. Let me tell you, the only thing you need if you want to achieve your ideas in your society, you must ensure that prison, you are not scared of it. They introduce prison, they bring their police force. They try to hinder an idea whose time has come. That they cannot do,” says Khanyile. Watch video below:
