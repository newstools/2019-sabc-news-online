The Women in Ministry formation have released a statement extending gratitude to all groups and individuals who stood in solidarity against the remarks attributed to Reverend Vukile Mehana. Mehana has come under fire after recording of a telephone conversation, allegedly between Mehana and church member Raymond Sibanda was leaked,  in which he can be heard making derogatory comments about female church ministers. The Women in Ministry formation says that although the remarks have brought the MCSA under disrepute. It is comforting to know that there are groups and individuals who continue to stand for the principles of equality, transformation and human rights. The statement goes on to say that the women in ministry note with much appreciation the South African council of churches statement which is a courageous act of Ecumenical solidarity. Rev Dix Sibeko and Rev Jenni Samdaan, Incoming Coordinator for Methodist Church Women in Ministry, speak on Rev Mehana’s utterances.
