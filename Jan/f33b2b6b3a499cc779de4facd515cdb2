President Cyril Ramaphosa has conveyed his condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of trade unionist Cedric Gina, who passed away earlier on Monday at the age of 48. Gina, a founding member of metal workers union Limusa and former president of Numsa, passed away in Durban, after a short illness. President Ramaphosa said in a statement it is sad to learn of the death of a youthful, talented and dedicated leader of the working class and society at large. Ramaphosa says the labour movement and the country in general have been deprived of benefiting from the full potential of Ginaâ€™s contribution to society and to the betterment of the status of workers.
