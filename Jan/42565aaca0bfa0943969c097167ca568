Helen Zille had the twitter community as well as the offline community buzzing this weekend, following a series of tweets where she claimed that all those voting for the ANC were accomplices to corruption and she would lead a Tax Revolt. The hashtag Tax Revolt or Tax Boycott has left people with divided views. Zille says that taxpayers will not continue forking up billions to corruption and that if this continues, she was going to be the first to mobilise a tax strike to bring this government to its senses. Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says their website states that they have been approached to drive such a move. Outa Chairperson Wayne Duvenage says, “The people that would get hurt the most are the poor and the very people calling for this do not understand the consequences of declined security at border posts and ports and so forth. You cannot manage a country in a full tax revolt.”     WATCH FULL INTERVIEW:
