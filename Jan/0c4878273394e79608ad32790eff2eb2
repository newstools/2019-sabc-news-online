The Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete says there is nothing sinister about some dignitaries not responding to their invitation to attend the opening of Parliament. Her statement comes after reports that former President Jacob Zuma has not yet indicated whether he will attend the opening of Parliament or not. Parliament’s presiding officers have sent out invitations to former presidents ahead of the State of the Nation Address on 7 February . Former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe as well as former National Assembly speakers, Frene Ginwala and Max Sisulu, have confirmed their attendance. Mbete says fact that Zuma has not yet indicated whether he will attend the opening of Parliament does not automatically mean he has rejected the invitation. “There’s nothing strange about some of the dignitaries sometimes not attending or replying to us and confirming attendance, maybe a day or two before the actual occasion. So, at this point, all we can say is that we have not yet received acceptance or confirmation of attendance from the former president. But we don’t think that should be for any worry, because he might still be going to respond to us and accepting our invitation.” Click below for more on the story:
