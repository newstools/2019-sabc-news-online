Former South African ambassador to the United Nations (UN), Dumisani Khumalo has been laid to rest at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg on Saturday. He was described as a South African, Pan Africanist and a humanitarian during his funeral held at Calvary Methodist Church in Midrand. Former President Thabo Mbeki says the nation has lost a remarkable man with many talents and he will forever be remembered for his role at the United Nations. Ambassador Kumalo distinguished himself by campaigning for South Africa to be a non-permanent member on the Security Council. This is something that former Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says the country will always be grateful for. His son Mandla has described Kumalo as a disciplinarian. The anti-apartheid activist was a diplomat from 1999 to 2009. Click below for more on the story:
