Police have found 762 rounds of live ammunition hidden in a shallow grave in East London in the Eastern Cape. Police spokesperson Captain Hazel Mqala says police were trying to pursue alleged drug dealers when they stumbled upon the ammunition. Captain Mqala says police recovered a firearm licence amongst the ammunition. She says they have traced the owner who has alleged that several of his firearms and a substantial amount of ammunition were stolen during a house breaking in November 2016. One of his firearms has since been recovered in Cambridge. No arrests have been made.
