The Animal Welfare Society says strict security measures are needed to prevent the theft of medication at animal welfare organisations across the country. Chief Executive, John McMullen, says they are investigating a number of cases of dodgy and fake vets operating in the Cape Town area. They apparently illegally gained access to medicines in organisations they previously worked for. McMullen says their actions have allegedly led to multiple incidents of illness and death of pets. “In a welfare society where there are a lot of drugs, keeping controls in place even with CCTV cameras is difficult. Here at the welfare society, we count our vaccines we use everyday and return the bottles and count the empty bottles – that’s how bad it is. Usually there is minor pilfering or in some cases major theft from the organisations.” Click on Facebook Post below:
