African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed poverty and unemployment during his speech at the launch the ANC 2019 Election Manifesto event at Moses Mabhida stadium in Durban, KwaZulu Natal. The event is attended by former President Jacob Zuma, Alliance partners, fraternal organisations from the African continent as well as thousands of ANC supporters. In his speech Ramaphosa said, “Our people are embracing the ‘new dawn’ and demonstrate renewed commitment to tackling unemployment, poverty and inequality. The values of respect, equality, dignity and integrity exemplify this period of working together towards transformation of our society.” He said the ANC was mobilising all social partners behind an economic recovery plan. “This has been demonstrated through the Presidential Jobs Summit, which agreed on a series of measures to create additional jobs and protect existing ones.” Windy weather in Durban delayed the start of the ANC’s 2019 election manifesto, with strong winds from early this morning forcing the 9am start time to be delayed by at least two hours. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>  Read the President’s speech below:  EMBED: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5683706-ADDRESS-by-PRESIDENT-CYRIL-RAMAPHOSA-at-the.js", {
