The family of the victims of the deadly Mountain View train crash earlier this month have pleaded with government to fix problems with train operations as soon as possible. Two of the four passengers who were killed in the crash, Dick and Sarah Sekoma, were laid to rest in Soshanguve north of Pretoria Saturday morning. They were travelling with their two daughters when the accident happened. Preliminary investigations by the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) found that the crash, in which more than 600 passengers were injured, was caused by human error. The Sekoma’s leave behind six children between the ages of three and 18. Family spokesperson Tsakane Nkumane says: “They must fix the trains; they must ensure that before people can get into trains they are in a condition, that Prasa employees are comfortable with using them.” “They mustn’t give us trains just for the sake of it. They must fix their signalling because that’s the reasons we are here today. Their signals do not work,” says Nkumane. Related Video:
