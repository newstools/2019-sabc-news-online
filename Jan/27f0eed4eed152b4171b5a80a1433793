African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says he has a good working relationship with former president Jacob Zuma.  He has dismissed speculation that he wants to use their planned meeting to request Zuma to refrain from making some public comments. Ramaphosa and Zuma arrived together at the ANC 107th anniversary celebrations in Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal.  Ramaphosa says both former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Zuma are a source of wisdom for the ANC. Ramaphosa  says many people are speculating that he wants to call to order Zuma, but he says he does not know that, and that those rumours are not true. He says they have good relationship and he is going to work with Zuma on various tasks. Ramaphosa says he is lucky to be ANC president while two former presidents are still alive. Ramaphosa says the previous presidents have rich knowledge and history of the organisation. He says the party’s 107th anniversary is a moment to look at the contribution of former ANC leaders to the advancement of the party’s collective vision. Ramaphosa says an independent judiciary and a free press are some of the highlights in South Africa’s democracy. “We can report that South Africa, as he (Mandela) wished, is a united, non-racial, democracy. We have a progressive Constitution that recognises the injustices of the past and requires that we take all necessary steps to achieve redress in all areas of life. We have durable democratic institutions, an independent judiciary, a free media and active citizenry.” Click below for more on the story:
