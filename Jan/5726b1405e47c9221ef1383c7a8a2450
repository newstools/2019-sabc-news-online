Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is back on the witness stand on Monday morning at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. This will be his eighth day of testimony that had implicated, amongst others, several high-ranking officials in the Department of Correctional Services in massive corruption and tender rigging. He is expected to wrap up his testimony over the next two days. While Agrizzi has continued to drop major bombshells at the commission, he is not done yet. In his previous testimony he implicated three senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials who allegedly received monthly bribes from Bosasa. This included, suspended National Director of Public Prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba, advocate Lawrence Mrwebi, and Jackie Lephinka. Agrizzi is expected to name more officials who have been allegedly involved in corrupt activities with Bosasa.
