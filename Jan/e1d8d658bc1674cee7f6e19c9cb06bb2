The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Agriculture Department has called on people to take their dogs to the department’s local offices to get them vaccinated against rabies. The department started a special drive last year after at least six people contracted rabies. The department, which is working with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and private veterinarians, aims to vaccinate 70% of the dogs in the province. Department spokesperson Phathisa Mafuyo says another special drive will start next month. “There are 14 cases of rabies, animals that have been reported to the department, but no human cases have been reported so far this year. So there is no outbreak of rabies in the province, but we are urging all animal owners to take their dogs to our nearest local offices for the department to ensure that their dogs are vaccinated. This is part of an ongoing campaign by the department to ensure that we stop rabies from spreading to humans.”
