Traffic volumes have started to increase on major traffic routes across the country as holidaymakers have begun making their way back home. Many are getting ready to return to work and for the re-opening of schools next week. In KwaZulu-Natal, the Road Traffic Inspectorate says there’s been a steady increase in the number of vehicles on the roads since early Saturday morning. More than 1 700 vehicles an hour have been recorded travelling on the N3 from Durban at the Marianhill Toll plaza. KZN RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu-Mali has urged motorists to continue to take road safety seriously. “We are experiencing high volumes of traffic today; holidaymakers are making their way towards their respective destinations.  However we are out and about, to monitor the roads across the province and to ensure the safety of motorists. Traffic count taken at Marianhill Plaza north bound -1 716, southbound – 869,  Mooi River  – 1 287, Tugela north bound – 904 and southbound – 471. We urge motorists to drive cautiously.” Meanwhile, traffic volumes towards Gauteng from Limpopo are slowly increasing on the N1. Both the Kranskop Toll Plaza and Nyl Toll Gate have opened more lanes for traffic heading south, to accommodate the increasing number of vehicles. Congestion is expected to be observed on the N1 road in Limpopo throughout the weekend. Traffic officials are visible at most spots between the two major toll gates. Volumes are also expected to increase for traffic coming back into the province.
