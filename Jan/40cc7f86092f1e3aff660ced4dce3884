The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Gauteng says Transport MEC Ismail Vadi and Transport Minister Blade Nzimande must take responsibility for Tuesday’s fatal train collision in Pretoria. The party says that the two have failed to hold PRASA accountable for the many deaths in the past. Since January last year, 22 people have died in train crashes on the country’s railway lines. EFF Gauteng’s Chairperson Mandisa Mashego says Vadi and Nzimande should consider the fact that train commuters are vulnerable members of society. “What we are saying is that we want Ismail Vadi to get directly involved, to make sure as the MEC for Transport in Gauteng that the issues of safety and anxiety and the concerns of our commuters who are 100% the black working class. We need him to make sure that the correct compensation level is starting to be given.” Click on video below:
