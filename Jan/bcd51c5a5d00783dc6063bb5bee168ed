Two people have been shot dead at the notorious Glebelands hostel at Umlazi south of Durban.  According to provincial police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele, the motive of the attack is unknown but cases of murder have been opened. Scores of people have been killed in the hostel in the recent past in what is believed to the politically motivated attacks. The attacks happened as eight men, who were earlier arrested in connection with the killings at the hostel appear in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. They are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, racketeering and possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. Mbhele says they are investigating the latest killings, “It is alleged that yesterday after nine two victims aged 29 and 41 were at Glebeland hostel, block 50 when they were attacked by unknown suspects who opened fire and fatally wounded them. They sustained gunshot wounds in the head and the body and the matter is investigated by provincial crime unit based in the provincial office. At the moment the motive of the killing is unknown and we have started the investigation.”
