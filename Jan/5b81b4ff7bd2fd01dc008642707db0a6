It is D-Day for Edward Zuma, the son of former President Jacob Zuma, for him to pay an outstanding fine amount set by the Equality Court, after he made racial slurs against Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom. Zuma wrote an open letter in July of 2017 where he used derogatory words against the two African National Congress (ANC) leaders. The Human Rights Commission then took Edward Zuma to the Equality Court where he was fined R60 000 and ordered to write an apology for his comments. Edward Zuma has until the end of business hours on Tuesday to pay the outstanding balance owed in his hate speech case, or face an arrest warrant for contempt of court. Watch related video:
