The African National Congress’s (ANC) Head of Elections in the Western Cape, Ebrahim Rasool, says the party has deployed thousands of volunteers to encourage people to register during the final round of voter registration this weekend. He was addressing a media briefing in Cape Town. Rasool says they’re targeting new registrations, “We are looking for this weekend for the ANC to register at least a 100 000 new registrations in every area of the Western Cape and we therefore will be present in every ward across the Western Cape. If you have almost 12 000 volunteers, you can work on the basis of 20 per voting district.” Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) in the Eastern Cape says it’s more than ready for the final voter registration drive this weekend.  But a number of threats to boycott the registration weekend have emanated from some areas in the province where community members are protesting over service delivery and demarcation disputes. Residents from the embattled Amahlathi Municipality have vowed to chase out IEC staff in the area due to differences with the ruling party in the province. IEC provincial electoral commission spokesperson Khayakazi Magumana says they are aware of some hotspots in the province. “Already there are cases where we are getting letters from communities that as the IEC that we should bother and open those stations this coming weekend ,” says Magumana.
