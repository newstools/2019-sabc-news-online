The Democratic Alliance (DA) has laid charges of corruption against the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Nomvula Mokonyane, for her alleged role in state capture. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that Mokonyane received monthly bribes. The facility and management company’s motivation for bribing Mokonyane was to receive more business from the African National Congress (ANC) and the state. The DA’s second Deputy Federal Chair, Natasha Mazzone, has laid the charges in Cape Town earlier on Tuesday. “State Capture is a very real thing in our country and it’s caused a great deal of suffering and pain in our country. The fact of the matter is that Nomvula Mokonyane is a sitting minister. She’s a sitting member of the executive and it’s important that we lay these charges today because she is a public representative. As we speak, she represents four million South Africans in Parliament and we simply cannot allow Members of Parliament and certainly ministers in the executive to be tainted by these very, very serious accusations of corruption,” says Mazzone. The ANC says it will not ask Mokonyane and party Member of Parliament Vincent Smith to step down while the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is still underway. Agrizzi implicated the two in corruption when he testified before the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Acting ANC Spokesperson in the presidency, Zizi Kodwa, says it would be premature for the party to act against the implicated members. “People who are implicated, are implicated and it’s important to make that distinction because if people are implicated it does not mean we must run. What we call in the statement; firstly, we are avoiding to do a running commentary in each testimony of a witness. A testimony that is not cross-examined, a testimony which is not collaborated,” says Kodwa.  Watch a related video below:
