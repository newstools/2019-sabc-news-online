Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says he would be deeply concerned if people in his office were to be involved in wrongdoing. His statement comes after former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi implicated individuals from the Justice Department during his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Agrizzi told the Commission about a contract awarded to Bosasa subsidiary Sondolo IT by the Justice Department which was to supply secure systems for the country’s courts. Certain individuals were given bribes for influencing the awarding of the tender to Bosasa. The allegations have led to Commission Secretary Khotso De Wee taking special leave after Agrizzi implicated him. Mogoeng was addressing members of the media at the 10th Annual Conference of Constitutional Jurisdictions of Africa in Midrand. “Security for the courts does not fall within the domain of the judiciary or the office of the Chief Justice. It is one of those functions that have been held back by the Ministry of Justice. So it is the Ministry that would know what relationship if any that they had with Bosasa.”
