The community of Mnga flats farms in Ugie in the Eastern Cape has accused the Elundini Local Municipality of neglecting it. This after a devastating storm ripped through the area leaving houses and vehicles damaged as well as livestock dead. One of the affected residents Thembeni Mqhamkana says although municipal officials came to assess their situation, nothing has happened. “We received an unexpected tragedy where we lost our crop, houses and vehicles which we won’t be able to recover anytime soon. Our livestock has died, the storm has caused enormous damage which is now a setback for the community,” says Mqhamkana. Several attempts to get comment from the Elundini Local Municipality were unsuccessful.
