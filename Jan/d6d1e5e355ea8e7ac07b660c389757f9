The Limpopo Department of Agriculture has established a task team consisting of police and traffic officers to eliminate movement of livestock in the area, where foot-and-mouth disease has been detected. The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Limpopo has halted the export of products from cloven hoof animals such as cattle, pig and goats. Veterinarians from both the national and provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries will start with control measures on Friday at Sundani village in the Vhembe District. “We have established a task team. It’s a joint operation to look at the impact and the contingency measures. The task team will include other government departments such as the police, traffic as well as a health colleague. We want to make sure that we eliminate the movement of livestock in the area concern,” says Selby Makgotho, Provincial Spokesperson of the department.
