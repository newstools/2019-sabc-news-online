Firefighters are focusing on mopping up operations after the Houwhoek fire in the Overberg region was brought under control overnight. Teams worked throughout the night as it threatened farms and structures in the Botrivier area. Overberg Fire Chief Reinard Geldenhuys says it crossed the mountain, fanned by strong winds. He says fresh teams will go in Friday morning to capitalise on the cooler temperatures and calmer winds. “The ground teams worked very hard with landowners and the fire department to contain the remaining flanks. The fire is under control but we’ve got one flank that is still burning up in the mountain that a team is bringing down as we speak. At this stage it’s looking good there’s been no structure damage. We need to go into this day mopping up and so on,” says Geldenhuys.
