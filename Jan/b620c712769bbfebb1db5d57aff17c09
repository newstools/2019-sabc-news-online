ACDP leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe has strongly condemned Democratic Republic of Congo‘s electoral commission saying they prematurely announced the results of the presidential elections. A Congolese election observer mission says the official results of the presidential vote have been largely received with calm across the country, despite some reported irregularities. Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi was named the winner of Congo’s presidential election on Thursday. The delayed results came after international pressure to announce an outcome that reflected the will of the people. Meshoe says these elections were not free and fair. “I think their equivalent of our IEC has made a big mistake. How do you announce elections when there are regions that have not voted? Because if they are going to include all votes that might change the outcome.” Meanwhile, ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile has declared the readiness of the ruling party to uphold a free and fair vote in 2019’s general elections. He has been speaking in light of the DRC presidential election results which have been widely criticized. Opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was declared the winner of Congo’s presidential election, but his victory was dismissed by the runner-up and questioned by the Catholic Church, clouding the vote’s legitimacy. Mashatile says the ruling party will do whatever it takes to ensure peaceful elections in South Africa. “In South Africa, we had a number of elections that have gone as fair and free elections. We are hoping that this election as well will be free and fair. As the ANC, we will do our part to contribute to the climate of good elections.” “We will ensure that our members abide by the code and work with the rule of law because if you want to strengthen democracy. We will make sure there are no issues.” Click video below for more on the story:
