The communications ministry is embarking on a roll out of digital technologies in the Vhembe district of Limpopo this week. This, in a bid to bridge the digital divide between urban and rural South Africa and to promote cyber-crime awareness. The drive will see various digital services unveiled at public facilities – and it is hoped that this will go a long way in achieving the vision of building a capable skills set for the impending fourth industrial revolution.
