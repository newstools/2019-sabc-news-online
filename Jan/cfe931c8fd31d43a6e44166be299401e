The African National Congress (ANC) says it will not ask its National Executive Committee member Nomvula Mokonyane and party Member of Parliament Vincent Smith to step down while the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is still underway. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi implicated the two in corruption when he testified before the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Agrizzi says Mokonyane was getting a monthly bribe from Bosasa which also paid tuition fees for Smith’s daughter when she was studying abroad. The facilities management company’s motivation for bribing Mokonyane was to receive more business from the ANC and the State. Acting ANC spokesperson in the Presidency Zizi Kodwa says it would be premature for the party to act against the implicated members. “People who are implicated, are implicated and it’s important to make that distinction because if people are implicated it does not mean we must run what we call in the statement. Firstly, we are avoiding to do running commentary in each testimony of a witness that is not cross-examined, or collaborated.”
