Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the province will not rest until township schools also achieve top matric results. Makhura was speaking at Unisa in Pretoria where Gauteng MEC Panyaza Lesufi is releasing matric results for his province. The province achieved a 87,9 percent matric pass rate, topping all provinces. Makhura says there’s still more work to be done in township schools. Makhura says, “Until children from the townships can get the best education they have ever had, we can’t say we are improving our education. We measure ourselves around the townships, how is education doing in our townships.” Click below to watch MEC Panyaza Lesufi releasing Gauteng’s matric results:
