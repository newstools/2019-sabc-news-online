Gauteng Premier David Makhura has described the late Khabisi Mosunkutu as a humble man, who never compromised on issues of principle. The African National Congress (ANC) senior official and former MEC died on Christmas eve at the age of 69 – after battling ill-health for some time. Mosunkutu served as Member of the Executive Council and held various other portfolios in the Gauteng Provincial Government between 1999 and 2011. He will be buried at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg later. Makhura was speaking at Mosunkutu’s Special Provincial Official funeral, in Soweto. “Bra Khabs spoke passionately about fixing the ANC, fixing the country and continuing the revolution. He has continued fighting until the end of his days. He has never wavered when it came to defending the interests of our people. He has never flinched on his loyalty to the people. He has never retreated on matters of integrity. He has never compromised on issues of principle. What a wonderful human being, what a humble revolutionary.” Mosunkutu’s wife has remembered him as a simple and loving husband who put his family first. Nonqaba Mosunkutu told mourners at the Zoe Bible Church in Pimville Soweto, that she has lost a confidant and best friend. Dr Rajohana Matshidiso read out the tribute. WATCH BELOW:
