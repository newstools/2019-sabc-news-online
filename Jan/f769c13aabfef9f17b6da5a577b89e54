Aerial support has again been given after a fire near Gansbaai in the Overstrand reignited in strong winds. At least four houses were gutted at the nearby Franskraal on Friday when flames swept through a caravan park with mostly elderly residents. Helicopters with water buckets and ground crews are currently battling to contain the flames, which are not posing any threat to property at this stage. The road between Baardskeerdersbos and Franskraal has been closed due to the thick smoke which is affecting visibility. Firefighters are also trying to contain fires in Hermanus and Betty’s Bay which flared-up late on Friday afternoon. More than 30 houses were razed in Betty’s Bay in the past few days.
