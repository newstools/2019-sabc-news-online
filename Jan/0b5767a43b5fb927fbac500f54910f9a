GRAPHIC DISCLAIMER: The Following story contains graphic details which may offend sensitive listeners including children. A 30-year old Kwazulu-Natal mother has been arrested and is expected to appear in court on Monday on charges of attempted murder and child abandonment. This after police were tipped off by neighbours who heard distressing screams coming from the woman’s house in Hammersdale west of Durban. It’s alleged the woman was pregnant with twins but only one was accounted for. However, a shallow grave with small bones was also discovered near the woman’s home. KZN police spokesperson, Thembeka Mbhele, says the bones have been taken for DNA analysis to ascertain if they are that of the other twin baby. “Police were tipped off by an old lady who heard a child crying while she was bathing. When she went to the area that’s where she found the child, the child was naked and taken to hospital. On initial investigation by the police it was found that the suspect was pregnant with twins but for now only one baby was found. She was found at the boyfriends place about to leave for the taxi rank to flee the area. She will be facing charges of attempted murder and child abandonment.”
