Banks, schools and businesses remain closed in Zimbabwe, a day after deadly protests erupted over economic hardship and a sharp increase in the price of fuel. Several people were killed and some 200 arrested during Monday’s protests, which followed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s decision to hike the price of fuel by a massive 150%, amid fuel shortages. Mnangagwa left Zimbabwe on Sunday for a two-week trip to Russia and four other countries in efforts to deepen bilateral and economic cooperation. He received criticism for heading abroad, reportedly on a luxury jet whilst the country suffers its worst economic crisis in a decade. Human rights officials have issued a statement that doctors are attending to 26 cases of people who were injured in Momday’s clashes between police and protestors. But as for the numbers of fatalities, it has not yet been released to the public. Click video below:
