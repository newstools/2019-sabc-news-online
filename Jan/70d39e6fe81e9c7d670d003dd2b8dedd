Prophet Shepherd Bushiri will on Monday represent Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) church at a hearing convened by the CRL Rights Commission. The South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) is demanding that the church closes, following a stampede at ECG in Pretoria, that killed three people and left nine others seriously injured last month. These Bushiri supporters are protesting in the Johannesburg CBD. “I am here to support my father, Major 1. What he has done in my life nobody will know. I want justice to be done. We are not fighting, we are here to support him.” “We are here to support our father and we want to expose those people who are jealous of him. I want to ask SANCO why don’t they ask their leader of ECG. It is not Major 1’s duty. He already said sorry for the loss. So what do you want from him? We are here to support our father,” another one added. Prophet Shepherd Bushiri is expected to attend.
