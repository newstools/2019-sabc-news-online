A formal bail application against two truck drivers who are facing charges of assisting undocumented persons to enter South Africa, is expected this morning at the Rustenburg magistrate court in North West. The two are facing an alternative charge of human trafficking, Albert Ngobeni and Uragayi Uragayi, were arrested last month on the old Johannesburg road near Rustenburg, after the police found 16 undocumented Zimbabwean nationals in their truck. The occupants of the truck, who included children, were taken to a place of safety. It’s alleged the truck was on the way to Cape Town. North West Hawks Spokesperson Tlangelani Rikhotso says the arrested truck drivers will appear at the Rustenburg Magistrate’s Court next week Wednesday. “Twelve unaccompanied and undocumented minors aged between three and 15 years have been taken to a place of safety. Two other unaccompanied and undocumented minors were taken with their mothers to a place of safety as well. The rest of the adults were charged under the Immigration Act.”
