The former Bosasa CEO, Angelo Agrizzi,  has confirmed that the facilities and management company paid Minister Nomvula Mokonyane a monthly bribe of R50 000 over a number of years.   Agrizzi is testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture which is under way in Parktown, Johannesburg. Agrizzi says he was responsible for packing the monthly bribes, which the CEO of Bosasa, Gavin Watson paid in cash directly to Mokonyane. Agrizza says he accompanied Watson on occasions when he paid Mokonyane. The former Bosasa COO further says Mokonyane also requested for the company to pay for catering services for the ANC’s rallies. He also states that the company also arranged and designed President Jacob Zuma’s 72nd birthday party and cake.
