The large vegetation fire that has been raging between Pringle Bay and Betty’s Bay in the Overberg for the past six days has now burnt 6300 hectares of land. The fire, which is about 50% contained, has burnt down a house and cottage on a small holding. It was allegedly caused by a flare which was set off illegally on New Year’s Day. A man has been arrested under the Nature Conservations Act, a charge more serious than arson. The fire is now within the Kogel Bay Nature Reserve and has forced the closure of the R-44 at Clarence Drive until further notice. Spokesperson at the incident command centre, Louise Wessels says, “The fire line below the waterfall has now moved down sufficiently so that we can tackle it with some of our strongest ground teams that will bomb that line till it’s out or we can stop it. The rest of the teams are being deployed into the mountain. The fire is still contained within the Kogel Bay Nature Reserve.” See videos below:
