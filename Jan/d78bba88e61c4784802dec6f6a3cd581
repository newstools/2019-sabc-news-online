A number of Zimbabwean nationals living in Cape Town have protested outside the offices of their consulate in the CBD. The group, supported by the Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party, is calling for the resolution of the current government and for the United Nations to urgently intervene following attacks on people protesting against a steep fuel increase. One of the protestors, Richard Vernizo, says the killing of ordinary Zimbabweans is unacceptable. “I’m here as a Zimbabwean citizen. I’m not happy about what is happening in Zimbabwe. They are killing our brothers and sisters. Why did they not intervene in Zimbabwe. They go intervene in DRC, but here we are the next door neighbour. Mnangagwa must step down; he has failed us,” says Vernizo. The Socialist Revolutionary Workers’ Party has condemned the violence in Zimbabwe. The party supported a march to the Zimbabwean consulate in Cape Town. The party says it will mobilise working class communities in South Africa and its northern neighbour to bring about peace and stability in that country. The party says they don’t agree with the slaughter that’s happening in Zimbabwe. They believe that the workers of the world are one. “Imperialism exploits Zimbabwe, they exploit South Africa, and they exploit the Congo. So we’ve got a slogan actually, Congo Zimbabwe South Africa, a working class united will never be defeated.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
