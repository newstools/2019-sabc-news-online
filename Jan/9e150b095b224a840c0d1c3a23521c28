Members of Grain SA have called on government to give clarity on how land expropriation without compensation process will unfold. They say the uncertainty has a negative impact on food security and their financial future. Farmers say the land issue has compounded their problems because they have been battling drought and other economic challenges. “With all the uncertainty and everything that is surrounding that, I need to pay my bills, and I need to pay my people on the farm – and that means I need to plant. It leaves us with a sword hanging over our heads together with all the other stuff. There’s uncertainty, and I wish the government can give us clarity on that, so that we at least know on that in what direction we’re heading,” says Grain SA Manager Jan George Pretorius.
