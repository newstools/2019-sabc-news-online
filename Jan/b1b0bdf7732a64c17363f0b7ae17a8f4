The Independent Electoral Commission(IEC) has called on young people, who are 18-years and older to ensure they are registered to vote. The IEC is reiterating its call for the public to use the last weekend of January on the 26th and 27th to check their registration status at the nearest voting station. The general election is set to take place in May. IEC Chief Electoral Officer, Sy Mamabolo says: ” This is an opportunity for young people, especially those who have turned 18 to come and list so they can have the opportunity to decide the political future of the country.” Mamabolo also says people can go online to check their registration details. “Those that are registered need to ensure that we have their correct address details. That is important because of the decision of the Constitutional Court. We call on every person to either check their address on the online application system or to come to the voting stations.”
