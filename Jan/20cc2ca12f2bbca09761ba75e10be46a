Millions of learners across the country head to class for the first day of school on Wednesday. Briefing the media in Johannesburg on Tuesday, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said they were ready for the 2.3 million learners in the province to kick off this year’s school calendar. About 200 066 learners, who applied in time for grade one and eight, have been successfully placed but parents whose children are yet to be placed remain frustrated. At least 16 000 learners in Gauteng are still not yet placed in schools for grade one and eight classes. A parent, who went to the MEC’s offices in Johannesburg to make inquiries, says they applied online in April last year. She says: “It’s the second time I’m coming because when I checked yesterday it was still pending. I just wanna check why it’s still pending because it’s now January. I need to buy uniform and I need to buy stationary.”
