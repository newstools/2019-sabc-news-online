SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande has called on the ANC to unite its alliance members. “In this province we must also bring to an end political assassinations just because we are fighting over control of resources. The ANC must practice unity. People should stop preaching unity while they are doing things that cause divisions in the organisation.” COSATU president Zingiswa Losi has also praised the ANC for introducing a basic minimum wage. “Knowing that workers will no longer earn less than R3500. It’s ANC government that gave South African workers national minimum wage. Cosatu conference took a resolution to campaign for the ANC in the upcoming elections to ensure that it wins the 2019 elections.” The ANC’s alliance partners were speaking at the party’s 107th anniversary celebrations, underway in Durban. Party President Cyril Ramaphosa is also expected to launch the ANC’s 2019 Election Manifesto.
