The marathon bail hearing in the murder case of former Umzimkhulu municipality speaker Khaya Thobela continues at the Umzimkhulu Magistrateâ€™s Court on Tuesday. The two men who are accused of killing Thobela were initially arrested in May 2017, but charges were withdrawn pending investigations. The charges were re-instated in October last year by the special task team deployed by Police Minister Bheki Cele to investigate political killings in the province. Sifiso Hadebe and Khayalethu Njiyela are facing charges of murder, possession of un-licenced firearms and ammunition. It is believed that Hadebe and Njiyela are also involved in the deaths of two other ANC councillors, Mduduzi Tshibase and Sindiso Magaqa.
