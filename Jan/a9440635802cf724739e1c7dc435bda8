Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has cited concerns over a video of an alleged massacre that supposedly took place in Zimbabwe. Maimane has taken to Twitter, saying his party is currently investigating the footage to verify if the massacre did actually occur.  He has called for further intervention by South African leaders to help end the violence in Zimbabwe. The country has seen chaotic scenes after President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s announcement last weekend of a massive 150% fuel price hike.

He was speaking during a press conference in New York. He says, “We see a huge deficit of trust in governments, political establishments and international organisations. At such times, explanations can sound like excuses and people can become easy targets for nationalists, populists and all those who profit from fear. We strongly encourage the government to be very attentive to the respect of human rights.”
