The Road Incident Management task team says it will embark on a campaign to strengthen its work at the scene of road crashes by implementing stricter rules. This comes after crash victims were identified after being filmed and the video posted on social media before their next-of-kin were notified. Twelve people were killed in a crash involving four vehicles including a truck and a minibus taxi on the N3 near Villiers in the Free State on Sunday. Five people were seriously injured and airlifted to hospital. Chairperson of the Post Incident Assessment team Sipho Towa elaborates. “We have noticed with social media and everyone wanting to take pictures and video of what is happening it is important to introduce screens to cover so that we protect casualties’ identity until their next of kin have been identified.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
