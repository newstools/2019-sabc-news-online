The DA in the Mantsopa Municipality in Ladybrand says it blames the municipality for the water crisis in the area. DA councillor Tania Halse says the situation could have been prevented if water restrictions and regulations were imposed earlier. The municipality has since intensified its water restrictions as supply dams continue to run dry. Halse says the situation is alarming as taps have run dry. She says the municipality neglected to inform the residents ahead of time that they should use water sparingly. “This could have probably prevented us from having such harsh restrictions while in the middle of the school holiday when all guest houses were full and all our resorts were full. It’s definitely having an impact on tourism in the town,” says Halse.
