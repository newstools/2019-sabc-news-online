Justice Minister Michael Masutha has told prisoners to work hard to better their lives. He was addressing inmates of Durban’s Westville Prison who excelled in the 2018 matric exams. Masutha says it is a great pleasure to see young people being passionate about their future. Some of them are now studying with institutions of higher learning. He says: “One of the most important interventions in correcting offending behaviour is the power and influence of education as education shapes how people view the world. It shapes peoples attitude towards life. Over and above that it imparts necessary skills that puts one in good standing.” A total of four DCS schools in Durban Westville, Cradock, Baviaanspoort and Rusternburg Correctional Centres achieved a 100% pass rate. This is a third uninterrupted 100% pass for Usethubeni School in Durban Westville. A total of 28 distinctions were recorded at the school.
