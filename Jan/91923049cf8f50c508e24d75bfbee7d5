The African National Congress (ANC) says the mood within the party is unified and positive in the run-up to the party’s 107th birthday celebrations in Durban. Senior ANC leaders led by President Cyril Ramaphosa are criss-crossing KwaZulu-Natal visiting various communities this week. ANC provincial leaders including chair Sihle Zikalala, Ravi Pillay and some ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) members have joined Ramaphosa at the Masinenge Housing Project in the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality on the south coast. ANC KwaZulu-Natal’s Mxolisi Kaunda says the party is working hard to root-out factionalism. “Building from the renewal in our movement, the area is now stable. There are no longer factionalism occurrences which seek to disrupt the programmes of the ANC.  Therefore, the mood is positive and the spirit of the movement – which the president is going to address, he’s also going to be putting more emphasis on the unity and cohesion of our movement, especially building an ANC which is responsive to the needs and aspirations of our people,” says Kaunda. Ramaphosa also interacted with residents from the Masinenge housing project. This is what some of them had to say about how their lives have changed and what remains to improve. “The informal settlements that we are coming from, it was difficult but we managed to live there. The ANC helped by building these houses for us and it is our wish that the people who are still in the informal settlements would also be given houses. We don’t have electricity yet in the houses and the road is not ready, but we would like to say thank you for what we have received and we know more is coming. We know we will get electricity and job opportunities will open,” says one resident. Click related video below:
