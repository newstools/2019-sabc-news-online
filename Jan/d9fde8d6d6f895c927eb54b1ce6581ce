International Relations Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, says government is pleased that the outgoing DRC President, Joseph Kabila, heeded SADC’s call to hold elections. Sisulu has congratulated the people of the DRC for holding reasonably free and fair elections. The DRC Electoral Commission pronounced Felix Tshisekedi as the provisional winner of the December 30 presidential poll. However, the runner-up, Martin Fayulu has approached the constitutional court to petition it to annul the results. Sisulu briefed the media in Pretoria on Sunday. |”President Kabila was urged from time to time by SADC members to make sure that there is an election, he committed himself and the election was provided for. We wanted some certainty that he would not stand, and finally when we were in SADC in Namibia he did commit that he was stepping down. And these for us are markers of how far we have gone in making sure that we as a region are able to protect the essence of democracy.” Watch video below:
