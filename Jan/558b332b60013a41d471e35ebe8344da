The African National Congress (ANC) says it will not account for party members who acted in wrongdoing or corruption in their personal capacities. The party was responding to allegations contained in the testimony of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi, at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture sitting in Parktown, Johannesburg. Agrizzi said the party allegedly received bribes. He told the Commission that Bosasa, now known as African Global Operations, made a payment to the ANC in the North West, for electioneering purposes. He says the money was requested by an MEC in the province, and was laundered through youth centres to process the payment.
