Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has confirmed to SABC News that his deputy Floyd Shivambu is going nowhere, saying he will continue to be part of the party’s leadership structures. Malema also says the EFF remains united. This is after the reports emerged that there seemed to be tensions in the top EFF leadership. On Sunday,  Twitter was ablaze with many questioning if there was a split in the party, following suggestions that Shivambu planned to join a new party – reported to be established by former Government Communication and Information System  boss and businessman, Mzwanele Manyi. The EFF says it will continue to unite and focus on its mandate, which is to make sure South Africans experience economic freedom. “It is absolute nonsense and rubbish that any of the leadership of the EFF will be resigning to join another political party.” This follows a tweet by party leader Julius Malema where he wrote on his official account, “It is unavoidable; we are heading for a confrontation and fighters you will have to tighten the seat belt. We must have no patience for betrayal.”
