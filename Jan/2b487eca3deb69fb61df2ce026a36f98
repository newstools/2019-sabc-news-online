The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, told her senior ministers she would respond quickly to Tuesday evening’s vote in parliament on her proposed Brexit deal, according to her spokesperson. Asked by reporters if she would quit if she lost the vote, the spokesperson said May is determined to deliver the will of public and take Britain out of the European Union (EU). “The Prime Minister said the government is the servant of the people and she believes passionately that we must deliver on the result of the 2016 referendum. She added that after the vote has taken place, she would respond quickly to the result,” says the spokesperson.
