Market research has shown that as the country gears up to hold national elections this year, the ruling ANC seems to be leading the pack by a far margin in terms of voter confidence. Market research and consulting firm IPSOS, conducted a study between November and December last year. More than 3500 South Africans participated in the survey which found that the ANC was at 61 percent, followed by the DA at 14 percent. The EFF and IFP garnered 9 and two percent respectively. Currently just 79-percent of eligible voters are registered for the elections but that is expected to increase as the IEC embarks on registration drives in the months before the polls.
