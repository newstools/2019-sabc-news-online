Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has welcomed the South African Human Rights Commission‘s report on Klipspruit West Secondary School. The school has been in turmoil since 2017 when the Colored community protested against the appointment of a black principal. The Commission found that the actions of the community were racially-motivated and that there was nothing sinister about the appointment. Lesufi says appointing principals is a major challenge. “I can tell (you),  majority of our schools, when we appoint a principal we spend almost four months before the principal can occupy the post because of complaints, disruptions, people feel its not the right principal.” The community of Klipspriut West has rejected the Commission’s report. Spokesperson of the Greater Eldorado Park Business Forum, Charis Pretorius says the community has always welcomed other races to its schools. She says the commission failed to understand the major issues, including the fact that the new principal and a South African Democratic Teachers Union member on the interviewing panel were neighbours. “What the Human Rights Commission did not get is that the Department of Education failed the people of Klipspriut West when it came to the appointment and training of SGB. It failed them when it came to unions and the role the union has to play in the placement of Ms Makate, and the fact that Ms Magatho and Desiree Levringe, who the branch member are actually neighbours.”  Watch related videos:
