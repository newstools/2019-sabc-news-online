The Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) Student Command in Durban says they are optimistic about the outcome of Monday’s sentencing of the 2016 Fees Must Fall protest leader, Bonginkosi Khanyile. Khanyile is expected to be sentenced in the Durban Regional Court  after being found guilty on charges of public violence, failing to comply with police instructions and the possession of a dangerous weapon. The charges stem from protests at the Durban University of Technology (DUT) during which Khanyile used a slingshot to target police officers. Khanyile initially spent six months in custody awaiting trial, until he was granted bail. The EFF student command’s Lwandisa Khumalo says, “We are very brave and feel motivated. Here we have a case that is going to be concluded. The conclusion of this case will demonstrate or exhibit the type of attitude the SA government has towards us. He is not only popular within the youth, he is also popular with others in the country. There are things that everyone resonates with. Our parents are saying we must go to school. When we get there we have all sorts of exclusions. It’s not a new thing, us fighting for education.”  Watch related video below for more on the story:
