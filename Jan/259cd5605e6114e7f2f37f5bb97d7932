The commission into state capture is set to continue on Tuesday  with more revelations into corruption at state institutions expected. Oral evidence is expected to be heard this week with no witness taking the stand. Last year, the inquiry heard from various witnesses. Finance Minister,  Nhlanhla Nene’s testimony and subsequent resignation was one of the hearing’s most memorable moments. The commission was embroiled in drama like when acting GCIS head, Phumla Williams, told Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo that she received an sms from former GCIS head Mzwanele Manyi. However, Manyi, asked Justice Zondo to reject Williams’s testimony saying it wasn’t the truth. It got more interesting when the-then finance minister Nhlanhla Nene told the commission that he was fired in his first term after refusing to approve projects that would benefit the Gupta family. Public Enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, also gave his side of the story. He told the commission that he learnt through the media that he had been fired.  He said he was not undermining the President when he advised him to follow due process when appointing senior personnel at SOE’s. Expected to appear at the commission in the coming months will be among others, former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor, Duduzane Zuma and President Cyril Ramaphosa. They’ve indicated that they have no objection to testifying before Judge Zondo. Watch video below:
