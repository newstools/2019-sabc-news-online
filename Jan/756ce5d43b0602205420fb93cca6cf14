The African National Congress (ANC) says it will not support sanctions and a regime change in Zimbabwe. The governing party was reacting to remarks by Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane that the ANC cannot be trusted to advance human rights in Zimbabwe. The DA announced on Monday that it will be approaching the United Nations Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court to seek intervention on the human rights crisis in Zimbabwe. ANC Head of Campaigns Fikile Mbalula says his party will not take sides in the crisis. Meanwhile, President Emmerson Mnangagwa is under pressure to deliver on pre-election promises to revive an economy wrecked during the tenure of his predecessor Robert Mugabe, who ruled for 37 years before being forced to resign after a coup in 2017. Mnangagwa’s government has also come under severe criticism for a crackdown on violent protests over a fuel price hike. Mmusi Maimane: Click video below:
