Despite Gauteng achieving the best overall pass rate in the country, Education MEC in the province Panyaza Lesufi believes this is only the start and lots still needs to be done.  Speaking on Morning Live, Lesufi says South Africa’s education system is still far behind. Lesufi says the eventual goal is to get the country’s education system to be amongst the best in the world.  Earlier, Lesufi said his department will continue its move towards a non-racialised education system in the province. Lesufi has attributed the success of the province to his department’s investment in education in townships. “Our education system is like Irish coffee, black and the bottom, white on top with sprinkles of chocolate. It’s a must that our education system should be non-racial. It’s a must that our education system should give opportunities to everyone. It’s a huge task to turn this elephant to face the right direction but we must not lose hope because if you can’t turn this elephant, you are sentencing these young people to poverty,” says Lesufi.
