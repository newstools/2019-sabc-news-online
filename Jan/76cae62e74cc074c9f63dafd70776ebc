Leading Zimbabwean activist, Evan Mawarire has been arrested. He has been accused of organising the protests that turned violent on Monday. Service provider, Econet, confirmed on Tuesday that they cut Internet connectivity after it received a warrant from the Minister of State in the Presidency. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has joined those calling on the Zimbabwean government to reopen the internet. Violent protests have taken over Zimbabwe due to fuel increases of more than 150% with five reported fatalities. HRW wants the internet service to be reopened immediately saying Zimbabweans have a right to access of information. In addition, they say they’ve received information that the lack of connection has affected even medical services. The advocacy group has also received reports of intimidation by police and raiding of homes in Harare. It’s believed more than 200 people have been arrested during the raids. There’s still no word from President Emmerson Mnangagwa who is on a working visit to Russia. Click on the videos below:
