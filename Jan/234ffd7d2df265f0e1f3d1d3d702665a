Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi has revealed to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that some journalists received monthly bribes of R30 000. Agrizzi is continuing to give  testimony at the commission underway in Parktown, Johannesburg. He has told the commission that Bosasa hired media consultants to get rid of negative publicity and to discredit journalists who were writing stories about the facility and management company. Agrizzi says at the time,  Bosasa was facing a lot of negative publicity. Earlier, the Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has commended talks between the commission and SA National Editor’s Forum (Sanef) as positive. Last week, Justice Zondo lambasted the media after sections of Agrizzi’s statement were published in Sunday newspapers, saying it was against the rules of the commission. Sanef subsequently hit back, raising concerns that the rule prohibits journalists from doing their work and accessing information already in the public domain. Justice Zondo commended talks between the commission and Sanef as positive. “I just want to take this opportunity to commend both Sanef and the representatives of the commission who took part in that meeting for the spirit in which I am told the meeting was conducted in regard to the matters that are being investigated by the commission. I am left with no doubt that Sanef is fully in support of the work of this commission and that they do not intend to do anything that would threaten the integrity of the work of this commission.”  WATCH BELOW:
