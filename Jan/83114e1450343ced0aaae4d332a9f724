A landslide crashed into a hotel during a wedding celebration in south eastern Peru, killing at least 15 people, authorities said on Sunday. The mayor, Evaristo Ramos, said about 100 guests had been invited to the wedding party on Saturday and “there are 15 dead and 34 injured.” Ramos said, “The mudslide broke through the walls of the hotel, crashing through”. Firefighters, police and residents worked through the night to rescue people still trapped under rubble, mud and rocks. Civil defense chief General Jorge Chavez said that the dead were 11 women and four men. They did not include the bride and groom, Benedicta Palomino and Bladimir Marquez, who were in stable condition, local officials said. Authorities said the Alhambra hotel was built very close to a hillside. A retaining wall collapsed, and the mudslide brought the hotel roof down on the party goers below, they said. People searching for missing relatives were urged to visit surrounding health centers to find and identify their loved ones.
