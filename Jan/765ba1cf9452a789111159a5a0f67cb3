Fire fighters will continue to monitor the situation on Lion’s Head and Signal Hill in Cape Town after containing a threatening mountain fire overnight. The flames threatened homes on the mountain slopes after igniting late Sunday afternoon. Spokesperson for the Western Cape Local Government Ministry, James Brent-Styan, says fire crews should be commended for their efforts. “This is a testament to the incredible work put in once again on the ground by the firefighters and various entities.  Some of these entities include volunteer firefighters who had to go back to their day jobs on Monday.  Incredible efforts by all these people who continue to go out when called upon.  The efforts will continue on Monday to ensure there are no flare-ups, but we hope the weather stays on our side.”  Click on video below
