Protesters in Lebanon marched on Thursday from Beirut central bank to outside the government headquarters building, as part of the two-week long protests against a political class accused of corruption, mismanagement of state finances and pushing the country towards an economic collapse unseen since the 1975-90 civil war. One protester said they were concerned about “all corruption frameworks” but “most importantly banking policy”. Another protester, Van Meguerditchian said that they believed the protest was “the real chance for the youth of Lebanon”. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri resigned on Tuesday after two weeks of nationwide protests against the ruling elite. People from all sects and walks of life have flooded the streets, furious at a sectarian ruling elite they accuse of plundering state resources for personal gain. The size and geographic reach of the protests have been extraordinary in a country where political movements have long been divided along sectarian lines and struggle to draw nationwide appeal.
