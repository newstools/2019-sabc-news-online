Northern Cape Premier Dr Zamani Saul says the province has managed to attract R23 billion in investment commitments at the recent South Africa Investment Summit held in Johannesburg over the past week. He says the majority of those commitments are in the mining of zinc, manganese and iron ore in the province. Saul says his government must make sure that the province becomes more than just a mineral extraction point for mining companies. “What we have to do as the Northern Cape is to make follow ups on those investments. The minerals, the ore deposits that are exported here in the Northern Cape, they must be processed in the Northern Cape and create work opportunities for the people of the Northern Cape.”
