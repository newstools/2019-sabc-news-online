Zimbabwean government workers are expected to down tools on Wednesday and march against their employer over low wages. They intend to deliver a petition to the Finance Minister. The government workers are demanding better salaries. The workers’ representative body, the Civil Service Apex Council says negotiations with the government were not yielding desired results. However, the government says it is still open to talks. Information Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa says, “Following a statement issued by civil servants that they intend to go on strike to demand a review of their salaries, negotiations have been taking place between the apex council and the national joint negotiating council.” Mutsvangwa says, “In the latest meeting that took place this afternoon (Tuesday), it has been agreed as follows: government does not dispute the need to give a cost of living adjustment to its workers but was faced with various competing national demands.”
