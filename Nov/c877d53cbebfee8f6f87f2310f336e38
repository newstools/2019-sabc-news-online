The African National Congress (ANC) says former State Security minister, Bongani Bongo, is innocent until proven guilty. This is after Bongo appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, on a charge of corruption, and was granted bail of R5000. The charges are in relation to an alleged attempt to bribe Advocate Nthuthuzelo Vanara, the evidence leader of Parliament’s Public Enterprises committee inquiry into State Capture at Eskom, in 2017. The matter has been postponed to January the 31st. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says: “There were media reports yesterday to the extent that Comrade Bongo has been arrested, appeared in court and was out on a R5000 bail. He remains innocent; he continues to remain a member of the ANC NEC. He has said the court process would allow whim space to be able to clarify and deal with all of the issues before the court. It is only fair that we allow that open process.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
