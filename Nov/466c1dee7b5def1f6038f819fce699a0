Members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (NEHAWU ) at the Mapulaneng Hospital in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga have embarked on a march demanding that the construction of a new hospital in the area be sped up. The workers marched to the site where the new hospital is supposed to be built. They say the current hospital is dilapidated and puts the lives of workers and patients at risk. The project started in 2015, but remains in its foundational phase. Provincial Secretary General of NEHAWU, Welcome Mnisi, claims that about R300 million  has been spent so far. Mnisi also says they want security to be beefed up at all health facilities and the lifting of a moratorium on vacancies in all provincial departments. “If you can look at the structure, you can tell that there is money that was spent here, our worry as NEHAWU is what has happened to that money. We are estimating at R300 million  and if it was spent why is this institution not completed?  Remember our task as Nehawu is that where corruption raises its ugly head, that corruption must be uprooted.”
