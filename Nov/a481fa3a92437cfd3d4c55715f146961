Trade union National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa says the leadership crisis at South African Airways is to blame for the workers not receiving their full salaries. Numsa says it has been informed by SAA management that workers were paid half salaries on Wednesday. It says the remainder will be paid on December 2 including their 13th cheques. SAA is still recovering from last week’s eight-day strike action which saw it losing about R50-million a day.
