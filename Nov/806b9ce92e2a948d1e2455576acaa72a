President Cyril Ramaphosa is visiting Lesotho’s capital Maseru on Wednesday afternoon to witness the conclusion of the multi-stakeholder forum which agreed on the reform process needed to be undertaken in the mountain Kingdom. Ramaphosa was appointed SADC facilitator in 2014 following Lesotho’s political instability.  He had since appointed his facilitation team led by former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke.
