Residents in some parts of Modimolle in Limpopo are still experiencing water shortages despite assurances from authorities that the situation is being addressed. In 2018 the area faced threats of a day zero arriving because of low dam levels. The Mdimolle-Mookgopong Municipality has indicated that it’s bulk water supply has been unable to meet the demand, leading to water restrictions. The municipality has also been struggling to service a R10 million debt it owes to Magalies Water. A resident of Phagameng extension 10, George Maluleka, says it’s been hard to sustain his brick laying business due to the shortages. “Shortage of water is a serious problem and my brick laying business is badly affected. Sometimes we can go for a week or weeks without water. We are really suffering. I thought getting a small water tanker will help me, but there is no difference, it never gets full because of low pressure. The government should help us by also providing water trucks this side. ” Limpopo MEC for Cooperative Governance Basikopo Makamu, says the municipality is getting the necessary support to deal with the water challenges. “The challenge of water is a challenge that as a province, we are taking it very seriously. We are working very closely with the municipality. You will notice that this municipality is a water service authority, the grants that are meant for water go directly to the municipality. I have been here before, trying to work with them to support, mainly to provide services because at one time the municipality had challenges. We will be launching this refurbished pump station, which will provide water in the entire Modimolle Mookgopong.”
