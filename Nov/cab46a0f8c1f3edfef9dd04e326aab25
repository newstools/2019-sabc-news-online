The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has raided the offices of the Lepelle Northern Water Board in Polokwane following alleged corruption in the awarding of a tender. The unit is searching for documents related to a multi-billion-rand  Water Scheme which has failed to supply water to about 50 villages around Giyani. The water project was riddled with allegations of corruption and has been inflated to over R2 billion. The SIU’s Kaizer Kganyago says there have been attempts to prevent the unit from acquiring the documents. “We as the SIU have come here to Lepelle Water in order to get documents we need for us to finalise our investigation. We are doing investigations around some of the contracts that have been entered into and we have been trying for a while as SIU to get information from them and we are not getting any joy. The information that we want is why we had to go to court to the get the order to come and search to get the documents that we want.”
