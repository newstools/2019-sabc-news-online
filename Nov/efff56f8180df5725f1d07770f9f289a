Azanian People’s Organisation (Azapo) President Strike Thokoane says it is time for the party to have representatives in Parliament and municipal councils to get a voice on issues that the country is facing. Thokoane has been addressing delegates attending the 24th National Congress at Daku Hall in Port Elizabeth. He has urged delegates to start preparing for the upcoming local government elections after the national congress. “Because we want our voice to be heard and it is heard better when you are in Parliament, we are not going to give up on this goal. That is when we say we have to come back from the 2019 national elections and the next ones are in 2021 and Azapo is trying its level best to regroup and prepare for those elections.”
