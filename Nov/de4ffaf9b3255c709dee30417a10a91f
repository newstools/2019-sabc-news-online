A memorial service for Social Development MEC Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe will be held at the Johannesburg City Hall hall at midday on Wednesday. Nkabinde-Khawe died at the Mulbarton Hospital in Alberton on Friday after a short illness. She was a long-serving member and chairperson of the Social Development Portfolio Committee in the provincial Legislature before she was appointed as an MEC after this year’s general elections. On Tuesday different political parties paid tribute to her at a special sitting in the Gauteng Legislature. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who has been appointed Acting Social Development MEC paid an emotional tribute to his former colleague. He says: “Her departure from our midst is a great loss to the ANC, this legislature and the people of South Africa. She was always inspired by true feelings of love for our people. She also performed her tasks as part of the collective,  inspired by clear ideology to serve our people.” “Comrades and friends, as we bid our beloved cadre goodbye, let’s do so by recommitting ourselves to serve and serve our people well.”
