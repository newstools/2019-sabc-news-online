The KwaZulu-Natal government says it’s doing everything possible to ensure all those infected with HIV are on treatment. The province has the biggest ARV programme in the world. So far, 1.4 million people are on treatment. The province has also reduced mother to child transmission from 18% in 2009 to less than 1% to date. Authorities though are concerned about rising numbers of new infections especially among the youth between the ages of 14 and 25. This despite several available methods of preventing transmission, KZN Acting Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube says: “South Africa has a bigger HIV programme in the world but we remain committed to end twin co-infections that is HIV and TB by 2030.” Related video click below:
