Leaders of religious and faith-based organisations, as well as dignitaries from government, are expected to attend the event.

The Zion Christian Church’s Brass Band will be the first followed by Nazareth Baptist Church Gauteng, Hindu Maha Sabha Band, The Nasheed Group, a band for the Jamiat Ulama SA, United Apostolic Church and Abathandwa. But it is the much-acclaimed Ndlovu Youth Choir, which rose to fame they reached finals of America’s Got Talent in September, who will open the proceeding officially with a National Anthem, before the commencement of prayers or sermons by leaders of religious and faith-based organisations. Pastor Ray McCauley, of Rhema Ministries, His Grace Archbishop Tlhagale of the Roman Catholic Church, Inkosi Sizwe Shembe of Nazareth Baptist Church, Bishop Purity Malinga of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa, are some of the church leaders that are expected to render sermons on the day.
