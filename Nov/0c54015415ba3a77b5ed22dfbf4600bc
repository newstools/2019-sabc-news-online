African National Congress Secretary General, Ace Magashule, says factionalism, disunity and what he terms ‘politics of the stomach’, has led to the total collapse of municipalities in the North West. Fourteen of the province’s municipalities have been put under administration by the provincial government, with the Mamusa local municipal council in Schweizer-Reneke dissolved. Magashule made the comments after meeting with ANC councillors in the North West “If there is disunity you will have municipalities collapsing. If you have unity you will have people working as a team, if you have people who are respecting authority, they also respect the law to govern local municipalities.” “There is no way that you can have 15 municipalities under administration, it’s happening for the first time and it should never happen and that is why we must go back to basics and forget about ourselves.”
