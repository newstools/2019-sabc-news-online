The President of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa), Simon Hlungwani, has called for the removal of the company that is providing security services at the Witbank Hospital in Mpumalanga. This comes after a patient was shot and killed in a ward at the hospital over the weekend. This is the second time a shooting has taken place at the hospital this year. Hlungwani has also raised concerns that a number of similar incidents have recently occurred in different health facilities countrywide. “We call upon the security company that is there to be cut out completely put a new system there. But at the national level, we are still making a call and we have requested a meeting with the minister of health. We are of a firm view that security needs to be enforced in government institutions like it happened in the past for better control and for better training but also to make sure that we are able to make sure that we improve the system because seemingly the private security companies are not providing the necessary apparatus. ”
