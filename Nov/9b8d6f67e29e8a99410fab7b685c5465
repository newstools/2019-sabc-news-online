The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says the death of Social Development MEC Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe will leave a void in the social development sector. The MEC died on Friday night at Mulbarton Hospital in Alberton. Prior to her appointment as MEC after this year’s general elections, Nkabinde-Khawe was a long serving member and chairperson of the Social Development Portfolio Committee in the Gauteng Legislature. The MEC, who was married to the ANC’s provincial secretary – Jacob Khawe, was also the provincial secretary of civic organisation SANCO. Gauteng ANC spokesperson Motalatale Modiba says:”She was very passionate about the down-trodden in society, hence her involvement in various organisations and formations that were involved in grassroots community work.” “Her passing leaves a gap in that sector, and the best we can do is somehow find it in us to be able to continue with the work that she leaves behind.”
