The five learners who died in a road crash outside Monsterlus in Limpopo will be laid to rest on Sunday in a mass funeral service at Kgapamadi village. The learners died after a vehicle they had hitched a lift from rolled several times and killed them instantly. Community members, government officials and scores of fellow learners from local schools are attending the service. The local Kgapamadi Sports Ground is being filled with mourners who came to bid the five learners a sad farewell. The learners, aged between 15 and 18,Â  tragically lost their lives in the middle of exam season. The 29 year-old driver of the vehicle, that veered off the road near a bridge, has been arrested and charged with culpable homicide. Education MEC Polly Boshielo visited the school and homes of the deceased during the past week.
