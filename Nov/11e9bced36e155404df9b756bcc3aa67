Gun Free South Africa is calling on society to support the latest Firearm Amnesty. The Assembly approved the Police Committee report on the Firearm Amnesty Declaration on Thursday last week. Gun Free’s Claire Taylor says the previous amnesty periods in 2005 and 2010 were effective in recovering unwanted and illegal firearms. The National Assembly approved the proposed firearm amnesty period which is expected to kick in on Sunday next week. Taylor says this should also be welcomed by society. “So we could call on all gun owners and families of gun owners to support the national Firearms Amnesty and to use this amnesty opportunity to hand in guns that are unwanted. Guns that are unused, illegal guns and guns that are unauthorised because licenses have expired and not being renewed”. The Police Department says Minister Bheki Cele will hold a media briefing later this week to outline the plans on how the gun amnesty process will unfold. Watch related video below:
