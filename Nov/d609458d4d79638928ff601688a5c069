R25 billion will be invested in the Waterberg District in Limpopo to fast track service delivery in 74 projects, through the District Development Model initiative. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced at the launch of the district model at Lephalale on Tuesday. He says the main focus will be on mining, which accounts for 57% of the district’s economic activities.  Ramaphosa has warned local authorities that action will be taken against those who fail to implement the programme properly. Meanwhile, there is an abundance of coal reserves at Grootgeluk coal mine to support the new multi-billion rand power station, Medupi, at Lephalale, in Limpopo.   President Cyril Ramaphosa said this while addressing more than 4 000 workers at the power station. “Coal is going to continue to play an important role. So, Grootgeluk has more coal. It’s going to support it for another 90 years. So, we are going to have this power station for another 100 years. How do you like that?”
