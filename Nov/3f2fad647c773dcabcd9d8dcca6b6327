A 50-year-old woman is expected to appear in the Bushbuckridge Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga on a charge of murder. It is alleged that the woman murdered her husband who was a member of the South African National Defence Force in the Limpopo province. The deceased was found near the R40 road two weeks ago. Police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says: “Police were called out on the R40 where the body of a man was lying. He was certified dead.” “Through investigations, the wife of the man and her son were arrested. Something did not go right in the son’s and it was not put on the roll. However, we have received a summons to get him back.” The woman will apply for bail on Thursday.
