A Boarder Taxi Association leader in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape has survived an assassination attempt in his home village, Sibangweni. Provincial police spokesperson Thembinkosi Kinana says heavily armed alleged hit-men set alight one vehicle. They damaged six other vehicles including taxis that were parked at the association leader’s homestead. Kinana says: “Unknown men knocked at the man’s house but he did not open for them. After realizing that there was difficulties opening his house they started firing shots at his cars and setting alight one of those cars. As a result six of his cars were heavily damaged.” No injuries were reported and the suspects managed to escape. Police have opened a case of attempted murder and malicious damage to property. Meanwhile on Tuesday a taxi boss was gunned down when he arrived at his home outside Mthatha.
