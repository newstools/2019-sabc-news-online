South African Airways (SAA) has outlined the economic losses it incurred following a week-long strike action by members affiliated to National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the SA Cabin Crew Association. SAA Spokesperson, Tladi Tladi, says millions of rand were lost daily. “What we have gone through is something that is not desirable because at the end of the day none of us is a winner here.” “Those employees who embarked on industrial action were locked out and are going to feel the pinch financially.” “The business also got hurt as we lost an opportunity to trade were in the first two days we lost revenue at an estimated R50 million a day.” The strike ended after a wage agreement was reached on Friday. Workers will get a 5.9% increase and a further 2.1% when the airline returns to profitability. Related video below
