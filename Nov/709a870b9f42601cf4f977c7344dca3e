With just a few days to go to Black Friday and the festive season just around the corner, the South African Police Service says it will increase its deployments to shopping malls and crime hot-spots in an attempt to keep criminals at bay. It has also advised the public to be vigilant when carrying large amounts of cash while shopping, as criminals tend to be on the prowl during this part of the year. Home owners are also urged to take extra precautions when having social gatherings during the holiday season to avoid falling victim to criminals. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says, “With the festive season right on our doorstep, the police will be increasing visibility and deployments at places known as crime hot-spots over the festive season. So, even though the police will be there in and around the shopping malls and banking spaces, we want to advise and encourage members of the public to work with us and minimise the opportunity for criminality.”
