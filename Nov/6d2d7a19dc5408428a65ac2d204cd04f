The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) has rejected the five per cent wage increase offer from companies in the private security sector. The union is demanding a minimum wage increase of R7 500 for Grade C security officers. According to a recent study by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, security guards currently earn between R 4 100 and R5 500 per month.
