The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has warned taxpayers that they risk being penalised if they miss the deadline on Wednesday next week. It says 3.8 million South Africans have already submitted their tax returns, this leaves 1.7 million who are yet to file. SARS Executive for Compliance Farid Khan has this message for those who are planning to evade the taxman. “We know who they are and if you don’t there’s going to be penalties, ranging from R250 a month to R16 000 a month, so it’s pretty harsh. It’s in line with SARS’ strategy that whilst we go out of our way to make easy and remind taxpayers of what their responsibilities are and create platforms for them to comply, we are also going to make it hard and very costly for those who do not comply.”
