Eskom has warned of a high risk of load shedding later on Friday. The power utility says its system remains constrained and there’s a need to continue to replenish its reserves. Eskom implemented Stage 2 load shedding from 22:00 on Thursday night until 05:00 on Friday morning. Eskom says its technical teams are working to return units from planned and unplanned maintenance. The utility’s Dikatso Mothae has urged consumers to use electricity sparingly, and to switch off non-essential appliances. “Please switch off your non-essential lights and non-essential appliances, and as you leave work this evening also please switch off all that equipment that you know will not be used over the weekend, such as faxes and printers and computers.” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan recently announced the Eskom Roadmap – A comprehensive roadmap for Eskom in a reformed electricity supply industry.
