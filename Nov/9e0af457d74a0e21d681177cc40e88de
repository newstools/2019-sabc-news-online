The Bank of Lisbon building in the Johannesburg CBD has been imploded. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department says roads around the building will remain closed for most of the day. Parts of Albertina Sisulu, Pixley KaSeme, Commissioner, Fraser and Helen Joseph streets have been closed off and traffic is being diverted.  In September last year, a fire ravaged the 31-storey building â€“ which resulted in the deaths of three firefighters. The building, which was used to house three government departments, has been found to not meet safety requirements.
