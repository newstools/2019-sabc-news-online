The Gauteng Department of Education has announced that the number of unplaced learners in the province has been reduced to 690 grade eight applicants, as off Friday afternoon. The Department says all qualifying grade one applicants have been placed, a significant reduction from the more than 9 000 applicants that were unplaced a week ago. Spokesperson Steve Mabona extended his thanks to principals for cooperating by increasing capacity in their schools. “The majority of the unplaced learners are from Alberton, Springs, Krugersdorp, Randfontein… in Tshwane, you have Pretoria North and Soshanguve.
We are confident that all these learners will be placed by the 30th of November 2019. We wish also to commend all our principals, more especially in the high pressure areas, who willingly assisted the Department.”
