The world will need at least 264 Billion US Dollars in the next ten years to end preventable maternal deaths, eliminate gender-based violence and harmful practices, and meet the family planning needs of women in high-priority countries, according to new research released in Nairobi on Tuesday on the sidelines of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25). According to the United Nations, currently, only $42 billion in development assistance is expected to be spent on advancing these goals. That means some 222 billion US Dollars in investments is required over the next decade, whether in the form of foreign investment, domestic allocation or private spending and yet achieving these results is a precondition to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. The breakdown of the funds is as follows:     The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem says to achieve these goals countries will need to work together “We cannot wait another 25 years. It’s time to fill these resource gaps and make this a decade of delivery. It’s time to get the job done. With strong financing momentum we can achieve these transformative results, complete the ICPD Programme of Action and meet the Sustainable Development Goals on time by 2030,” says Dr. Kanem. The Summit comes to a close on Thursday.
