Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Health says there’s general support for the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill during its public hearings. The committee is on its way to Springbok where it will start its second round of public hearings on the Bill in the Northern Cape. The objective of the Bill is to achieve universal access to quality health care services in South Africa. The committee called for written submissions from the public on the Bill at the beginning of September 2019. The closing date is the 29th of November, and the committee’s chairperson, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo says they are receiving mixed reactions. “We are getting mixed reactions but predominantly people are in support and want to see this Bill becoming law. Others are saying but this has been talked about for many months, what is happening now? We wish to see this bill becoming law sooner than later. We would have wanted this as of yesterday. Yes there are people who are raising concerns, they are sort of intertwined with what they see visibly on the ground,” says Dhlomo. Watch interview below:
