Naledi municipal mayor Neo Schalk, says those implicated on corrupt activities will be dealt with. He says: “I am going to make sure that we follow up on all these things. I am giving you only three months and will do necessary follow ups. People are getting away with murder.” The municipality is also reported to have not been paying municipal pension funds. Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union’s (IMATU) Ceasar Tlhabi of says: “The pension funds of employees has not been paid to the funds.
