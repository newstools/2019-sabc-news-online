The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has predicted that severe weather conditions are likely to persist in the North Eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday.  This follows a tornado that swept through parts of Utrecht near Newcastle on Friday night.   Forecaster Wayne Venter says at this stage they are monitoring weather patterns closely. “We can confirm that there were damaging winds and tornado in that area last night (Friday). Today (Saturday) again we do expect possible severe thunderstorms; we have to watch out for possible serious storms in that area and in the north eastern parts of KZN again. So people should just be on the watch out that there could be again large hail, damaging winds, heavy downpours which could lead to flooding.” Click on the videos below:
