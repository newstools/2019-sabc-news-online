The criticism of government for the appointment of Andre de Ruyter as the new Eskom GCEO has intensified. The African Transformation Movement (ATM) is the latest party to accuse government of marginalising black executives. Earlier, the ANC youth-wing slammed the appointment as a blatant disregard of black skills and a confirmation of deep-rooted white privilege in South Africa’s boardrooms. However, on Friday, President Cyril Ramaphosa defended the appointment and described the criticism as regression and a slap in the face of transformation. Ramaphosa also said his administration was committed to non-racialism. ATM’s NEC member and head of policy and strategy Mzwanele Manyi says, “People must not confuse multi-racialism with non-racialism. You can have a hundred percent African management and still be non-racial because non-racialism talks to how you treat other people, whether with dignity and respect, regardless of race.”
