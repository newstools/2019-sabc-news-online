The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) says the search is continuing for three missing teenagers who were swept out to sea at Sea Point. The body of one youth was recovered at sea, but three of his friends are presumed drowned. Spokesperson for the NSRI Craig Lambinon says the group from around Green Market Square in Cape Town had just arrived for a swim when a wave swept over them. Lambinon says the focus is now on counseling the families. “The family of the deceased and of the missing 18-year-old are from Burundi, the family of the 16-year-old male and the 15-year-old female that are still missingand they are from the Congo. The chapel services together with disaster management police and the NSRI are assisting the families.” The deceased youngster who was recovered from the sea at Three Anchor Bay has been confirmed as being a 15-year-old boy from Burundi. Police will  continue the search for three other teens who are missing on Monday.
