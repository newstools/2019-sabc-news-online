Mpumalanga Premier, Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, has called on all those who work within the legal fraternity, including the judiciary to come back to the province and foster a rapid change in society. On Friday, President Cyril Ramaphosa officially opened the Mpumalanga High Court in Mbombela, alongside the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Ronald Lamola. Mtsweni-Tsipane says the high court will provide the much needed change in the Justice System. Judge President of the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court, Francis Legodi presided over the first sitting of the High Court in May. He says the official opening of the high court is not only important to the judiciary but also to the residents of Mpumalanga. “The judges will just be here to carry out their traditional functions, but what is very important is how the court will assist people around here – because in the past as you might know the people from around this area had to travel to Pretoria or Johannesburg to access our courts.” The court consists of 12 court rooms, of which currently five are being utilised. Three are for civil cases and two for criminal cases. One additional Civil Court and one additional Criminal court room will also be utilised in the near future.  Additional reporting by Abongile Dumako.
