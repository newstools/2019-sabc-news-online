Parliament’s Justice Committee has resolved that neither Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba nor Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi should be reinstated in their positions at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The committee will recommend this to the National Assembly. MPs deliberated on the fate of the Jiba and Mrwebi after President Cyril Ramaphosa fired them based on the findings of the Mokgoro Enquiry. The enquiry, headed by retired justice Yvonne Mokgoro, found the pair to be unfit to hold office. The recommendation will be tabled before the National Assembly next week. However, Jiba has already informed Parliament that she no longer wants to be reinstated to the position. Click below to watch related videos…
