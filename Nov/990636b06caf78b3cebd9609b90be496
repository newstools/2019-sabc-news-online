Some Members of Parliament are calling on government to immediately declare the drought that has affected many parts of the country a disaster or a state of emergency. Many parts of the country are experiencing water shortages, with cattle and crops failing. This is due to a prolonged drought, which some experts say is the result of global warming and lack of rain. The Agriculture Department says small-scale farmers who have been at the receiving end are reluctant to accept loans that are intended to assist them. Department’s acting chief director Ikalafeng Kgakatsi says: “A couple of years ago during the drought, the Minister was in agreement with the IDC to make money and schemes available at a lower rate that was implemented by Land Bank.” “However the challenge during that time was that farmers that were expected to use that were not really coming forth.” Related video below
