Gauteng Premier David Makhura says his province will support the Xolani Gwala Foundation – that will help those who cannot afford to pay for cancer treatment. The veteran broadcaster was buried at his home town of Impendle, in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, on Saturday. Gwala was granted a Special Provincial Official Funeral by President Cyril Ramaphosa with flags flying at half-mast in the province. Makhura was speaking at the funeral service. “The foundation that the family established to raise awareness of cancer, [Health] Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, this is in your line of work. We as the Gauteng provincial government will work to support this foundation.”
