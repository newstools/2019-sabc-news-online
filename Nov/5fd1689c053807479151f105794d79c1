Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will apply to cross-examine former South African Revenue Services (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane at the Inquiry into State Capture. In a statement released on Monday afternoon, Gordhan says Moyane’s appearance will be a welcome opportunity for him to explain governance lapses at Sars identified by the Nugent Commission of Inquiry.  This comes after Chairperson of the commission, Deputy Chief Justice Judge Raymond Zondo earlier granted Moyane permission to cross examine Gordhan. This is about Gordhan’s previous claim at the commission that Moyane was serving a state capture agenda when he opened a criminal case against him. Announcing his decision, Zondo said that this is subject to Moyane submitting an affidavit in response to Gordhan’s clarificatory affidavit. “Mr Moyane is hereby granted leave to cross examine Mr Gordhan on; a, whether in laying the criminal complaint or charges, Mr Moyane acted maliciously; b, whether in laying the criminal complaint against Gordhan, Mr Moyane was motivated whole or in part by or sort to advance the objectives of State Capture; or c, whether in laying a criminal charges against Mr Gordhan, Mr Moyane was abusing the legal process for his own personal goals, which has nothing to do with the alleged crime.” Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza says, “Mr Moyane welcomes the ruling. He believes that in the end, justice was served after a very long road. As you know, the matter has been before the commission since last year. He applied initially and he was not successful and now his application to cross-examine Gordhan was approved by the chair of the commission. We’re looking forward to Gordhan coming to face the music to defend the allegations that he made against Mr Moyane.”
