Eskom has warned that it will switch off electricity supply to three Free State municipalities, affecting several towns next week if they fail to pay the power utility. Eskom says it has notified Mangaung Metro, Mufube and Mantsopa local municipalities that it will terminate its services as of Tuesday, 3rd of December. The power utility says if municipalities fail to pay or make arrangements for payment, the scheduled cut off supply will start from six in the morning until eight at night throughout the week. Eskom said in a statement that it takes this measure with the intention of reducing the escalation of municipalitiesâ€™ debts. The affected municipalities allegedly failed to honour payments of their electricity accounts.
