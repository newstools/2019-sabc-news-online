President Cyril Ramaphosa has defended the appointment of Andre de Ruyter as new Eskom GCEO. He was speaking at the South African Communist Party (SACP) Fundraising Gala Dinner in Kempton Park on Friday night. The event was attended by several cabinet ministers including Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Minister of Employment and Labour Thulas Nxesi. It was organised to raise funds for the SACP ahead of its elective congress next month.   De Ruyter’s appointment was strongly criticised by the EFF and Trade Union Federation SAFTU, saying it is a regression and a slap in the face of transformation. The ANC youth-wing slammed it as a blatant disregard of black skills and a confirmation of a deep route of white privilege in South Africa’s boardrooms. But Ramaphosa says his administration is committed to transformation. Meanwhile, the President has urged alliance partners the SACP, Cosatu and Sanco to renew and unite the ANC-led alliance in order to create a better life for all South Africans.
