The family of 21-year-old Precious Ramabulana, who was found stabbed in her rented room at Botlokwa, in Limpopo, says they are in disbelief. Ramabula’s lifeless body was discovered in a pool of blood with multiple stab wounds. Her family at Nzhelele, near Louis Trichardt, says she studied at Capricorn TVET college hoping to improve their lives. They described Precious as a selfless person who put her family first. Ramabulana’s uncle, Bethuel says the 21-year-old had future plans, which included building a bigger house for her mother and sister. “The family is currently emotional because of this. Our daughter was the only person who may have changed the circumstance of the family and now she is gone. It was unexpected.” Her landlord, Lettie Masekela says the last time she saw Precious, she was excitedly preparing to study for her exam. For more, watch the video below:
