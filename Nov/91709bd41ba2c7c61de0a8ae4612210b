Former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe said the country needs leaders who will prioritise the interests of society, instead of their personal gain. Motlanthe was speaking during a centenary lecture of Dan Tloome on Friday night in Potchefstroom in North West. Tloome was the former unionist and South African Communist Party (SACP) leader, he has been described as being selfless and committed to serving the people. “For our movement to defeat the demon of factions, for our country to be free of greed, fraud and corruption, for our country to defeat state capture and all its forms to develop and be prosperous and to occupy its pride and space in the community of nations. We need thousands of cadres in the mould of Dan Tloome.” North West Premier Job Mokgoro also lambasted greedy and corrupt politicians. “The rot that has manifested it selves amongst comrades just for power and position in the movement and in government is clearly not what comrade Dan Tloome and his generation had wished for this country.”
