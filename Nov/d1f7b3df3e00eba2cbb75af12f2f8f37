The South African Weather Service says residents should brace themselves as more, heavy rainfall is expected in some parts of Ethekwini Municipality, including Durban, and the Ugu district in southern KwaZulu-Natal for the rest of the day. Consistent overnight rainfall has now led to the closure of a section of the M4 Highway between the Sibaya circle and Umhlanga, due to flooding underneath one of the bridges in the area. Weather forecaster, Julius Mahlangu says more rain is expected. “There’s also some significant rain that has been recorded over in some parts over the interior of KZN. We are still expecting the rainfall to continue today more down pour is still expected over parts of eThekwini and parts of Ugu where we have a warning of heavy rainfall which might lead to localised flooding.”
