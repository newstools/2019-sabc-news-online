A manhunt is underway for a group of armed suspects following a cash in transit robbery in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, Monday night. It’s understood that the cash security van was travelling from Fourways to Krugersdorp when it was attacked by a group of men driving in three vehicles. Only the driver of the cash van was injured during the incident while the other security guard escaped unharmed. An undisclosed amount of cash was stolen before the suspects fled the scene. Police spokesperson Brenda Muridili says: “The suspects with balaclavas placed explosives in the rear of the security van and detonated it. It is alleged that the suspects loaded an undisclosed amount of money into one of the vehicles and they fled the scene.” At this stage the police have not yet made any arrests. “All relevant role players attended the scene to comb it for exhibits,” adds Muridili.
