South African Airways (SAA) has confirmed paying its workers the remaining 50% of their salaries. On Wednesday, the embattled national carrier only paid workers half their salaries, which the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) blames on the leadership crisis at SAA. SAA is still recovering from an eight-day strike earlier in November, which reportedly saw it losing about R50 million a day.  Representatives of SAA and government are reported to be meeting to discuss efforts to secure the airlineâ€™s future. The meeting comes as three insurance companies stop covering tickets issued by SAA following concerns over its insolvency and longevity. SAA has continued to struggle with an unprofitable route network, ageing and inefficient aircraft and a bloated workforce.
