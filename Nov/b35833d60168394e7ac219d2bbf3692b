The BLF has opened a criminal case against Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe at the Hillbrow police station in Johannesburg. The charges stem from reports that Mantashe allegedly bribed two Sunday World journalists not to publish a story over his alleged extramarital relationship with a student. The BLF has also condemned calls from the Economic Freedom Party (EFF) for Mantashe to step down and calls from the Democratic Alliance (DA) for the matter to be investigated, as a deflection from the criminal nature of the matter. The article quotes Mantashe as admitting to bribing the two journalists. Mantashe has since confirmed making the comments but has denied actually paying the bribe.
