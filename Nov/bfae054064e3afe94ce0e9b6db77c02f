The case against Khulubuse Zuma and his co-accused Zondwa Mandela and Thulani Ngubane has been postponed to November 22 by the Springs Magistrate’s Court on Gauteng’s East Rand. The former Aurora heads are facing charges relating to the contravention of the Water Act. The postponement is to allow more for their legal representatives to study the dockets.  The court heard of how accused number two, Mandela, has changed his legal council. The trio are accused of failing to prevent acid mine drainage from contaminating the Blesbokspruit river which is one of the tributaries of the Vaal river, a key water source for Gauteng. Chief legal officer for the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse, Advocate Stefanie Fick, expressed disappointment at the postponement. “This has been dragging since 2010. And we all need to remind ourselves the victims of this that finally people should be held accountable. And the magistrate gave a stern warning that this is the last postponement. Hopefully, by the next occasion, everyone is ready and we can see the trial,” says Fick.
