Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says the country is well on its way to seeing data costs fall. South Africa has some of the most expensive data in the world and due to limited spectrum because of television broadcasting still hogging frequencies. Spectrum refers to radio frequencies needed by cellphone companies to transmit data – currently cellphone companies cannot transmit wireless signals over the same frequencies in the same markets at the same time. Ndabeni-Abrahams said additional spectrum will be released. “I am going to focus on my sector because I want all my people to have access to connectivity – that’s the first thing that we are bringing and those data prices definitely they going to fall. We issued the policy direction, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) issued the information memorandum on Friday – we are kick-starting the process of licensing.
