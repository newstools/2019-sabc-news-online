Four learners at Humansdorp Senior Secondary school in the Eastern Cape were hospitalised after being attacked by an alleged group of juvenile gangsters. The learners, aged between 14 and 18 years, were attacked with knives and pangas. The attackers allegedly barged onto the school premises and targeted the victims. Parents braved the rainy weather to gather outside the school, waiting for their children to finish their exams to take them home. An emotional former SGB member, Christian Munnick, says he is worried about the future of the youth in this community. “I’m so heart sore, it kills me. Our school is now running with gangsterism. Next year my own grandkids are coming to this school. How, when there’s this thing that is happening here? It’s not right. My children and every body in the community is going down. Because of this thing.” Police say they are investigating four cases of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. “Four boys were questioned and released into the care of their parents as they were allegedly part of the fight. Four cases of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm will be opened and will be investigated by the detectives of Humansdorp SAPS,” says Police spokesperson Gerda Swart. Education Department spokesperson, Loyiso Phulumani, says they are conducting an internal investigation. The school will also continue with exams.
