The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is expected to introduce new voter registration devices that will help keep records of voters who have already cast their votes. This will ensure that people vote in the correct constituency. The IEC says this will be an additional mechanism to that of the indelible ink and replacing the outdated Zip-Zip device. During the May national elections, complaints were lodged over people who were allegedly able to remove the ink and vote again. Speaking on South African Broadcasting Corporation‘s Radio News TruFm Current Affairs midday show, IEC Chief Electoral Officer, Sy Mamabolo says the new system will tighten security. “These devices are intended to be used on the Election Day on a light voters’ roll basis, to ensure that we are able to record people who have already voted and possibilities of allegations of double voting. Of course, we want South African companies to respond to this tender and hopefully, come in at reasonable prices. Because, as you know, all of us are in a depressed fiscal stage as a country, but we are intending to make this investment in order to ensure that our elections improve in terms of their integrity.”
