President Cyril Ramaphosa is later today expected to launch of the Waterberg District Development Model in Shongoane village near Lephalale in Limpopo. The first phase has been launched in the Eastern Cape. The Waterberg district is home to many coal mines and the two Eskom power stations, Medupi and Matimba. President Ramaphosa will first conduct a walk-about at the multi-billion-rand Medupi power station. He earlier said that the pilot project would bring development close to the people. “We’re working comrades to provide decent affordable housing in areas that are close to economic opportunities. Earlier, we met with the makhoshis of this area and one of the makhoshis said to us the town must come close to us, and I could not agree more. Comrades this fits in well with our rural development strategy to spread throughout the country.”
