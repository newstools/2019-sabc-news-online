Preparations are in place for the special official funeral of the late AmaXhosa king Zwelonke Sigcawu at Nqadu Great Place in Willowvale in the Eastern Cape on Friday morning.    The king passed away two weeks ago at the Nelson Mandela Academic hospital at the aged of 51. The military has spent hours rehearsing for the official funeral. Seven marquees have been erected to accommodate thousands of mourners. Military Marshall, Lulamile Nontshinga says they’re well prepared. “We as the Defence Force, we are responsible for the military theme. The bikes are for the Military Police who are actually responsible to escort the coffin; also, the very important, people that will be in attendance. They are also responsible for the controlling of people that will also be coming in. I can confirm that we are ready,” explains Nontshinga.
