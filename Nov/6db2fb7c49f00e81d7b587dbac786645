Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Member of Provincial Legislature Makashule Gana has outlined the changes he believes should be made in the party including the need for them to focus on economic, social and environmental justice. This is in the lead up to the party’s Federal Council meeting this weekend where a new leader will be chosen. Gana hopes to replace former leader Mmusi Maimane who quit the party last month.  He will be going head to head with DA Parliamentary leader, John Steenhuisen. Gana says he believes he has gained enough experience to prepare him for the role. “I believe that with everything that has happened in the last few weeks, the DA needs a new direction, it needs to start focusing itself on issues of justice – especially economic, social and environmental justice in order to build them into SA. I believe that with the qualities that I have gained over the 17 years I have been a member of the DA, a Councillor, DA youth leader, in Parliament, I have gained enough experience to prepare me for this particular role. “
