Western Cape Minister for Transport and Public Works, Bonginkosi Madikizela, says he finds it strange that trains are only being attacked and torched in the Western Cape and not in any other provinces in South Africa. He was speaking at Cape Town Train Station, which was closed off completely earlier Thursday morning, after 18 train carriages were destroyed in a fire. The station has since been reopened and Metrorail is currently operating limited train services in the region. Madikizela spoke to the media earlier, “I find it strange that the law enforcement agencies and intelligence does not know what is happening. I find it strange that it’s happening in the Western Cape only, it’s not happening in other provinces. So there must be people who are aware of what’s happening. It’s really surprising that no action has been taken about this,” explains Madikizela.
