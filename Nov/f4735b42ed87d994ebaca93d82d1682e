Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says e-tolls will not form part of the Moloto Road which will be improved and expanded in the near future. He was speaking as he handed over the road to the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) at a sod-turning ceremony in Tweefontein near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga. The R7-billion project is expected to reduce fatalities on this notorious road linking the provinces of Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. The road is notorious for its high number of fatal crashes. This week, two people were killed and more than ten others injured when a bus in which they were travelling in lost control and overturned. “No it does not mean that the e-tolls are not important. I am not venturing into that topic for now. The point is that it will not be tolled. And it will be developed to the standard that will make it much bigger and safe for our people,” says Mbalula. The expansion of the Moloto Road will create up to 12 000 jobs over a period of five years. Sanral CEO Skhumbuzo Macozoma is confident that they’re ready to take up this massive expansion project.
