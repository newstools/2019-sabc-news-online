The Economic Freedom Fighters  (EFF) says it will field a candidate for the mayoral position in the City of Johannesburg. The election of a new mayor to replace mayor Herman Mashaba will take place on 28th November. The election of the first citizen of Johannesburg will depend on the partnerships that parties in the council will manage to form as none can run the council on their own. The party held a press briefing where among others it has outlined its preparations for its second National People’s Assembly Conference from the 10th of next month. For more watch video below:
