KwaZulu-Natal residents are urged to remain on high alert amid another warning of severe storms that might be accompanied by heavy rainfall on Thursday across parts of KwaZulu-Natal. As the province enters day six of extremely inclement weather conditions, the end is not yet in sight. Two people have been killed after a tornado ripped through the New Hanover area in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, two people died when their homes collapsed on them in Inanda and a child drowned in a river in KwaDukuza. Weather forecaster Ayanda Nsele says: “For Thursday we are expecting an 80% chance of showers and thundershowers. Most of the areas that will be affected will be the Central parts and Eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal. At the extreme Western parts of KZN we are expecting 60% chance of showers.” “As of Thursday we have issued out a warning for severe storms that might be accompanied by heavy rainfall leading to flooding of roads.” “We expect fast-flowing rivers so people should not cross low lying bridges.” Full weather report below
