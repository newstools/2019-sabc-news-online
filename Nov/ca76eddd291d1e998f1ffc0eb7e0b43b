SA Rugby says it could send the Webb Ellis Trophy and a couple of players to visit provinces not included in the Springboks World Cup victory tour. The Boks have visited Joburg, Pretoria and Durban and have arrived in East London for Saturday’s tour before travelling to Port Elizabeth on Sunday and Cape Town on Monday, where they’ll also be hosted by parliament. Northern Cape Premier, Zamani Saul, has expressed dissatisfaction with the exclusion of the Northern Cape from the Boks tour. “It can’t be that when there are such critical events happening in this country we get excluded, that is the struggle which this generation of ours we should wage, and when we wage that struggle we should wage it forcefully without fear or favour to make everyone in South Africa to appreciate the fact that Northern Cape is one of the provinces of South Africa. And in the Northern Cape we’ve got people here who also aspire to be part and parcel of the new dawn which is articulated by the president.” Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, has thanked the people of eThekwini in Durban who came out in numbers to honour  the Springboks. Thousands of people, young and old brought the city to a standstill brandishing flags and banners honouring the Boks. Their victory tour in Durban ended with a media briefing at the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium. Zikalala says the Boks proved to the world that the country can overcome the battles of the past and succeed if there is unity. “In particular we appreciate and thank the Springboks from the coach, the captain and all the players for the job well done, let’s give them a big round of applause. We must thank the people of eThekwini who came out in numbers to join us today and make this a big success.” Watch related video:
