A nanny accused of the murder of a baby under her care has abandoned her bail application. Mannana Tsabane has been accused of the murder of 20-month old Langelihle Mnguni. She abandoned her bail application at the Benoni Magistrates Court, East of Johannesburg on Friday. The toddler’s body was found inside one of the rooms in his parents’ house after the nanny allegedly murdered him. Her case will resume in the same court on December 10th. The Daveyton community has welcomed Tsabane’s decision to abandon bail. Community member Phindile Macamo says: “At least it worked out, we can see the light now if bail was not granted it means they took into consideration all necessary investigations because we don’t know the root cause of the whole thing; we can assume it’s the lady but there might be someone behind it. So I’m relieved they are taking into account all investigations, we are just hoping for the best, that justice will be served.”
