Five suspected rhino poachers have been arrested at the Kruger National Park’s Malelane section in Limpopo. SANParks spokesperson Ike Phaahla, in a statement, says that the suspects were found with two fresh rhino horns, a high calibre hunting rifle and poaching equipment at the weekend. Their arrest follows the discovery of two rhino carcasses covered with grass and twigs – apparently to hide and delay their discovery. The suspects were travelling in a kombi. They’ll appear in court soon. Graphic courtesy of savetherhino.org
