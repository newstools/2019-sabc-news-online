Former president Jacob Zuma is headed to the Pietermaritzburg High court on Tuesday where he is expected to apply to have the civil defamation case, brought by former Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, struck off the roll. The application comes after Judge Dhaya Pillay at the Durban High Court ruled in September that Zuma’s tweet was unlawful and ordered him to remove it from his twitter timeline within 24 hours of the ruling. Zuma had posted on his twitter account that Hanekom is a known enemy agent. It’s unclear at this stage if both Hanekom and Zuma will be present in court.
