The African Development Bank will on Monday host the second edition of the Africa Investment Forum. The 3 day event will be held at the Sandton Convention Centre north of Johannesburg. The Forum launched last year in South Africa and will be attended by various African presidents, investors businesses and experts. It is expected to attract more Foreign Direct Investment into the country- which will greatly benefit President Ramaphosa’s investment drive. Last year, eight Heads of State attended the event, which closed 45 bankable deals on the continent worth $32 billion. A total of 6,8%of that was transferred into South African projects – mostly in energy and transport. This year the forum plans to secure the participation of more African Heads of States in an effort to attract more investment deals. The 2019 African Investment Forum comes on the heals of president Cyril Ramaphosa’s South Africa Investment Conference which saw R365 billion worth of investment commitments made by big and small businesses.”
