Walter Sisulu University in the Eastern Cape has been re-accredited with the Bachelor of Law degree. The Council of Higher Education withdrew the university’s accreditation in 2017 after discovering that the institution hired under-qualified lectures and lecture halls were not conducive to teaching and learning. University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo says: “We have worked very hard as the University to make sure that we fix those things that were identified as deficiency to allow us to be able to be re-accredited for our LLB program.” “We are extremely proud of the team that has worked tirelessly to make sure that we get re-accredited for our LLB  so the new package or the new re-design LLB program has indeed addressed those major deficiencies that were found lacking. We’ve professors now, we’ve got  improved curriculum as well.”
