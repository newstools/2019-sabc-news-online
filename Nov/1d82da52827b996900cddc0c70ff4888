Civil rights organisation, AfriForum, has indicated their willingness to work with the police in investigating the murder of Bafana Bafana captain, Senzo Meyiwa. The goalkeeper was shot dead five years ago at a house in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg.  It was alleged Meyiwa was killed in a botched robbery. He was gunned down in the presence of his girlfriend, Kelly Khumalo, and family members. The National Prosecuting Authority has yet to make any prosecutions in the matter. AfriForum CEO, Kallie Kriel, says the head of their Private Prosecutions Unit, Gerrie Nel will work with police on the matter. “We dont want to take over the police’s job, we are saying we will assist. And any information we do find we will share with the police, Then the first people that should do the prosecution is the NPA and we would support them in taking this on if they want to prosecute. Adv. Nel has been appointed as the advocate for the Meyiwa family and we will monitor the process. If we believe there is a strong case and the NPA does not act, then we can go down the route of private prosecution.” Watch related video:
