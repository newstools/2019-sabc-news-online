The SA National Editor’s Forum (SANEF) has welcomed the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board’s assurances that the SABC will never spy on its journalists. This follows a Sunday newspaper report alleging the public broadcaster wanted to, quote “ask spooks to spy on staff” over the alleged leaking of sensitive board information. SANEF has applauded the SABC’s undertaking that it will never place journalists under surveillance. However, SANEF says while it recognises the public broadcaster’s right to protect its image and interests, it remains concerned about the possible involvement of the State Security Agency at the SABC.
