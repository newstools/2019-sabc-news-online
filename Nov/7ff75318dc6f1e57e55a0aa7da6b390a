The South African Police Service (SAPS) has dismissed weekend newspaper reports that have claimed that the death of the former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was a cover-up. Meyiwa was shot and killed in 2014 at the house of Kelly Khumalo’s mother in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg. The Sunday newspaper reported that Meyiwa was accidentally shot by one of the people present at the house; it further claimed that lead investigator Colonel Bongani Gininda withheld crucial statements during initial investigations. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo says, “The National Commissioner, even the Minister, have come out publicly to say that they are satisfied with the work that has been done.” “Colonel Gininda and his team only got the docket last year, 2018, and have been working tirelessly on this docket. Rather than put out speculations, innuendo’s, half-truths and cause so much uncertainty, rather come forward with positive and constructive information that can help us to investigate this case successfully,” says Naidoo.
