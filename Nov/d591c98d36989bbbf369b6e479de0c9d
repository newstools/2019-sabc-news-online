One thousand women from across the continent are converging on South Africa from Monday for African Women in Dialogue, talking about women empowerment, and peace and security. The event is organised by the Zanele Mbeki Development Trust and runs from the 4th to the 8th of November under the banner “Women’s Voice and Power as Agents of Change”. Event  co-ordinator, Linda Vilakazi, says the dialogue was started by key South African women who felt that there was no platform for African women to meet and engage on how to move the continent forward. “We launched the event last  year November with a thousand women. At that point because of the shortness of the planning we could only bring women from 16 countries and it went well. This year we are meeting for the 1st time with women from all 55 countries  in Africa ” For more watch video below:
