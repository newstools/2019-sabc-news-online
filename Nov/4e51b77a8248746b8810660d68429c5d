Tunisia’s next government should focus on reforming the faltering economy and restoring hope among frustrated youth, the prime minister designate said on Sunday. Habib Jemli faces the challenge of creating a ruling coalition in economically troubled Tunisia after the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, which took most seats in last month’s election, tapped him as prime minister on Friday. The birthplace of the Arab Spring, Tunisia is the only country to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy following the 2011 revolts that swept autocrats from power across North Africa and the Middle East. But many governments since then have failed to resolve economic problems, including high inflation and unemployment that has bred discontent especially among young people. “It will be last chance for the revolutionary process,” Jemli said. “Tunisians were patient enough and the youth are frustrated. It is time they can see hope and light at the end of the tunnel.” Priorities will be to combat price inflation and to improve Tunisians’ living conditions and public services.
