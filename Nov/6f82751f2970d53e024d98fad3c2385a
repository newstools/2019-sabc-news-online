The election of a new mayor for the City of Johannesburg has been postponed to next Wednesday and Thursday. Speaker Vasco Da Gama will seek legal advice on how the process will take place. The council was expected to elect a new mayor following the resignation of Herman Mashaba. The Economic Freedom Fighters has nominated its regional leader, Musa Novela, as its mayoral candidate. The Democratic Alliance, which currently leads the coalition government in the city, has nominated Finance MMC Funzela Ngobeni. The African National Congress has nominated Geoff Makhubo as the party’s mayoral candidate for the city. Discussions on possible coalitions were already taking place at the city. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule says talks in politics will always take place – telling the media that they are talking with the EFF as well to find a way that will see progress in the city of Johannesburg. Magashule says however political parties must not count their chickens before they hatch. “Well in politics you talk to different parties. Whether they agree or disagree, but you try and engage anybody for the sake of the city. And therefore such discussions will continue to take place. That is why we fielding our own candidate.”
