The World Champion Springboks will visit parliament in Cape Town on Monday as part of their victory tour of the city. On Sunday the Boks toured Port Elizabeth – the home town of skipper Siya Kolisi, as well as Coach Rassie Erasmus and Backline coach Mzwandile Stick. The Springboks have apologised to residents in the northern part of the city as they had to cut their visit short to make it to the airport on time to fly to Cape Town. “First of all we are really excited as South Africans to see the Springboks live – and as you can see that there’s a lot of fans here right now supporting us,” says a Bokke fan. The Springboks will embark on the final leg of the nationwide trophy parade in Cape Town on Monday.  Watch video below for more on the story:
