Some residents in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria who have not had water in two weeks have resorted to digging wells to access water. Residents living in the area were left without water after lightning struck a transformer servicing one of the water waste treatment plants. The Tshwane Metro has made water tanks available, but residents say the water tanks do not meet the communityâ€™s needs. A resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the situation has compelled them to find alternative means of accessing water. Residents said that the reason that led them to dig the wells was due to a shortage of water in their area. WATCH
