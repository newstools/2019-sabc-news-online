The woman accused along side businesswoman Bridgette Radebe of money-laundering has been granted bail by a High Court in Gaborone on Friday. Welheminah Maswabi is accused of being a co-signatory with Radebe to bank accounts that fraudulently moved money across borders. The South African businesswoman is alleged to have used the money to assist former President Ian Khama in an apparent regime change plot. However, there’s been no evidence presented so far. Last month, Bridgette Radebe spoke out denying all allegations. Last week the Central Bank of Botswana, local banks Nedbank and ABSA dismissed the existence of those said accounts that were allegedly used to move almost 10 Billion dollars out of Botswana. Radebe says she is going to sue those who have accused her. Watch video below:
