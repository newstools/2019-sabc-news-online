Workers’ trade unions have warned that the spate of job losses and retrenchments is a ticking time bomb. Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) say they are concerned about possible retrenchments at South African Airways, Eskom, the Post Office; and job losses in the steel, financial and mining industries among others. Cosatu’s Parliamentary Liaison Officer Matthew Parks and Western Cape SAFTU Deputy President, Nyaniso Siyana have rejected that retrenchments and downsizing will cut the fat and bring profitability. “We have been telling government to shift workers to critical positions; education, health, SARS. Retrenchment is not a solution. We were in this situation years ago and SAA retrenched workers, but look now, it hasn’t solved anything.” Watch video for more:
