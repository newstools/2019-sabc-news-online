Former British Labour MP, Lord Peter Hain has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa and the South African government to act swiftly in making sure that all those identified at the State Capture Commission are brought to book. Speaking at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg,  Hain says he understands that South Africa has limited resources, and the public purse is under enormous pressure – but action must be taken.  The South African-raised politician has told the commission that it would be of global significance if the South African government were seen to be acting against corruption. “Particularly its president whom I admire so much, Ramaphosa, is respected across the world is president Ramaphosa. I just wish they could act quickly and I hope that might be something that your commission could investigate. I just re-enforce the need for levy on global corporate given the lack of resourcing and resources that they are for the public purse in South Africa,” says Hain. The State Capture Commission will resume with testimony from the Reverend Frank Chikane, among others.
