Deputy President David Mabuza will be back in the National Assembly this week after last week’s oral reply session was postponed. This is the second last week of Parliamentary sittings before the National Assembly and the NCOP adjourn for the December recess next week. Mabuza will be back in the Assembly on Wednesday for his last oral reply session for this quarter. Parliamentary Committees are expected to conduct their usual oversight over department and state owned entities this week. Ministers in the Governance Cluster will answer questions on the same day.  The embattled South African Airways is expected to dominate debates in Parliament this week. The National Assembly will debate an Inkatha Freedom Party Motion of National Importance on SAA on Tuesday. The SAA Board and Management are expected back in Parliament to meet with SCOPA on Wednesday. SCOPA says it will continue with its planned meeting with or without the co-operation of SAA. The committee met with SAA last week. It was unhappy that SAA it failed to submit the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 financial statements to Parliament as required by law.
