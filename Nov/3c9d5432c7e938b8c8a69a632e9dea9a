Namibia’s incumbent President Hage Geingob has thanked his supporters for re-electing him. He has taken to Twitter to express his gratitude. However, the country’s Electoral Commission has not finalised the results. It says 80% of results for National Assembly and Presidential races have been collated. The former South African colony went to the polls on Wednesday. Geingob and his party South West Africa People’s Organisation (Swapo) were expected to secure majority wins. He  tweeted: “I am humbled and commit to serve the Namibian nation with more passion and utmost dedication.” Congratulatory messages have started streaming in from his supporters despite an official announcement not yet being made. The Electoral Commission says out of the 121 constituencies, 108 have been collated for the Presidential election. Geingob is sitting at 56% and the next candidate is only at 28%. The National Assembly numbers see Swapo at a two thirds majority with 66%. Swapo has been the ruling party winning with outright majorities since the country’s independence in 1990.
