Former Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he has mixed feelings about leaving the job, this is after he quit following the ascendancy of Helen Zille in the Democratic Alliance. A new Johannesburg Mayor will be elected on Thursday. The Economic Freedom Fighters has nominated its regional leader, Musa Novela, as its mayoral candidate. The African National Congress is yet to name its candidate. The DA, which currently leads the coalition government in the city, has nominated Finance MMC Funzela Ngobeni. Mashaba says his aim was to serve the residents of the city. “What a sad, emotional, mixed emotions day for me. It is unfortunate, I would have loved to have finished my term, for two years to serve our residents. I joined to serve the public office and the residents – not to serve political parties. Once you try that with me and expect me to serve political parties, this is not negotiable.” Watch for more:
