The Western Cape Department of Environmental Affairs says that while they’re pleased with the overall average dam level in the province, the Gouritz River catchment area is a point of concern. The latest average dam level for the Western Cape is 65.1%, the City of Cape Town’s dams are on average 82.6% full and the Gouritz River catchment area is averaging just around 17.7%. Department spokesperson, James Brent-Styan, “We do still remain massively concerned about the northern parts of the west coast as well as the internal parts of the province around the Karoo which is known as the Gouritz river catchment areas. That region hasn’t seen rain for 3-4 years. Historically that region does get rain in both summer and winter months so we hope to see some relief in the coming months but it remains unpredictable and uncertain.”
