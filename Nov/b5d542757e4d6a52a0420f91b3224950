 Opposition parties in the North West have raised concerns about the general performance of the province’s municipalities. Last week, MEC for Local Government, Gordon Kegakilwe gave a report that performance of municipalities has declined since 2016. About 13 municipalities have been placed under administration since last year for poor performance and political interference. “We feel that municipalities like that of Kgetleng, Ngaka-Modiri Molema, Bojanala were supposed to be part of those municipalities that are put under Section 139C of the Constitution,” says Shakes Botswe, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader. “There is a lot of maladministration and unauthorised expenditure, which means there’s a lot of theft in our municipalities. Furthermore, I think the infighting of members of the ruling party is making things worse,” says Winston Rabotapi, Democratic Alliance (DA) caucus leader.  Watch a related video below:
