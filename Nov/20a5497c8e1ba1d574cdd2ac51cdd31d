The National Consumer Commission (NCC) says consumers who have been affected by Ford Kugas that caught fire in 2015, have three options for compensation. The NCC has fined Ford Motor Company South Africa R35 million regarding its Ford Kuga 1.6 Eco-boost saga. NCC Acting Commissioner Thezi Mabuza says they have reached an agreement with the motor company for consumers who have been affected to receive redress. In 2015, more than 40 Ford Kuga SUVs caught fire forcing the American car manufacturer to recall the model. The NCC says it had received 160 complaints from consumers against Ford. Head of enforcement investigations at the NCC Prudence Moilwa breaks down the compensation options. “The first option is to give the consumers R50 000 over and above the settlements that have been done before, you can look at it as a gesture of goodwill, let’s say for emotional or whatever it is that the consumer might have suffered.” “And the second option over and above the R50 000 where consumers are able to prove that they have suffered some form of damages and the court will be able to settle over and above the R50 000. The third option is one where the consumers rejected the first and second option that they can still go to court and reserve their right to claim with a civil court.” Related video click below:
