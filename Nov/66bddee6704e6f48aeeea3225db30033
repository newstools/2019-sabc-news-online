Mokgweetsi Masisi will on Friday morning be inaugurated as Botswana’s fifth President. He follows in the footsteps of Sir Seretse Khama and Sir Ketumile Masire. They have all led the landlocked country since it became independent from Britain in 1966. Masisi’s rise to the top seat has been marred by controversies, as a result of a fall out between him and his predecessor, Ian Khama. Last week, the BDP that has governed Botswana since 1966, won 38 parliamentary seats, while the whole opposition won 19, in the fiercely contested elections in the history of Botswana. Masisi has promised to hit the ground running after having been elected to become president of the landlocked country. He first occupied this position last year, taking over from Ian Khama, whose term was about to end. In Botswana, the sitting president hands over presidency to their deputy, a year before the general elections. Masisi’s inauguration come at a point that the main opposition party alleges that elections were rigged. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
