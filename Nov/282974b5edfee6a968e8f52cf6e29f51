Umgeni Water has denied reports that its infrastructure is unable to manage high water levels after this week’s rains or that infrastructure has been damaged. Umgeni Water Spokesperson, Shami Harichunder, says the week’s persistent rains have had no effect on their ability to supply the public with water. He has also rejected reports that some water pipes ruptured and burst due to high water volumes. “We are aware that there is some concern being expressed by people that the infrastructure that Umgeni Water operates such as pipelines and water treatment plants may have been damaged during the floods of this week. That is not the case we just want to assure our customers that the infrastructure that Umgeni Water operates and uses to supply water has not been affected in any way by the floods or heavy rains and the storms. We are able to continue to supply water to all our customers without any concern about a reduction in supply, we have sufficient water available,” says Harichunder. Watch a related video below:
