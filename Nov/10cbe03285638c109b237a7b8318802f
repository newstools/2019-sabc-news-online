Sweltering heat in the Mpumalanga lowveld has prompted authorities to encourage people to frequent various swimming pools in the area to cool off. The high temperatures began on Thursday and are expected to end on Sunday. The South African Weather Service has warned residents to stay hydrated. Some street vendors have taken advantage of the heatwave by selling frozen juice at busy streets intersections in Mbombela. One of them, Xolani Mgwenya, says his business is booming. “My business is going well here. if it is busy, I make R800, R400, R300 during the week. It’s nice but it’s dangerous because it’s not safe. Mbombela (Municipality) … they don’t want us to sell here.”
