Residents of Golf Course settlement at Alice in the Eastern Cape are fuming after a promise to fix their shoddy RDP houses has not been realised. They were demolished due to poor workmanship, but now still lie unfinished. It’s alleged that a contractor was appointed to rebuild them, but has now left the site. Residents allege they’ve been waiting for six years to have them fixed and their patience has run out. Thokozile Phiyiwe, who vacated her house, wishes she did not agree to have it fixed. “Not having a house while you used to have one is very painful. Yes, the houses were not in good condition and we want them to be fixed. When I pass by my site my heart becomes very painful because I know I used to have a house.” Human Settlements Spokesperson, Masiza Mazizi says the MEC is aware of the matter and it will be resolved soon. “She doesn’t want for now to respond on this matter. She has sent a team of officials to investigate this matter. She has written to all the regional directors to give us reports of all these projects across the province. So, that two-day meeting will be convened where she will be able to discuss with her team, discussing each project, each challenge and its way forward thereof.”
