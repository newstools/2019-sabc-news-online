Police say they are trying to establish the motive for the attacks in an incident where a 22-year-old man allegedly killed his mother and his four-year-old sister, and injured his two siblings by stabbing them in Sebokeng in the Vaal on Friday. He faces two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. The Sebokeng community has been left in shock following the incident. The suspect is in hospital under police guard after he allegedly stabbed himself. National Police Spokesperson Vish Naidoo says the motive for the attacks will form the basis of their investigations. “It’s too early to pronounce on what the motive is. We have some theories that we are exploring extensively and of course, we will need to have those theories to formulate a formidable prosecutorial case against the suspect. Should he be charged, we will then pronounce on what exactly the motive was. I think it’s a bit too early to give any indication of what the motive was,” says Naidoo.
