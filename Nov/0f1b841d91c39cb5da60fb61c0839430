Black First Land First consciousness – pan-Africanist and revolutionary socialist political movement and former political party – says it may consider amending its constitution to accommodate white people. Andile Mngxitama founded the movement in 2015 after being expelled from the Economic Freedom Fighters. The Independent Electoral Commission deregistered the movement as a party after the Freedom Front Plus appealed against its registration because it excluded membership based on race.  The movement’s Deputy President Zanele Lwana says they can accommodate whites if they agree with the movement’s mandate. She says some members want the organisation to be turned into a Non-Governmental Organisation. “If we do amend the constitution of our movement, whoever wants to join our movement will have to agree with key issues such as, ‘I agree that black people were dispossessed by the white people minority (sic) and will continue to be landless in this country.’ For as long as you then agree with these preconditions that even the country indigenously belongs to black people then we are willing to consider a situation where we allow membership … for as long as you agree with the policies and mandates of Black First Land First.”
