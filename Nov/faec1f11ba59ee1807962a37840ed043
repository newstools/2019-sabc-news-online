Police in KwaZulu-Natal have confirmed that the story making rounds on social media of police officers donating food parcels to the family of a 13-year-old girl living in poverty are true. The story has gone viral with many social media users applauding the officers for their kind gesture. According to police the teen lives with her grandmother in the rural area of Umbumbulu, south of Durban. She had travelled to the city to ask for money from her mother but instead she was allegedly chased away. The teen was then forced to seek assistance from police. Meanwhile, Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu, has pledged government’s assistance to the family. Sisulu has described the incident as tragic and says her department will send a team to meet with the area’s Ward Councillor and will also engage with the Department of Social Development so that the family is registered for government assistance.
