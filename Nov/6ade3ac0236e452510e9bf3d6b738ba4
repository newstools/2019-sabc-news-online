Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has advised that government – as a South African Airways shareholder – not get involved in matters relating to the strike faced by the national carrier. Employees affiliated to NUMSA and the Cabin Crew Association are striking over a wage dispute, among other issues. BLSA CEO, Busisiwe Mavuso, says the SAA board is accountable for the ailing state-owned enterprise. “It is the Board that is charged with the duties to ensure that these organisations are run the way they are supposed to be run. It is the Board that is going to be held accountable. So shareholders should never get involved in the issues of salary disputes and the issues of operations… they have nothing to do with them. When you look at SAA, this is an ailing organisation that is at the brink of collapse. Demanding that Board signs off the 8% increase to employees doesn’t generate enough income from operations. I think is tantamount to the Board being derelict of their duties,” says Mavuso. Watch related video below:
