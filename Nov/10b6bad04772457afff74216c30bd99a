The scheduled oral reply session for Deputy President David Mabuza will no longer take place on Thursday in the National Assembly. Parliament says in a statement that Mabuza will not be in the House as he is currently playing a role of mediator in South Sudan. Parliament’s Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says Mabuza had to undertake an official trip to facilitate the second round of consultations and mediation with the signatories to the Revitalised Agreement on the Conflict in South Sudan. He says the Deputy President’s apology for not coming to Parliament has been received by National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise. This would have been Mabuza’s third oral reply session for this quarter before Parliament rises for the December recess in two weeks’ time. Mothapo says the next date for the Deputy President’s next oral reply session will be determined by the National Assembly’s Programme Committee.
