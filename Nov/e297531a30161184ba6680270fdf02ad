Former president Jacob Zuma will not be appearing before the State Capture Commission as scheduled next week. The Commission has released a statement saying it has been informed by Zuma’s lawyers that the former President is ill and will not be able to appear as expected between the 11th to the 15th of November. Zuma was expected to testify on a number of issues including allegations about the failed nuclear deal with Russia, why he had fired finance ministers Nhlanhla Nene and Pravin Gordhan and his relationship with the late Bosasa CEO, Gavin Watson. Zuma had claimed that the State Capture Commission is being used to destroy his reputation. His lawyer once threatened that Zuma would withdraw from the Commission over claims of unfairness. However, Justice Raymond Zondo was able to secure an agreement from Zuma’s legal team that they will continue to participate. Related video click below:
