Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has warned public representatives to restrain themselves within the confines of the executive code of ethics. Mkhwebane was reacting to the High Court ruling which dismissed an application by former Western Cape premier Helen Zille to review an adverse report about a colonialism tweet. The Public Protector found in June 2018 that Zille’s controversial colonialism tweet was in violation of the executive code of ethics. Mkhwebane says the High Court’s verdict has vindicated her stance that Zille had failed to act in a manner that was consistent with the integrity of the high office she occupied. “The code is very clear; as an executive you need to conduct yourself in a way that you are above standard. So you cannot come and justify colonialism, you cannot come and justify the oppression of other people. “It’s not about me, it’s not about my credibility … it’s about dignity of our people.”
