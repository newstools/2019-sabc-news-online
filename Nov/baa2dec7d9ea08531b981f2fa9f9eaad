Political parties in Parliament have come out in support of an equity partner for South African Airways (SAA). During a debate on the impact of the strike at the airline last week, parties said it was unsustainable that the taxpayer continues to pump money into the entity. Khaya Magaxa of the African National Congress (ANC) told the House that it is not fair for the taxpayer to continue to support the elite who use the airline. He says the money should rather be used to support trains, buses and taxis which are used by the majority. “We may not always agree with the Finance Minister but the recapitalisation of these SOCs that continue to have bloated executive with the layers of managers with executive packs, managers who award dodgy contracts is morally very difficult to justify. Government must seek to find partners with aviation expertise to buy equity in SAA so that it can continue to fly the South African flag. We can’t continue subsidizing the rich.” Watch Parliament debate on SAA below:
