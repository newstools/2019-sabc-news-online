Convicted racist Vicki Momberg has handed herself over to the police in Douglasdale, north of Johannesburg. Momberg has been on the run for weeks after she failed to hand herself over to police in August to start her prison service. Her bid to appeal her conviction and two-year prison sentence failed. She was found guilty for using the K-word 48 times while referring to a black police officer in 2016. Police Spokesperson Mmathapelo Peters says, “Police can confirm that Ms Vicki Momberg on Wednesday 06 November 2019, handed herself over to the investigators at Douglasdale SAPS after a brief consultation between the police and her legal representatives. Police have processed Ms Momberg and she will be handed over to the prosecuting authorities at Randburg Magistrate’s Court.”
