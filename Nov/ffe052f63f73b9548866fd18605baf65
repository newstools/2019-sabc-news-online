The Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department says the death toll in KwaZulu-Natal has risen to 20 following inclement weather conditions that started last month. Some roads were washed away, bridges and houses damaged or collapsed following two tornados as well as heavy rains.  Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has assured those affected that her department will do its best to assist them. Department Spokesperson Lungi Mtsali says: “Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has put together a response unit working together with the province of KwaZulu-Natal to ensure that we have a coordinated approach on how we deal with the inclement weather we have been experiencing.” Watch the video below for related news:
