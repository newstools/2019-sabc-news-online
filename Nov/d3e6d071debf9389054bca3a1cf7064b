Eskom says there is likely to be no load shedding for the remainder of the weekend. The power utility briefly implemented stage two load shedding after it lost three generating units and had to use emergency reserves to meet the demand. Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says things should be fine this weekend. “We do not think that we will need to go into load shedding. We believe we have enough emergency reserves to carry us through and adequate capacity outside of the reserves as well. We are looking much better than we were yesterday (Friday) and should things remain the way that they are, we will not load shed over the weekend.”
