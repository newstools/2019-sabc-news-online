Eskom says the system remains constrained and vulnerable…however no load-shedding is expected this week. However, it says the generating plant is performing at very low levels of reliability. The power utility says load-shedding will only be implemented when necessary. Deputy Spokesperson for Eskom No load, Dikatso Mothae has urged consumers to use electricity sparingly, and switch off non essential appliances. “We are currently not using our emergency reserves which is a good sign. Currently are running on normal generation capacity to meet demands which is good. Things continue as they are or improve, we do not believe that we need to implement any load-shedding this week.”  Click related video below:
