The Eastern Cape Department of Health has expressed shock at the stabbing and killing of a patient at All Saints Hospital in Ngcobo over the weekend. Two men are alleged to have had a quarrel and one of them was rushed to hospital with stab wounds; while nurses and doctors were attending to him, a knife-wielding man arrived, threatening security guards, nurses and doctors, wanting to attack the patient. Provincial Health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said, “Security guards had to run for their lives, the doctors had to run for their lives. It’s a very painful experience that they were exposed to. These are hospitals that are supposed to provide health to the people.” “At the time of the incident, we had deployed a total of 10 security guards in various areas within the institution. We urge the Department of Justice to send a clear message to all criminals and would-be criminals that government will not tolerate any act of turning hospitals in this country into war zones,” added Kupelo.
