The Water and Sanitation Department says the recent rainfall has not made any difference to water levels in the Vaal dam. The persistent high temperatures and low rainfall has seen water levels continuing to decline in the Vaal Dam. The Cities of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni are urging residents to continue using water sparingly as the demand for water rises. Rand Water which supplies water to Gauteng and other neighbouring provinces has implemented Stage 2 water supply restrictions due to declining water levels at reservoirs. Water and Sanitation Department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says, “The rainfall over the last few days has not made any difference to the dam levels especially when people are looking at the dam levels at the Vaal. The Vaal Dam is continuing to decline.  The appeal still remains let us be conscious and conservative in how we use water.”
