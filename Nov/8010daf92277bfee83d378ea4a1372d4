The strike at South African Airways (SAA) could soon be over. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) will hold a media briefing in Johannesburg on Friday. This follows reports that the union and the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) have reached an agreement with SAA after lengthy wage negotiations. According to the reports SAA management has agreed to postpone retrenchments until further notice. SAA has also agreed in principle to establish a task team to review contracts and procurement issues at the airline. The task team will play a major role in looking at how to save costs at the embattled airline. As our reporter Amina Accram reports it is yet to be confirmed if SAA and unions have reached an agreement in principle. The agreement is yet to be signed by the SAA board and its shareholders. According to reports, SAA and unions have agreed to pay 5.9% wage increases by February next year – with the extra 2.1% to be paid through the work of the task team. SAA under business rescue Earlier on Thursday trade union Solidarity served court papers on the embattled South African Airways and the Ministers of Finance and Public Enterprises. The union wants the court to put SAA under business rescue. Another union, Satawu, said it had received its strike certificate to join the stoppage.
