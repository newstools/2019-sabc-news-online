A man accused of causing the crash in which Deputy minister of Mineral resources Bavelile Hlongwa and three other people died two months ago is on Monday expected to apply for bail at the Temba magistrate’s court North of Pretoria. Hendrik Brits’s legal representative earlier failed to show up in court. He is facing four counts of culpable homicide and reckless driving. His truck ploughed into an accident scene killing Hlongwa who had just stopped to assist a motorist whose vehicle overturned on the N1 in Hammanskraal. A group of ANC Women’s League supporters are expected to attend Monday’s bail application.
