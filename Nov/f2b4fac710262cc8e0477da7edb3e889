The North West Legislature Portfolio Committee on Local Government and Premier Job Mokgoro, seem to be in dispute regarding the decision by Mokgoro’s administration, to dissolve the Schweizer-Reneke based Mamusa municipality. The municipality was recently dissolved, reportedly after failing to provide residents with basic services. The portfolio committee argues that constitutional procedures were flawed. Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee, Aaron Motswana says they also believe the decision was politically motivated. Motswana says, “Before you can come to the level of implementing section 139, the constitution requires as a province that you had provided support to a particular municipality and such a municipality has not shown ability to  rise from the problems that exists in those particular municipalities. This action of 139 1.C is punitive, it is being done to advance political scores and it is not intended to actually correct the situation at the municipality.” The office of the North West Premier has refuted all the allegations. Spokesperson for the Premier, Vuyisile Ngesi says the decision was based on the failure of the municipality to carry its constitutional obligations. Ngesi says, “The executive council was of the view and the firm conviction that the council of that municipality had neglected their constitutional obligations completely and there was a complete collapse of service delivery in that municipality. Though we had already invoked section 139.1.B, but clearly things were not getting any better. Therefore there was a need for us to invoke 139.1.C. We are confident that we followed all the necessary constitutional requirements.” Click below to watch related video:
