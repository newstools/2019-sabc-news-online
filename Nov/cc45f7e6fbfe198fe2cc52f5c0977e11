Limpopo African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson Stan Mathabatha has urged municipalities to accelerate the delivery of basic services and desist from corruption. He was closing the ANC local government summit in Polokwane. All the 27 municipalities in the province obtained unqualified audit outcomes for the 2017-18 financial year. Mathabatha also says that ANC deployees should intensify their fight against gender-based violence. “We’re saying we shouldn’t be absorbed by the sick society that encourages gender violence that kills our children, that we’re hearing about in the newspaper; the Zondo Commission.  A corrupt society is a sick society; we can’t afford to have an ANC that is absorbed in a sick society.”
