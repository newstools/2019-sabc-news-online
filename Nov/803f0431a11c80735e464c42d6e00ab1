The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has come under heavy criticism from Parliament’s NCOP committee deliberating on the five worst municipalities in terms of irregular expenditure incurred in the 2017/2018 financial year. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has incurred irregular expenditure amounting to R12.3 billion for the financial year. Chairperson of the NCOP Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Thamsanqa Dodovu says this amount is nearly equivalent to the budget of the municipality. He’s lambasted the municipality for what he described as lack of consequence management. “This is an indictment, this is serious, this is a sad episode of what is actually developing in Nelson Mandela Bay. It doesn’t show that this irregular expenditure that occurs year in and year out is being addressed.” OR Tambo District Municipality, Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, Matlosana Local Municipality, City of Johannesburg Metro and Mogalakwena Local Municipality are the five worst performing. Chief Director at Treasury, TV Pillay says consumers owe municipalities billions of rands. “There’s probably over R150 billion sitting in the outstanding consumer debtor book. Now R150 billion it’s bad news, R150 billion in debtor’s book not collected which means R150 billion not put into infrastructure or services.” Meanwhile, Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Mayor, Mongameli Bobani claims the visit of World Rugby Champions Springboks to the city is the reason he failed to come to account before parliament about the city’s irregular expenditure. The Boks will be in Port Elizabeth and surrounding areas on Sunday. Andile Lungisa tendered the mayor’s apology.
