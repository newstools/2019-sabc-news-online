The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo is holding a two-day local government summit to discuss ways to improve the poor state of municipalities in the province. The summit has brought together party and municipal officials. Deputy Ministers, Obed Bapela and David Mahlobo, from Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs and Water and Sanitation, are also in attendance. Limpopo ANC chairperson and premier, Stan Mathabatha has spoken out strongly against poor performing municipalities. Mathabatha says the senior officials should face the consequences in poor performing municipalities. In the 2017-18 audit report, all the 27 municipalities received poor audit outcomes. Mathabatha says municipalities with disclaimer audit outcomes could be hiding corrupt activities. “Once a municipality gets a disclaimer it says you don’t care about those people that you’re leading or else there’s corruption. If you get a disclaimer and you’re a chief financial officer you must also consider yourself disclaimed.  As a mayor if you get a disclaimer go straight to those people and consequence management and disclaim them,” says Mathabatha. ANC provincial secretary, Soviet Leganyane concedes that municipalities in the province are collapsing. But Lekganyane believes the summit will come up with ways to improve the situation. “We’re doing a collective assessment of the system of the local government in the province but to help inform the national leadership of what’s happening in our province. Apart from lamenting on the conditions which are prevailing of a collapsing state of local government these are the suggestions that provinces are making to help restore the confidence of our people in the system of the local government,” says Lekganyane.
