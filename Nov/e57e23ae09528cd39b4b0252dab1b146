The strike at SAA is over with all parties signing a wage agreement in Johannesburg on Friday. The CCMA says in a statement on its website that the wage dispute between SAA and unions, the Cabin Crew Association and NUMSA, has been resolved. The increment will be paid in two stages. The parties agree to an increase of 5.9% on total cost of employment retrospective to 1 April 2019, which will be paid in the February 2020 payroll, subject to availability of funding. The back payment for the first 6 months (April to September 2019) will be paid in the March 2020 payroll. The remaining 4 months (October 2019 to January 2020) back pay will be paid in the April 2020 payroll.  The CCMA has praised the parties for remaining in the mediation process. Cabin Crew Association deputy president, Christopher Shabangu has been interviewed on the SABC’s TruFm Current Affairs show. “You are the first station to know that we have reached an agreement with the SAA about the eight percent increase and we have agreed that part of that 8% will come from the suggestions of the unions which are going to be implemented through the task team, which is going to start next week. We have always believed that since 2015  this airline makes money, we are grateful right now that now we are given an opportunity to show what we meant when we say the airline has money, particularly if they don’t sabotage the task team that we are now starting.” See the details of the agreement on the document below:
