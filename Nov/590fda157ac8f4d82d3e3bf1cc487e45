Police in Gauteng have confirmed that they’ve been struggling to locate convicted racist Vicki Momberg since a warrant for her arrest was issued in August. In June this year, the High Court in Johannesburg dismissed Momberg’s appeal for her conviction and two-year sentence. She was given 30 days in which to apply for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein and report to the Randburg Magistrate’s Court but she failed to report to the court, prompting officials to issue the warrant of arrest. The former real estate agent was sentenced to an effective two years in jail last year after she was found guilty of crimen injuria for using the k-word at least 48 times against a black police officer who had come to her aid, following a smash-and-grab incident in Johannesburg in 2016. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says officials are yet to locate her. “Police are yet to locate and arrest Ms Momberg as per a warrant of arrest that was issued a couple of months back. Police have since on numerous occasions visited two addresses, one in Bedfordview and one in Krugersdorp, with the last visit as recent as this past week. And Ms Momberg was not at either of these addresses. We have a responsibility as the police to execute this warrant of arrest, therefore our investigators will continue to trace Ms Momberg until she’s found,” explains Peters.
