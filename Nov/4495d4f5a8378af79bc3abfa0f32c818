More than 250 children have died in Gauteng due to gender-based violence over the past five years. Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko revealed this in a written reply to a Democratic Alliance question in the provincial legislature. This as South Africa observes the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign. In the same period, over 130 000 gender-based violence cases have been registered at various Gauteng police stations. Of these cases, more than 44 500 arrests have been made with only 9 786 convictions. Gauteng DA shadow MEC for Social Development, Refiloe Ntshekge says, “The conviction rate is at a staggering 22% which is a very low arrest rate. This is a let down to the women of Gauteng and I will be following up with MEC Faith Mazibuko to understand why so many cases don’t result in arrests being made and why the conviction rates are so low.” Watch for more:
