The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it will press on with its hate speech complain against Springbok lock, Eben Etzebeth over an alleged racial slur.  This is despite his lawyers’ attempt to get the matter withdrawn, alleging that commission is biased. The Khoisan Defiance Campaign lodged a hate speech complaint with the HRC following an alleged racial slur made by Etzebeth outside a pub in Langebaan in August. The commission, however, says it is filing papers in the South Gauteng High Court. Legal opinion on the matter was presented to commissioners on Monday. Etzebeth wants the court to review and set aside the commission’s decision to institute proceedings against him in the Equality Court on behalf of four people. They are suing him for over a million rand. He has denied the allegations. Andre Gaum says legal opinion on the matter has been presented to them. “In terms of the rule of court we need to file a record of proceedings today, after that Mr Etzebeth will have an opportunity, the applicant in the matter will have the opportunity to look at the record and decide whether or not to supplement is court papers , and after that we will have an opportunity within 15 days to decide”
