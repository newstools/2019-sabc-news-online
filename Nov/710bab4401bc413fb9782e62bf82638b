The Black First Land First (BLF) movement has described the de-registration of the party as an insult to black people. The BLF applied to appeal the Independent Electoral Commission’s (IEC) de-registration, which was later denied by the Electoral Court in Bloemfontein. The movement was de-registered after the Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) lodged a complaint with the court, because of its stance on excluding people based on race, colour or ethnicity, which goes against the IEC’s constitution. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama reiterated that the de-registration does not spell the end of the party, which is expected to hold a Special Policy Conference at November 30, 2019 in Durban. “It’s an insult to black people, not just to BLF… I mean, we as black people need to take ourselves seriously. We are going to go to this conference and look at options. We are not going out of the political system. It is only going to make it easier for land thieves. We want a pro-black constitution in the political arena in this country. It has been stolen from black people and we need to get reparations over and above the fact that we need to get our land back.” “The reason why we are banned, quite frankly, is because the FF Plus knows that BLF is the only movement that can force the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) – these parties that have a 2/3 majority in parliament – to address the land question,” added Mngxitama.
