President Cyril Ramaphosa says that existing laws on bail and sentencing are being reviewed to ensure that those facing gender-based violence charges, are not easily granted bail or given light sentences. He was responding to the demands made by women in the country. “To ensure that those found guilty of gender-based violence receive punishment proportionate to their crimes we are in the process of reforming existing laws around bail and sentences; this is in response to the demand that was made by women of our country who complain that those who are found guilty are often given bail very easily and those who are sentenced are given light sentences and we agree that there should be no bail for people like that.” Ramaphosa was launching the annual 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children at the Witpoort police station outside Lephalale in Limpopo. This year’s campaign is themed “Enough is Enough: 365 days to end Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF)”. For more watch video below:
