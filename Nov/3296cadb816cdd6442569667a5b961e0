University of Cape Town  Professor Lynette Denny has used her award of the prestigious Medical Research Council Gold Medal to again make a plea for greater awareness of cervical cancer and the fact that it is preventable through mass screening. Professor Denny has been working with poor women for the last 25 years that have been battling the disease.  The medal recognises her as an outstanding South African scientist, whose research has raised the profile of science in the country. In a statement, Professor Denny says cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the country, after breast cancer, yet it is preventable through mass screening.
