There are renewed calls for political tolerance after an African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) member was shot dead and another injured in Pretoria. The family of the slain ANCYL member from Mamelodi, Pretoria, says they are  shattered following the murder of 25-year-old Lethabo Nkoane. Nkoane was fatally shot during an ANCYL meeting in Hammanskraal, North of Pretoria. Another ANCYL member, Michael Kotiti, was also shot and injured during the incident and is recovering in hospital. Nkoane attended an ANCYL meeting which turned violent. The gathering was convened by the National Youth Task team. Its aim was to facilitate provincial and regional meetings to assess the state of the organisation ahead of Congress in 2020. Family representative Psychology Lethuba says: “The family is very shattered by the news that we just received and we are trying by all means to just grieve and we will just request to be given that space to grieve for Lethabo Nkoane. He was a loving person who loved the ANC and cared for people.” ANC members sent condolences to the grieving family. Nkoane’s murder again highlights political intolerance in the structures of the ANCYL. This comes weeks after ANCYL members set alight vehicles in Polokwane Limpopo during one of the Task Team meetings.
