Pope Francis offered his prayers on Sunday for the victims of violence in Ethiopia. Addressing thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square, the pontiff expressed his closeness to the head of Ethiopia’s Christian Orthodox church, Patriarch Abune Mathias. “I ask you to pray for all the victims of violence in that land”, Pope Francis said. Violence along ethnic and religious lines remains a big challenge for Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous nation.
