The SABC has sent its condolences to the family of its former Group Chief Executive Officer, Solly Mokoetle, who died on Friday. He had been battling ill health since last year. Mokoetle joined the SABC in 1994 as a general manager and became the corporation’s Chief Operations Officer from 2001 to 2006. He later re-joined the SABC as the GCEO in January 2010, prior to the delivery of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. SABC Spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo says: “The SABC is saddened by the passing of its former CEO Solly Mokoetle, who played a very important role to the development of the communication industry over the years. Mr Mokoetle was very instrumental to the delivery of the 2010 FIFA World cup broadcast, among many other things he was involved in, and the successful broadcast of the 2010 FIFA World Cup is really testament to his commitment to fulfill the SABC mandate of building an informed society.
