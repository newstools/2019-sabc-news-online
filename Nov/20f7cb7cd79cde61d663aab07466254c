South African Airways (SAA) says all passengers affected by the cancellation of flights due to the workers’ strike, have until November the 30th to re-book their tickets or finalise a refund from the airline. SAA will on Sunday resume flights from the OR International Airport to New York, Sao Paulo, Hong Kong, Perth, London, Frankfurt, and Washington. The embattled national carrier has been in CCMA mediated talks with the South African Cabin Crew Association and trade union NUMSA regarding the wage dispute and looming retrenchments. SAA management has requested that the National Transport Movement join the wage talks. SAA employees who belong to the unions embarked on a strike, which started on Friday, demanding an eight per cent wage increase –  while SAA is offering five-point-nine per cent, depending on the availability of funds. SAA spokesperson Tladi Tladi says however, that domestic and regional flights remain suspended. “For Sunday and for Monday, for domestic and regional segment of our route network, the flights that are SAA operated remain cancelled. However, as of Sunday evening, SAA will reinstate the international service, that means we’ll start operating flights from Johannesburg to various international destinations and from Monday; we’ll then start operating from those international stations, back to Johannesburg.”
