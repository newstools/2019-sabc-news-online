Gauteng premier David Makhura has utilised the opening ceremony of the Africa Investment Forum underway in Sandton to showcase economic opportunities that the province has to offer. Speaking to delegates, the premier has urged investors to continue investing on the continent, particularly in SMME sector and youth in business to unleash the power of the small micro enterprise. More than two thousand delegates have registered for this year’s forum from 109 countries- 48 from African countries. “As Gauteng province, it’s an honour and privilege to be the host of this premier investment platform on behalf of South Africa, and indeed on behalf of Africa. The Gauteng city region is the 26th largest urban area on the globe, with 15.2 million residents; we are South Africa’s economic hub. We are a prime destination for foreign Direct Investment. The Africa investment forum is making a direct contribution to South Africa’s efforts and drive on investments particularly in infrastructure investments.”  Click link for more on the story”
