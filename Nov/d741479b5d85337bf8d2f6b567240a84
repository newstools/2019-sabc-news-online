Daily commuters in New Delhi have become the primary victims of toxic smog that has plagued the Indian capital and nearby areas for days. Air quality on Friday was deemed “poor” according to the monitoring index. The Delhi government announced a health emergency in the city and advised people to stay indoors and shut schools after an increasing number of people reported respiratory issues and irritation in eyes and throat. Authorities in the Indian capital banished cars with number plates ending in an odd number  in a bid to reduce the pollution, although politicians in the city of more than 20 million people, bickered over the causes of the pollution and who should take the blame for it. Some commuters said public transportation is becoming infrequent due to poor visibility on road which leads to crowded commutes and delay in reaching work.
