Eskom says it hopes Thursday’s meeting with Free State Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs will yield positive results and it will not have to cut electricity. The power utility announced on Monday that it is intending to cut off electricity to the Mangaung Metro as well as the Mantsopa and Mafube Municipalities. Eskom says Mangaung owes R170 million while cash-strapped Mafube at Frankfurt owes R52 million. It says it is owed R205 million by Ladybrand’s Mantsopa. Eskom Free State General Manager for Operations Klaas Gouws says they want the municipalities settle their debts. “We are going through a process in the amounts that is outstanding, we expect the municipality to pay that to avoid us switching off on 3 December.”
