The Equality Court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, north of Johannesburg, is on Tuesday expected to rule on whether the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) will go ahead with the case of crimen injuria against Adam Catzavelos. This relates to a video that Catzavelos recorded in which he used the K-word while he was on holiday in Greece last year. Catzavelos’ representation to the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions for him not be prosecuted, has been unsuccessful. His legal counsel then told the court that they were to approach the National Director of Public Prosecution to request that the matter be dropped. In August, Catzavelos reached a settlement agreement with the South African Human Rights Commission in which he  agreed to pay R150 000 over 30 months and to apologise.
