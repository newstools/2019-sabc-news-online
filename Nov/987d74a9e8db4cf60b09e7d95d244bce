The Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) Tshwane Caucus has submitted an urgent motion of no confidence in Tshwane mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. The EFF says the City of Tshwane has been limping from one disaster to another since Mokgalapa took office. The party says the DA administration has proven to be incapable of resolving the City’s service delivery issues. The EFF has cited the escalating water crisis in Hammanskraal, the deterioration of fiscal and procurement management standards, and constant power outages in various areas as reasons for its decision. The motion of no confidence will be tabled at a council meeting on Thursday. Click below to watch related videos….
