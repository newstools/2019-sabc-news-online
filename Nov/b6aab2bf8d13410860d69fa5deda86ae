Efforts to free FeesMustFall activist Khanya Cekeshe are continuing. Hundreds of people under the #FreeKhanyaCekesheMovement marched through the streets of Pretoria to hand a memorandum of demands to Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola.   They are calling for the unconditional release of Cekeshe and the removal of criminal records incurred by other activists as a result of the 2015/2016 FeesMustFall protests. Cekeshe is serving an eight-year sentence at the Leeuwkop Correctional Centre after pleading guilty to setting alight a police van during FeesMustFall protests in 2017. Convener of the movement, Eva Tembu, says the granting of Cekeshe parole is long over-due. “He didn’t commit a crime, he didn’t kill anyone, he was just fighting for a good cause of which is free education and government promised that. From where we are standing, they are just playing politics, because most people align it with the EFF and the government is the ANC, so from where I’m standing, ANC is playing politics. People on the  ground are suffering, students are suffering, they’ve been punished for something they don’t know.”
