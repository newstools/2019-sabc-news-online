Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union( Popcru) is demanding the removal of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Union President Zizamele Cebekhulu has accused Mboweni of advocating for policies that he says, are contrary to those of the the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies. The Finance Minister has warned that South Africans need to tighten their belts and also to pay for services they use. Cebekhulu was addressing the union’s national congress in Durban . “He swam up stream earlier in 2019 when he took an arrogant point against the proposed removal of Gauteng e-tolls systems.  This was against ANC formal structures. In the same way Mboweni introduced papers as what happened in 1996 when GEAR was introduced by Trevor Manuel and he further emphasised that these papers are non-negotiable papers. This what his predecessor has done. And they are telling us in the face that you can go to the elections, all ministers can belong to you, but this one doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to a particular control. This is what we want to say to the President that Tito must go.”
