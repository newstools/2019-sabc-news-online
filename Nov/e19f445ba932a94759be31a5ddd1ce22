Learners at A.M Mashego Secondary School at Monsterlus, outside Groblersdal, in Limpopo where five learners were killed in a road crash on Tuesday are reeling in shock. The five died when the car they had hitchhiked home from school veered off the road and rolled several times at a local bridge. The learners were aged between 15 and 18. Some of their classmates had this to say: “A lot of learners come from other places other than Monsterlus so it must have been scary for them as well.” Another one says, “We are very sad at the school because those girls were very well known and it is tough to see that just a distance to go home there is this much danger that can harm us as students.” “In our class we lost a classmate. So it won’t be the same because we used to laugh and hang out together,” remembers a classmate. Limpopo Education MEC, Polly Boshielo says the untimely death of five learners from the school is devastating. Four were in grade eleven, while one was in grade nine. Boshielo visited the school and the homes of the deceased on Wednesday. “It was very sad because the four of them were identified by the question paper of the exam they were writing. It were writing agriculture yesterday and the other one of grade 9. So it helped them in the identification. I don’t know, I am just devastated. I never thought this would happen.”
