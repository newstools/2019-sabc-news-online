Former President Jacob Zuma’s lawyer Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane has requested that the Pietermaritzburg High Court allow Zuma and his co-accused Thales to appeal a recent court judgment with the Supreme Court of Appeal. This after the Pietermaritzburg High Court decided that both must face trial on charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering related to the multi-billion rand arms deal. Advocate Sikhakhane argued that they were not attacking the court in their papers submitted. “I am not even saying you are very wrong. I am saying intellectually, if you look at the prudence that seems to have guided some of the points you made, another court may well reason differently, and you are right that in all of these circumstances… the nature of the offence that you are dealing with, its harm to society is always important. But the point I am making, where the higher courts may differ with you, this court, is that it may well give more weight to the violation of the supreme law of the land.”
