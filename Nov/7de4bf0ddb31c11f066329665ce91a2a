The Supersonic car, Bloodhound, has reached the 1000km/h mark. The car has been in South Africa for the past month to conduct tests ahead of the record attempt of 1600 km/h in 2020. “So, this is proof that we’ve got a car that not only goes quick, but astoundingly quick. It’s reliable; it’s stunning and the track couldn’t have been better prepared by the guys of Northern Cape. There’s been some ups and downs over the last couple of weeks but the last few runs have been flawless and here we are. Now ready to attempt the land speed record,” says Bloodhound landspeed record car Chief Engineer, Mark Chapman. For more watch the video below:
