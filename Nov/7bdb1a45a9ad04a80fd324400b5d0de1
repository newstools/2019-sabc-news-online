Motorists have been advised to avoid Elias Motsoaledi road in Dobsonville, Soweto, following a protest by residents. It’s alleged that residents are complaining about not having electricity in their area. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar says there is also another protest in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. “There are protests this morning affecting two busy roads. Elias Motsoaledi road and Bramfisher road near Dobsonville mall. Residents of Dobsonville are complaining of not having electricity. Motorists can use Meadowlands road as alternative route. And there are also protests on Albertina Sisulu road at Princess informal settlement Roodepoort. Motorists can use Ontdekkers road as alternative route as more officers are being sent to both locations.” Commuters have been left stranded in Dobsonville Soweto as Putco buses could not drive out of the depot. Police say the protest has caused traffic congestion. The Dobsonville Mall has also been closed due to the unrest. Gauteng Police Traffic Department spokesperson, Obed Sibasa says motorists should use alternative routes. “New Canada road, as you cross over in High Gate, it’s a no go area. Traffic severely back up is at stand still motorists occupying both opposite direction facing on coming traffic. We advised motorists to avoid new Canada road and main reef road at all cost and use alternative routes that is Soweto High way and Ontdekkers.”
