The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs in KwaZulu-Natal has urged people to remain cautious this week – as wet weather conditions continue across the province. At least two people were killed in Amaoti, north of Durban, when their home collapsed on them on Monday night amid rainy conditions.   Two people also lost their lives in New Hanover, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, when a tornado ripped through the area on Tuesday – destroying several homes. The tornado developed late in the afternoon and quickly dissipated – with videos of the unusual occurrence doing rounds on social media.   KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka says, “We have received the reports and messages from the SA Weather Service that until Friday, they must be cautious because there will be severe thunderstorms.” “We want to inform our people in KwaZulu-Natal because it is across the province that they must ensure they protect themselves. But our disaster management teams are on standby.” Meanwhile, the South African Weather Services says a social media message claiming a tornado is forming in Harding, on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast and moving towards Durban is a hoax. Weather forecaster, Wisani Maluleke says there is currently no thunderstorm activity in Harding. However, thunderstorms are expected over areas in the province towards the afternoon. “Over Harding, currently there are only low level clouds and even (in) Durban (there) is only low level clouds. There is no sight of thunderstorm activity at the moment. So I can confirm that the message which is going around, it’s a hoax. However, we only expect thunderstorm activities to develop in the afternoon.”
