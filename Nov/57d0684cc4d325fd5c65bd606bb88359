Potential investors are expected to engage with government and business representatives on new investment opportunities. Last year the conference attracted R 300 billion in local and international investment commitments. This year government plans to mobilise R 1.2 trillion in new investments over the next five years. It hopes to promote the country as a preferred investment destination The investment conference takes place under the theme, accelerating economic growth by building partnership. It takes place against the backdrop of a number of economic challenges facing the country including low economic growth and the highest recorded levels in unemployment in 11 years. The country’s investment rating also hangs in the balance as it faces a possible downgrade by Moody’s rating agency over growing government debt which currently exceeds R 3 trillion.
