Members of the family of the slain Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa (27) believe that AfriForum will be able to crack the murder case of their loved one. They say they decided to approach Afriforum for help since the police have been dragging their investigations. Meyiwa was shot and killed in an alleged botched robbery five years ago at a house in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg. The goalie was gunned down in the presence of his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo, and her family members. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has yet to make any prosecutions in the matter and Meyiwa’s brother Sifiso says the police know the suspect, but a third force is trying to block the prosecution of the person. Sifiso said, “We are the ones as a family who approached them. I went on behalf of the family to ask for help since the NPA failed to deliver. Afriforum is going to work with police investigators who were appointed by Minister Bheki Cele and continue where they ended…” “The suspect is known by the police, they know who did this. They finalised everything but the NPA doesn’t want to prosecute, we think someone is involved behind this,” added Sifiso. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/767021">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
