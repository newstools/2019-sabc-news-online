A waste management centre has been established to benefit the unemployed, abused women and youth of Manyeveni, near White River in Mpumalanga. The centre is set to create over 250 job opportunities for rural women and the youth. Deputy Minister for Social Services, Henrietta Bogopane-Zulu, says the pilot project is aimed at changing the conditions of the rural women of the village by collecting waste for income. She says if the project succeeds it will be implemented in other communities in the country. “We have trained 60 young people from the same community as environmentalists who will be attached to making sure that they do outreach, teach communities how to manage their own waste to be able to benefit from selling the waste so that no one goes hungry,” says Bogopane-Zulu.
