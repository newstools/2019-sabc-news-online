Rhodes University Vice Chancellor, Dr Sizwe Mabizela, has strongly condemned violence against women. He was speaking during the official launch of the slain University of Cape Town student, Uyinene Mrwetyana’s foundation. Uyinene was raped and killed at a post office in Cape Town while collecting a parcel in August this year.   Dr Mabizela says the university has also committed a R40 thousand scholarship to any master’s student who will enroll in Genger-Based Violence studies. “This sexual and gender based violence must stop. This young woman the crime of her life had her life cut short, we can’t allow that to happen. Women in this country live in constant fear – fear of being raped, assaulted and of being killed. So as an institution of higher learning we say this must come to an end.”
