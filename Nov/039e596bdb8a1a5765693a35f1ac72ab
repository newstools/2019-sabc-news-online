Businessman Adam Catzavelos has lost his second bid to have the charge of Crimen injuria brought against him dropped. The Randburg Magistrateâ€™s Court heard that the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) has decided to proceed with the case. Earlier this year Catzavelos submitted representations to the NDPP to have the charges against him dropped after the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions denied his representations to withdraw the charges. This case follows a self-recorded video of Catzavelos, in which he allegedly utters the K-word while on holiday in Greece in August last year. In the video, he is seen celebrating the lack of black people on the beach. Catzavelos will now have to battle the charge of crimen injuria in court after two unsuccessful bids to have the charge withdrawn. The matter will return to court on the 5th of December where Catzavelos is expected to plead guilty. In August, Catzavelos reached a settlement agreement with the South African Human Rights Commission in another case relating to the video. As part of the agreement, he has to pay R150 000 over a period of 30 months. He was also ordered to make a public apology for his rant. Watch video below:
