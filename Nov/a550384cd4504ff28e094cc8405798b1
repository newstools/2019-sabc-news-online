The Mossel Bay Municipality and residents have donated over 100 000 litres of water to drought-stricken farmers in the Klein Brak and Ruiterbos areas. Good rains in the Western Cape in winter have evaded farming communities outside Mossel Bay, leaving some farmers in despair. Hearing about the plight of local farmers, Mossel Bay residents banded together to try and help. They surpassed the initial call to donate 100 000 litres of water. Farmers from Little Brak River say they are very grateful for the assistance. A spokesperson for the Mossel Bay Community Policing Forum, Leon van Dyk, says the community came out in numbers to offer a helping hand. “We then tasked the communities and all neighbourhood watches in the area, all businesses and we got to roughly about 150 000 litres of water in the long run. So 115 out of potable water, water that we could tap from the fire department and the rest were all supported by the community.” Local Deputy Mayor, Dirk Kotzé, have urged residents and visitors to adhere to the town’s water restrictions. “Yes we would like them to use water sparingly. I think throughout South Africa at this stage we are in a drought stricken area. So this is a precious resource at this stage for everybody.”
