South African Airways (SAA) has cancelled all its domestic, regional and international flights scheduled for Friday and Saturday. The decision follows an announcement by the South African cabin crew Association and union NUMSA that their members will embark on industrial action Friday morning. The unions have issued SAA with a 48 hour strike notice over wage disputes and the planned restructuring of the airline that could see over 900 workers losing their jobs. Only flights operated by South African Airways will be affected. All flights operated on SA Express, Mango, SA airlink and all codeshare partners will not be affected. SAA has advised customers not to go to their departure airports during the planned disruption. SAA Spokesperson, Tlali Tlali says: “We decided to cancel flights for two days with effect from Friday. That means all our flights will be cancelled for Friday and Saturday. We have decided to make this decision so that we are able to give our customers a reasonable notice in order for them to make arrangements for travel based on other means and other flights.”     Meanwhile, the unions say they will challenge any attempt by SAA to interdict the planned strike. SACCA’s Zazi Nsibanyoni-Anyiam says: “As workers we have every right to embark on industrial action to seek fair wages. I mean I’ll be shocked if any court in this land will rule against us. We don’t believe it will be successful and we are ready for them. Its unfortunate that they are willing to spend you know millions once again to fight us.” Related Video below  SABC Reporter, Nozintombi Miya has more below
