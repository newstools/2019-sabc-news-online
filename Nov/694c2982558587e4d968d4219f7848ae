The High Court in Johannesburg has ordered the State in the case of terror-accused twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie, to hand over all outstanding documents to the defence by Friday next week. The twin brothers were arrested in July 2016 for allegedly plotting a series of attacks on Jewish targets and the US Embassy in the country. They’ve been charged with conspiracy and incitement to commit terror-related crimes. Following numerous delays in the case over the last three years, the High Court has ordered the State to ensure that all outstanding documents are handed over to the accused’s lawyers so they can prepare for trial. This after the twins’ attorney Annelene van den Heever accused the State of using delaying tactics to prolong the trial. However, the State disputed the accusation, arguing that it was due to technical difficulties that it has not managed to hand over all the outstanding documents. A trial date is expected to be set when the matter returns to court on Friday next week.
