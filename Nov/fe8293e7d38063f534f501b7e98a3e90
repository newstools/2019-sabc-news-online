Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said close to 4900 people died from gunshots, stabbings and assault in Gauteng in the 2018/19 financial year. In a written response to a question by the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Gauteng Legislature Masuku highlighted the highest cause of unnatural deaths in Gauteng. About 2416 gunshot deaths were recorded followed by motor vehicle accidents at almost 1700 and stabbings at close to 1300. The MEC said these figures were recorded by state mortuaries and reflect deaths at the incident scene, or people who survived the initial trauma, but later died due to complications at home or at health care facilities. Masuku said one of the contributing factors is the high level of alcohol consumption which leads to violence and reckless driving.
