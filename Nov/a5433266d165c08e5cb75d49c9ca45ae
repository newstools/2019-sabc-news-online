Former Eskom Chairperson and business man Reuel Khoza says Eskom could perform better if all the directors who proved their capabilities at the power utility could be asked to come back. He was speaking at the South African Jewish Board of Deputies Conference in Johannesburg on Sunday night where a number if issues were discussed “All you need to do is to approach them without political pre-conditions. A good number of them are actually working in the pacific basin… and I’m still in contact with them. A good number are in Australia and New Zealand. And they are keen to come back home provided you give them a platform. And you stay out of that as a political force. And if you put together a Board, make sure you got people who are knowledgeable, and not populate it with people who are in deployment…. deployment kills business.”
