A child minder accused of killing a toddler left in her care at the baby’s home in Daveyton on Gauteng’s Eastrand is expected to apply for bail in the Benoni Magistrate’s court on Friday morning. Mannana Celinah Tsabane is accused of the murder of 20-month-old Langelihle Mnguni whose body was found inside one of the rooms in the house in October. It is alleged that the baby was strangled. Langelihle’s parents Lerato Mnguni and Sihle Tshabalala spoke to reporters outside court on Wednesday after Tsabane’s case was postponed. They said they want justice for their little boy. Mnguni says, “Yes it’s the court proceedings unfortunately you can’t speed up the process but we are hoping justice will prevail. I never thought something like this would happen to me as Langa was my only child, my first child – I am really shocked of what has happened.”  WATCH BELOW:
