Veteran broadcaster Xolani Gwala will be laid to rest at Novuka Village at Impendle in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. Gwala passed away on Friday after a battle with colon cancer. He was 44. Gwala started his career as a newsreader at the Durban based SABC radio station, Ukhozi FM. He went on to work for other radio stations, returning to the public broadcaster and working at current affairs shows like News Hour and Asikhulume. At the time of his death he was employed by Primedia. Family spokesperson Thula Gwala says the family is still trying to come into terms with the loss. “We are so thankful to all the listeners of SABC who supported Xolani during his stint at SABC and as well as 702. We are so thankful and we are mindful of the fact that Xolani was not owned by our own family only but he was owned by the whole of South Africa.” “Therefore we like all the people of South Africa to understand that the family does not ignore the fact that they had a role to play and their role was very important and we are thankful for that.” Related video click below:
