Veteran broadcaster, Xolani Gwala, has been described as a hardworking and humble individual – who was a fierce proponent of the country’s democracy. This as Gwala’s official provincial funeral is under way in his home town of Impendle in KwaZulu-Natal.   Gwala died last week Friday after succumbing to colon cancer. He had been battling the disease for two years.   Xolani Gwala’s brother, Simo, delivered the obituary.   “Xolani Gwala was affectionately known as Bra X. He was a South African journalist, a gentlemen and a fierce proponent of our democracy. After the London Marathon, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer and put on a brave fight for two years until last Friday. Xolani’s love for life and generosity made him an exceptional human being. He was hard working and humble, a good brother to his siblings and the pride of the Gwala family.”
