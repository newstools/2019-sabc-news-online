Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the overwhelming majority of parents who sought places for their grade ones and eights were adequately serviced by the online application system. Over 30 000 learners are yet to be placed in schools by the Gauteng Department of Education for the 2020 Academic Year. Lesufi gave an update in Johannesburg on the situation on Monday. He says his department has already placed 85%  of learners that applied on time and is confident that the remaining applicants will be placed by the end of the month. The department erroneously sent parents an SMS telling them to head to their nearest district for placement. That resulted in chaotic scenes at district offices but Lesufi has since apologised. ” When we opened the registration and closed it, we received 310 000 applications which simply means that 310 000 people lodged applications on behalf of their learners. Others are twins, others are siblings, others are brothers and sisters. Out of the 310 000, we asked those that applied to give us documents. Of the 310 000 that applied, we could establish the 27 000 did not give us documents. If you minus that, you are left with 282 000 legitimate applications. It’s only 34 553 learners that don’t have spaces at all in Gauteng.” For more  watch video below:
