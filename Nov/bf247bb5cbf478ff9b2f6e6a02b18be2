Westville Community Policing Forum has installed licence plate recognition cameras that are able to detect suspicious vehicles to alert police and patrollers in the Durban suburb. Automatic number-plate recognition ( ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. These cameras are able to read the licence plates of each vehicle in the suburb and detail it. The funds for the installation of cameras were raised through various CPF initiatives. EThekwini Cluster Community Policing Forum chairperson, Imtiaz Syed, says they want to create a database of suspicious vehicles and be able to analyse the data of those vehicles. “We are also trying to lobby few retailers association to start installing these ANPR and LPR cameras at shopping centres and service stations and shopping malls. Because every vehicle needs to use fuel . We will automatically start getting information or feedback from the system to say this is the location of the vehicle filling fuel giving us the history of where this vehicle is running and where it’s going to. In that way, it can alert SAPS as to exactly what is the pattern and the route of criminal activity around our area.”
