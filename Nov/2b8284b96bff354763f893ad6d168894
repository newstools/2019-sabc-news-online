The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Free State has discouraged consumers from going out and spending their hard earned money on Black Friday. The party has called upon the National Credit Regulator to audit advertised discounts by retailers. It says consumers are lured into spending money when deals are not really discounted as claimed. Free State SACP Second Deputy Secretary, Mojalefa Simango says Black Friday is used by big business to steal from the working class. “The likes are in renting our people further and most importantly they are making our people to use little money they earned in this difficult economic situation.” Related video click below:
