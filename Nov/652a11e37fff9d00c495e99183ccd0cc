Former Director-General in the Presidency Reverend Frank Chikane has described in detail how former GCIS Head Themba Maseko approached him for advice when he had been asked by former President Jacob Zuma to go and meet the Guptas in 2011. Chikane told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that Maseko was worried about the implications of meeting the Guptas – due to the noise about them being allegedly corrupt. He says he advised Maseko to go meet with the Guptas and take it from there – as he would possibly be charged by the former President if he didn’t obey his instruction. “He then called me and said I have been given an ultimatum that if I don’t deliver – I will not be DG by Wednesday this coming week it should have been about Friday – we didn’t have much of a discussion it was just for him to tell me things,” says Chikane.
