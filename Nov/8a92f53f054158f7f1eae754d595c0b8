The Transport Ministry has released a statement denying that the speed limits on roads will be decreased immediately and that a zero percent alcohol policy for drivers will be implemented. Spokesperson, Ayanda Allie Paine has clarified a misunderstanding in the media that the Department of Transport is about to implement speed reductions and lower the permissible blood alcohol level for motorists in the immediate future. Transport Ministry She says the department receives many suggestions on how to reduce road carnage and consider all of them. She says some are put to the test to measure their viability and are then either adopted (via due process) or abandoned. Others are ruled out outright when judged against the country’s legal framework and other criteria. “Recently the Ministry of Transport was asked a set of questions by a particular media house about whether or not we are considering a number of proposals that are aimed at reducing the carnage on our roads. In our response to our questions, it has now surfaced that there has been a misunderstanding. It appears some members of the public are of the view that the department is just about to implement speed reductions and lower the permissible blood alcohol limit for motorists in the immediate future. We wish to clarify that this is not the case.”
