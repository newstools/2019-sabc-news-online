President Cyril Ramaphosa says that all forms of gander-based violence must be condemned. He is expected to launch the campaign 16 Days of No Violence Against Women and Children at the Witpoort police station outside Lephalale in Limpopo on Monday. Delivering the O.R. Tambo memorial lecture outside Lephalale on Sunday, in his capacity as African National Congress, President Ramaphosa said that more attention should be paid to the empowerment of women. “We must banish gender discrimination in every area of society from the home to the factory and it’s our revolutionary task comrades to take up the fight against all forms of violence including the violence that is perpetrated by men against the women and the children of our country.”
