The African National Congress (ANC) has expressed concern over violence that flared-up at a rally in Hammanskraal outside Pretoria on Saturday. Twenty-five year old Lethabo Nkoana was shot dead during a league meeting at Temba Stadium in Tshwane. Another league member, who was also shot, was hospitalised. A probe is underway. Two weeks ago, during another youth league meeting in Limpopo, National Executive Committee members Fikile Mbalula and Malusi Gigaba, were forced to flee after violent clashes broke out, resulting in two vehicles belonging to league members being set alight. The ANC says it’s waiting for a report from the National Youth Task Team before deciding what action to take on what happened at the weekend. The task team has since postponed all its assemblies until further notice. “We cannot tolerate hooliganism, we are not going to allow gangsters who are trigger happy to come and occupy our meetings and scare the lives of young people who are supposed to participate in the sustaining of our own national democratic revolution; it’s not going to happen,” says ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe .
