Political Analyst, Ongama Mtimka, has outlined what he believes will be the outcome of a meeting, in which City of Johannesburg councillors will vote for a new mayor. A new mayor will be elected on Thursday – following Herman Mashaba’s resignation from the post. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has nominated its regional leader, Musa Novela, as its mayoral candidate.   The Democratic Alliance (DA), which currently leads the coalition government in the city, has selected finance Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC), Funzi Ngobeni. The African National Congress (ANC) is yet to name its candidate. Mtimka says it’s likely that a coalition government will have to be negotiated. “I think the EFF are playing a political game of reinforcing their importance here. What is likely to happen is after the meeting and there is a failure to put in a mayor, the political parties will meet and try and form a coalition government. Otherwise it is flexing its muscles and augmenting strength enough to force a negotiation,” explains Mtimka. Click below for related videos….
