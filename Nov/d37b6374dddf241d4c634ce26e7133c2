The City of Tshwane has emphasised that water in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, is still not suitable for human consumption. Residents of the City of Tshwane are experiencing challenges regarding water supply as reservoir levels continue to plummet. Speaking to the SABC  on Thursday morning Utility member of the mayoral committee (MMC) Abel Tau outlined the water situation in Hammanskraal. “Water has to meet a number of parameters. One of those which it doesn’t meet is that there are a lot of nitrates which are harmful to people. For that reason we said as the City of Tshwane together with our partners in the Department of Water and Sanitation that we will not encourage people to drink the water here.” Tau says responding to this emergency situation came at a cost to the municipality for 160 water tank trucks that have been supplying Hammanskraal with water for a month now. “The rates that were involved then coupled with the number of tanks and the hours that they were procuring for, on average we were pushing them to work for up to 18 hours a day. That has escalated the figure to around R6 million a week.” Related video below
