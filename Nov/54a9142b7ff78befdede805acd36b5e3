Lobby group Afriforum will on Tuesday make an announcement on its offer to investigate the murder of Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Miyewa. Meyiwa was killed in Vosloorus in 2014 at the home of his girlfriend, singer Kelly Khumalo. Those present in the house at the time told police Meyiwa was shot in a robbery gone wrong. Meyiwa was shot and killed on October 26 in 2014 in a home where there were more than five people. Last month, Senzo Meyiwa’s family approached Afriforum as they felt that the police have not been able to crack the murder case. Police questioned 13 people after the murder, but they were all released. Police then arrested a 25 year old man but the case was thrown out of court due to lack of evidence. The National Prosecuting Authority has now released a statement indicating that they will question all witnesses who were in the house when the murder was committed. Over the years, it was reported that several arrests were imminent in the case, but that has not come to pass. After Meyiwa’s father died earlier this year, police minister Bheki Cele said he had not given up on bringing Meyiwa’s killers to book and was planning to map out a way to find justice.
