ACDP Chief Whip Steve Swart has called for Parliament’s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee chairperson Bongani Bongo to step down,  pending the outcome of his corruption case. The Hawks arrested Bongo on allegations that he tried to bribe then evidence leader Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara to frustrate the Parliamentary inquiry into Eskom. Swart says while Bongo should be considered innocent until proved guilty, it would be in the best interest of Parliament for him to step down. “It would seem wise that he should stand down from that position, given the allegations that are against him. We saw that in the past with of the Bosasa allegations against Mr. Vincent Smith. He then stood down from the committee that was dealing with the Section 25 of the land issue. So we think there is a precedent to stand down, pending the outcome of both is criminal actions and of course possible continuation of misconduct hearings in the ethics committee.” Meanwhile, Parliament says National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise will meet MP, Bongo, regarding his arrest. Bongo, who chairs Parliament’s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee, was released on bail of five-thousand-rand by the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Thursday morning. He is accused of trying to bribe Ntuthuzelo Vanara, the then evidence leader in a Parliamentary inquiry into Eskom to disrupt the work of the commission. Modise’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the Speaker will be kept informed regarding the case. “There will be an interaction between the speaker and the member… The institution can continue to monitor it.”
