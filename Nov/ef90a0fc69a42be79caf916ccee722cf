Former head of South Africa’s Secret Service Mo Shaik will continue to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown this morning. Yesterday, Shaik told the commission that the then State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele, stopped the intelligence from investigating the Guptas in 2011. He said the agency wanted to investigate what it called ‘created dependency” after the Gupta brothers notified Fikile Mbalula of his appointment to the Sports Department before President Jacob Zuma made the announcement. Cwele fired Shaik, together with Gibson Njenje, who’s also expected to testify today and Jeff Maqethuka, saying they had been involved in an irregular investigation which amounted to fighting personal battles. Shaik said Cwele was clear that he did not want the investigation to proceed. Click video below for more:
