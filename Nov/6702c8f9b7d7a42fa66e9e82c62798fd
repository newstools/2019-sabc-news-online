The Rand is slightly firmer as investors weighed the impact of U.S. backing for protesters in Hong Kong on its trade negotiations with China. The local currency is in tune with swings in sentiment driven by the trade dispute between the worldâ€™s two largest economies, mainly ignoring home-grown signs of an increasingly weak economy and fiscal position. The Rand is currently trading at R14.69 against the dollar.
