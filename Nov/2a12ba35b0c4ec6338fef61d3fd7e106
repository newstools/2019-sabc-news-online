The African National Congress (ANC) has expressed concern at the situation unfolding at South African Airways (SAA). The party has urged management and workers to find a sustainable solution to their dispute. The national airline is contemplating retrenching over 900 workers. Staffers are threatening to strike on Friday over pay and the possible retrenchment of workers. SAA’s management has cancelled flights for the next two days in anticipation of workers’ downing tools. “We call on all those involved to be able sit around and attend to the concerns that workers have raised and make sure that a solution is found and one that the critical services that SAA is expected to provide or is providing on a daily basis could be able to continue unhindered,” says ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says they are in solidarity with SAA workers who are facing job losses. “We call on all our fighters particularly around Ekurhuleni and where there are airports across the country to join in solidarity and support the workers to defend jobs. We can’t afford for any single one more South African to lose their job because already half of our adult population is unemployed,” says EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.
