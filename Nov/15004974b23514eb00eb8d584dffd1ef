The African National Congress (ANC) says it’s waiting for a report from the National Youth Task Team before deciding what action to take. This is after violent clashes broke out at a gathering in Pretoria, resulting in the death of one member and the wounding of another. Two weeks ago, during another youth league meeting in Limpopo, National Executive Committee members Fikile Mbalula and Malusi Gigaba, were forced to flee after violent clashes broke out, resulting in two vehicles belonging to league members being set alight. The task team has since postponed all its assemblies until further notice. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says what happened at the weekend was mere hooliganism. “We cannot tolerate hooliganism, we are not going to allow gangsters who are trigger happy to come and occupy our meetings and scare the lives of young people who are supposed to participate in the sustenance of our own national democratic revolution – it’s not going to happen.”  Watch video below:
