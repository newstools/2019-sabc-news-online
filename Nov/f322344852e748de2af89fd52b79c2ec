US Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo continued his two-day tour of Germany on Thursday with a visit to the border museum in the tiny village of Moedlareuth, which was divided for more than 38 years by the Iron Curtain and belonged to two different countries and ideological systems. Half of the village was in the old German kingdom of Bavaria, the other part in the eastern state of Thuringia. Moedlareuthâ€™s museum is an open air museum in the village and includes an authentic part of the Wall from the German-German border. The 2.5 meter (eight foot) high segment, similar to the famous Berlin Wall, remains a fixture in the village centre even 30 years after Communism collapsed. Nowadays the farming hamlet that lies some 300 km (186 miles) south of Berlin has become a prime destination for tourists searching for the remnants of the Communist era when East and West Germany were divided. The inhabitants of sleepy Moedlareuth have grown used to the constant influx of visitors who shuffle to the museum to watch a 20-minute film documenting the peculiar split reality that became normality for nearly four decades. More than 90,000 visitors came to Moedlareuth in 2015.
