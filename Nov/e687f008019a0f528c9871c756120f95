As the ongoing water crisis in Hammanskraal north of Pretoria continues, the Gauteng provincial government and the Democratic Alliance (DA) led City of Tshwane are working together to find a solution. Residents say the water tankers commissioned to supply water in the area cannot meet their demands. Some say the trucks do not reach them while others say the restored water coming out of the taps is dirty and not safe for drinking. Residents say they are continuing to struggle to access clean water in Kanana and other parts of Hammanskraal. ” After I put Jik into the water I wait 30 minutes to an hour before I can drink it,” says one frustrated resident. The City of Tshwane says more than 150 water trucks have been assigned to deliver water to affected areas daily since last month. The City is currently spending about R2 million per week for tankers to supply water to affected areas. City of Tshwane MMC for Utility Services, Abel Tau, says they’re on top of the situation, though there are challenges. “Water has to meet a number of parameters. One of those which it doesn’t meet is that there is a lot of nitrates and nitrites which are harmful to obviously people with weakened immune systems or prolonged exposure. For that reason, we said as the City of Tshwane together obviously with our partners in the Department of Water and Sanitation that we will not encourage people to drink water here.” For more watch video below:
