The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) says students wishing to apply should do so at the offices of the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) before until 12:00 on Saturday. Students can still apply online until midnight on Saturday. A tweet from @NYDARSA says “NYDA Offices are open from 08:00 – 12:00 today as part of the last push before closing of applications at midnight.” NSFAS recently partnered with the NYDA to use their centres to assist applicants who have not yet applied for funding, especially those who do not have internet access and those in rural areas. Department of Higher Education spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi says, “It is only a day left before the closing of 2020 applications and anyone who has not as yet applied to further their studies for the 2020 academic year at any public university or TVET college in South Africa should take advantage of this arrangement and apply.” Applications close at midnight tonight.
