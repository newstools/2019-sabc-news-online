The Durban High Court will on Tuesday hear evidence of the State’s key witness in the matter of a 44 -year-old man accused of kidnapping and killing nine-year-old Miguel Louw in Durban last year. The defence earlier accused police of not following proper procedure during the arrest of Mohammed Ebrahim who is facing charges of theft, kidnapping and murder. The incident allegedly took place at Phoenix, north of Durban last year. The State is to bring in its key witness, Rajen Govender, who is the investigating officer in this matter. Govender is expected to give evidence linking Ebrahim to the case. On Monday,  Ebrahim’s legal team said police do not have proof that the rights of their client were read out to him on the day of his arrest. They also said there are no records of Ebrahim agreeing to be interviewed or recording his statement without the presence of his attorney.
