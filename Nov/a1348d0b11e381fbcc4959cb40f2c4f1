The KwaZulu-Natal government has criticised the private health sector for the high cost of medical care. Addressing members of parliament at the provincial legislature, acting Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the National Health Insurance (NHI) system would allow both the insured and the uninsured to enjoy the benefits of receiving quality health care without worrying about funds being exhausted. She says fast tracking NHI could be the main solution in addressing HIV/AIDS, Cancer and TB. “The private health care in South Africa is highly concentrated; it’s exorbitant, uncompetitive and lacks innovation. That is what the competition Commission found. They also found that general practitioners are distributed relatively unevenly across the uninsured population,” explains Dube-Ncube.
