The Khoisan Revolution Party in the Northern Cape has applauded President Cyril Ramaphosa for signing the Khoi San leadership act into law, saying this has brought dignity to the Khoisan community. According to the Presidency, the act aims to aims to protect, promote, legitimise and restore the integrity of traditional and Khoi-San leadership. The act also calls for Khoisan Communities to align customary law and customs with the Bill of Rights. Khoisan Revolution Party Leader Stanley Peterson says they view the signing of the Bill as recognition. “It is for the first time in the history of South Africa that any government recognises the Khoi and San communities and their leaders. Now we feel that the injustices are being restored, and we feel like SA citizens. To be in your own country and not be recognised was really sore for us,” says Peterson. Meanwhile, the leader of the !Xun community from Platfontein near Kimberley says they have mixed reactions regarding the signing of the Khoi San leadership act into law – fearing that they will not be represented. !Xun leader Antonio Sabao says the tribes are related with the Khoisan but they are not one people. He says he has issues with being represented by the Khoisan, calling for equal representation of the various tribes in the house of traditional leaders. “The thing that worries us is that the Khoi and San will not look after the !Xun. They will only take care of their own people. That’s why we want our own leader in Parliament to solve our issues. We also fear that our culture will die if we don’t have our own leader.”
