President Cyril Ramaphosa has reiterated that South Africa will only embark on a nuclear power project when the country can afford it. Last month, the Energy Ministry announced that government’s plans for additional power generation will include a variety of energy sources over the next decade. Speaking to CNBC Africa, Ramaphosa says there are plans to extend the lifeline of the Eskom-owned Koeberg – South Africa’s sole nuclear power plant. He says: “It is there as an option for us to go for but right now it is an expensive option.” “We will opt for nuclear at a pace, time and cost that we can afford. It is a good, safe and renewable type of energy source. It is an option that is open for us.” “We haven’t closed the door on nuclear and we are going to be revitalising Koeberg so that it gives us a few more years to go forward,” says Ramaphosa.
