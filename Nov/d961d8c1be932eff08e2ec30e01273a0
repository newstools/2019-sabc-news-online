The South African Energy Forum has called on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to make public all documents and video interviews related to the interview and assessment process regarding the appointment of the new Eskom CEO. The Forum which is comprised of experts from Energy, Civil Society and the Business Community described the process, which ended in the appointment of Andre De Ruyter, as flawed and questionable. In an open letter, the South African Energy Forum (SAEF) questions how a candidate with no energy or utility experience could be appointed. It also expressed concern about De Ruyterâ€™s relationship with Finance Minister Tito Mboweni who is a former Nampak chairperson. De Ruyter will be leaving his post as Nampak CEO to take over at Eskom on January 15, 2019. Click related video below:
