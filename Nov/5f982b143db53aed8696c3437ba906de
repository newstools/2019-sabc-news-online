President Cyril Ramaphosa is to officially open the newly built Mpumalanga High Court in Mbombela on Friday. Among those who are expected to attend the opening ceremony is Justice Minister, Ronald Lamola, Minister for Public Works, Patricia De Lille and Judge President of the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court, Francis Legodi. Legodi presided over the first sitting of the High Court in May. He says the official opening of the high court is not only important to the judiciary but also to the residents of Mpumalanga. “The judges will just be here to carry out their traditional functions, but what is very important is how the court will assist people around here – because in the past as you might know the people from around this area had to travel to Pretoria or Johannesburg to access our courts.”  WATCH BELOW:
