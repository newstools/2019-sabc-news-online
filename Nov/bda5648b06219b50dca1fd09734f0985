Alister Chabi who is an Actuarial Scientist testifying at the State Capture Commission says the R15.9 billion increase of Transnetâ€™s 1 064 locomotives contract was unjustifiable. Chabi was commissioned by MNS Attorneys to test reasonability of the increase of the 1 064 locomotives contract from R38 billion to R54 billion.   He says the 41% increase in the estimated total value of the contract was unreasonable.   The then board of Transnet was requested to approve the increase of 10 64 contract by former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe.
