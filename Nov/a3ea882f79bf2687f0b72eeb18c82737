Democratic Alliance (DA) MP, Alf Lees has called for South African Airways(SAA) to be sold-off.  This after most political parties in Parliament came out in support of an equity partner for the ailing national carrier. During a parliamentary debate on the impact of the recent strike at the airline, parties say it’s unsustainable for the taxpayer to continue pumping money into the entity. Some have supported a call for an equity partner to be found while others have called for its outright privatisation. Lees says South Africans have had enough of SAA needing to be bailed out. He says: “It is only the ANC and the trade unions who stubbornly persist with maintaining SAA as a state owned charity. SAA must be put into business rescue. The government guarantee debt will have to be accommodated and SAA must be sold for whatever the best offer received from Branson, Emirates Ethiopian or any other.”
