The South African Social and Economic Development Forum has called on government to intervene to stop the closure of ArcelorMittal in Saldanha Bay on the West Coast. More than 900 people stand to lose their jobs. A group of community members is currently staging a picket at the gates of the plant. Spokesperson, Sammy Claassen, says theyâ€™re planning to write to the Trade and Industry Ministry, requesting a meeting with stakeholders, to discuss a solution. He says he believes the plant can still be saved. The company said earlier that its no longer economically viable to keep operations going.   Police are monitoring the picket.
