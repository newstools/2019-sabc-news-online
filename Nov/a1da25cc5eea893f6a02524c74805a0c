Three of the four accused in six year old Amy Leigh de Jager kidnapping and extortion case will spend the festive season behind bars. Tharina Human, Pieter van Zyl, Laetitia Nel and Molemohi Bafokeng appeared briefly in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrates Court in the Vaal before the case was postponed to January next year. They face charges of kidnapping and extortion after R2 million was initially demanded from the little girl’s family. Nel’s R25 000 bail has been extended. The state says it is still awaiting DNA results which could help it link the accused to the crime. Amy Leigh was kidnapped in September outside the Kollegepark Primary School as her mother was dropping her off. She was released unharmed by her kidnappers. All the four accused are expected back in court on January 6. The state says they will push for the case to be transferred to the High Court in February next year.
