President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa has lost a visionary leader who advanced social cohesion. The President was speaking at the funeral service of King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu at the Ngqadu Royal Palace in the Eastern Cape. Ramaphosa says the King’s influence had extended beyond the borders of South Africa. “As a nation, we have lost a respected leader who was a pillar of the community and a solid partner of our government. We can say that a great tree has fallen in this place. On behalf of the people of South Africa, I extend my deepest condolences to the royal family and the AmaXhosa people. We are saddened but we know that no matter how much we wish… we cannot hold back the hand of fate, it was his majesty time to leave us,” says the President.    King Zwelonke Sigcawu was given an Official Funeral, Category One which includes full military service. His funeral service was attended by former President Thabo Mbeki, representatives of different political parties including the African National Congress (ANC), the United Democratic Movement (UDM), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), members of different royal houses and thousands of community members. He has hailed the AmaXhosa King for promoting harmony and being an advocate for traditional leadership and unity in the Eastern Cape. Mbeki has also thanked the President for honouring the King with an Official Funeral.
