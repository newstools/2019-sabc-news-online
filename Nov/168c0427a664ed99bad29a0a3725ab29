The City of Tshwane’s water woes continue. Thousands of residents in various parts in and around the city are still frustrated with on-going water shortages. The water crisis is as a result of some reservoirs running low. One of the latest and hardest hit areas is Laudium, west of Pretoria where water levels are reported to be below 4% level. One resident says: “The problem started two weeks ago. As we are Muslim when we have to pray we need water. We have to bath like five times a day, when we have to go for prayer.” “Even when we use the toilet we don’t use the toilet paper, we use water. This water crisis has affected my business. It’s far to go get water. Sometimes I don’t cook. I don’t sell because of the problem of water.” Related video click below:
