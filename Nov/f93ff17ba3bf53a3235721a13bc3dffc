Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu says irregular expenditure in government departments and state-owned enterprises has increased from R51-billion last year to R62,60 billion this year. He was briefing the media in Parliament after releasing audit outcomes for government departments and state-owned enterprises for 2018/2019. Makwetu has described as disappointing the audit outcomes of about 432 national and provincial government departments as well as state-owned enterprises. He says this figure might be higher as they could not audit contracts worth R2.3 billion due to missing or incomplete information. “These are disappointing audit results for 2018/19 as they show slow progress over the past five financial years meaning that the improvements that were promised and committed over a number of years have not come forth. Part of the reason for this slow progress is largely to do with the fact that those that are charged with governance were very slow in implementing the commitment made in previous years, in some instances they totally disregarded it.”
