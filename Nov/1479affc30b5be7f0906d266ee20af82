The Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have conducted a search and seizure operation at the province’s Social Development head offices in Pietermaritzburg. No one has been arrested at this stage. KZN Hawks spokesperson Simphiwe Mhlongo says they are collecting evidence and files as part of their investigations into alleged fraud and corruption. “We can confirm that the Hawks members in KwaZulu-Natal conducted a search and seizure operation at the office of Social Development in Pietermaritzburg. This search emanates from the allegation of fraud, corruption, money laundering and contravention of Public Finance Management Act that was reported to the Hawks this year. There are no arrests that have been made at this stage. It is just a search and seizure operation where Hawks are looking for evidence and files that connect the crime and allegations that are levelled against alleged perpetrators.”
