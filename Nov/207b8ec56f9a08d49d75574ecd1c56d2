The African Farmers Association of South Africa (Afasa) is calling on government to declare drought as a national disaster. The association says already the country’s five provinces are hard hit by drought. The provinces include North West, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Cape, and the Eastern Cape. Afasa Chairperson Neo Masithela says: “Farmers are losing their livestock, farmers are losing crops and farmers are not doing very well. In light of that, we understand that it is a matter of national importance and that national government must consider declaring most of the areas a national disaster to enable government to have a direct impact and support farmers.” Masithela says they have already contacted the Department of Agriculture to assist farmers who are affected by drought.
