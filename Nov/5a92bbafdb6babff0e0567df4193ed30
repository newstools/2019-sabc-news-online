Outgoing Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba says over R30 billion worth of investment has been secured towards the revamp of the inner city. This will go towards the rehabilitation of about 184 buildings in the city, some of which had been hijacked. He says he’s been able to turn the inner city into an investment hub. He says: “R32 billion of investments are already signed with bank guarantees. It has never happened, not only in the city of Johannesburg, it has never happened in the history of South Africa to have R32 billion worth of investment at  one time. As MMC Masango indicated when we took over this government, the first 22 years of democracy, the highest investment attraction was at R4.5 billion.” Mashaba has been addressing investors who are part of the Inner City Partnership Forum in Braamfontein.
