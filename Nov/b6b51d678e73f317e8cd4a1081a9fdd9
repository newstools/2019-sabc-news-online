The High Court in Pretoria has postponed to next Wednesday the hearing in an application to get the police and the City of Tshwane to deal with the hundreds of foreign nationals camping outside the United Nations building in Pretoria. The postponement is to allow National Police Commissioner, Khehla Sitole, and the Gauteng Provincial Commissioner, Elias Mawela, to file answering affidavits by Monday. The Brooklyn and Eastern Areas Citizens Association and the Waterkloof Homeowners Association want an urgent interim interdict against the refugees, mainly to prevent them from staying and sleeping there at night.
