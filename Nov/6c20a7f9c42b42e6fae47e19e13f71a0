The Democratic Alliance (DA) has placed Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa on special leave. In a statement, the party says, “The DA leadership has met with Mayor Mokgalapa yesterday and today to discuss the serious allegations made against him and Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Transport Councillor Sheila Senkubuge, claimed to be supported by an audio clip that is being widely distributed. The DA has instituted a Federal Legal Commission investigation where Mayor Mokgalapa and MMC Sheila Senkubuge will be given the opportunity to present their version of events. Mayor Mokgapala will be placed on Special leave while these investigations are underway.” Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) Tshwane Caucus has submitted an urgent motion of no confidence against Mokgalapa. The EFF says the City of Tshwane has been limping from one disaster to another since Mokgalapa took office. The party says the DA administration has proven to be incapable of resolving the City’s service delivery issues. The EFF has cited the escalating water crisis in Hammanskraal, the deterioration of fiscal and procurement management standards, and constant power outages in various areas as reasons for its decision. The motion of no confidence will be tabled at a council meeting on Thursday. The DA says it has noted the EFF’s move,” The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has tabled a motion of no confidence in DA-led Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. The DA has made great progress since taking over the City of Tshwane administration in 2016 and we will continue to put the residents first in delivering quality services”.
