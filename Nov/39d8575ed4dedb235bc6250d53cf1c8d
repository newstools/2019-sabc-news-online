Former president Jacob Zuma has lost his appeal in the Derek Hanekom defamation suit. Judge Dhaya Pillay made the ruling in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday. In September, Pillay had ordered Zuma to remove a tweet from his social media account in which he called the former Tourism Minister a known enemy agent and also ordered him to issue a public apology to Hanekom. Earlier this week Zuma’s legal team argued that the tweet was fair comment in the context of a political debate. Hanekom’s legal team insisted that Zuma should prove his allegation that the former minister was an enemy agent.  WATCH
