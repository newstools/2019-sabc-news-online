Former President Jacob Zuma and French Arms manufacturer Thales are expected to hear on Friday if they’ve succeeded in their application for leave to appeal the judgment which rejected their application for a permanent stay of prosecution. The full bench of the Pietermaritzburg High Court heard their arguments for leave to appeal to a higher court last week. Thales is also petitioning the Constitutional Court directly. Among Zuma’s arguments was that the court overlooked unfair delays, which he pinned on the National Prosecution Authority. He also alleged that the institution was abused by certain politicians to fight political battles. He argued that another court could give more consideration to the violation of his constitutional rights. Thales argued that a higher court would find differently on the validity of the re-instatement of the charges against it. The state opposed both applications and described their cases as hopeless. The state argued that there was no prospect that an appeal court would uphold Zuma’s baseless and insulting allegations that the High Court sanitised the National prosecuting authority’s constitutional violations. The state also says the reasons for the decision to re-instate the charges against Thales was rational. Related video click below:
