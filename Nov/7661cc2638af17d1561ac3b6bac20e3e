Eskom has warned of a high risk of load shedding. Eskom is expected to implement Stage 2 rotational load shedding from 10pm on Thursday evening until 5am on Friday. The power utility has warned that the power system continued to remain severely constrained and vulnerable and that the public should expect unplanned breakdowns. “Today, unfortunately, we lost three additional generating units and had to use our emergency reserves in order to meet the demand throughout the day and as a result of that, we now have our emergency reserve at critically low levels and need to replenish them overnight in order to meet tomorrow’s forecast demand in electricity. The risk of load shedding is there tomorrow as well,” says Deputy Spokesperson for Eskom, Dikatso Mothae.
