A delegation from Kenya has arrived in Polokwane in Limpopo for a two-day bilateral mission focusing on social welfare. MEC of Social Development, Nkakareng Rakgoale, and the head of the Kenyan delegation, Ebrahim Salim are scheduled to conduct site visits to various welfare centres including  South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) offices. Rakgoale says the two countries are hoping to improve conditions affecting children and alleviate poverty. “They are in this country compiling policies to be able to guide them in terms of dealing with issues of children, dealing with issues of poverty, making sure that we deal with the triple challenges. I think as South Africans we are ahead in terms of policy development. All that we need to do is to make sure that our policies do not gather dust, we must make sure that they are implemented and actually enforced.”
