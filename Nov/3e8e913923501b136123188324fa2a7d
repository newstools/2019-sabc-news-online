The Eastern Cape cabinet has taken steps that will result in placing the Nelson Mandela Bay metro under administration. The provincial cabinet has taken a decision to second officials to act as municipal manager and chief financial officer. This is pending the settlement of a dispute on the acting municipal manager and the appointment of the CFO. Co-operative Governance MEC Xolile Nqatha has issued a letter to the metro in line with Section 139 of the Constitution. The cabinet also supports the establishment of a provincial multi-disciplinary task team to assist the acting municipal manager. The metro council has not sat for a number of times due to political infighting.
