Former President Jacob Zuma has weighed in on the matter between the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Public Protector regarding his tax information. Speaking through his Twitter account, Zuma says that he’s not opposed to Public Protector  Busisiwe Mkhwebane‘s request for his tax information and has nothing to hide. SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter says both the office of the Public Protector and SARS, with an endorsement of the High Court in Pretoria, have agreed to hold in abeyance the implementation of a subpoena. The subpoena follows Mkhwebane’s demand that SARS give her the former president’s tax information. Kieswetter says taxpayers’ right to confidentiality has an overriding interest in the Tax Administration Act. Kieswetter says the Public Protector Act does not contain any provision that overrides the confidentiality provisions of the Act. He addressed the media in Pretoria earlier on Tuesday. Mkhwebane wants access to Zuma’s tax information as her office investigates a complaint by the Democratic Alliance (DA) that Zuma allegedly received payment from a security company just one month after he assumed the position of president. However, the South African Revenue Service is opposed to granting Mkhwebane access to Zuma’s tax records. Meanwhile Jacob Zuma is still recovering after being admitted to hospital two weeks ago. Zuma is said to have spent several days in an undisclosed Durban hospital. The nature of his ailment is also not known, but it’s believed he was seriously ill. His ill-health meant the former president could not appear before the Zondo Commission into State Capture. He was set to testify for a second time at the beginning of the week until Friday. Zuma’s first appearance at the commission was in July. Click video below:
