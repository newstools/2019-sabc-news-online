Twenty houses were damaged at Watervaal Correctional Services in Utrecht in northern KwaZulu-Natal when a tornado hit the area on Friday night.   Disaster management teams have been dispatched to assess the extent of the damage. 23 lives have been lost in the province due to weather-related incidents since October. Last week, tornados swept through Mpolweni in New Hanover and then Bergville in the province. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Senzelwe Mzila says so far no injuries have been reported. Mzila says they remain on alert because inclement weather conditions are expected to continue in the north-eastern parts of the province. “The MEC for COGTA Sipho Hlomuka has warned residents of the province following a report issued by the South African Weather Service indicating that inclement weather conditions are expected across the northern parts of the province and the interior. These reports indicate that there is a risk of severe thunderstorms which bring with them the risk of heavy rains, strong winds, and hail. Disaster management teams are on high alert and are monitoring areas that are prone to incidents.” Click on the videos below:
