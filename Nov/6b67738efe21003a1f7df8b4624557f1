Delegates have started to arrive at the DA headquarters in Bruma, Johannesburg, to elect the party’s interim leader and interim Federal chairperson.  The party’s Parliamentary leader, John Steenhuisen and member of Gauteng provincial legislature, Makashule Gana are contesting the interim leadership position. This comes after the resignations of Mmusi Maimane and Athol Trollip shortly after Helen Zille was elected Federal Council chairperson. 155 DA council members will be casting their vote for who they believe is suitable to lead the party until its elective Congress next year. Each candidate will have an opportunity to address council for five minutes and motivate why they believe they are the best person to occupy the office. The result will be announced on Sunday afternoon, with both newly elected interim leaders expected address the media shortly afterward.
