The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has rejected the appointment of Andre de Ruyter as new Eskom GCEO, saying it goes against the transformation programme. The Department of Public Enterprises announced De Ruyter’s appointment in a statement. The Department says De Ruyter will lead the re-organization of Eskom, including the separation of the power monopoly into three entities – generation, transmission and distribution. De Ruyter, who holds an LLB and MBA, is expected to take over in mid-January next year. Numsa General Secretary, Irvin Jim has lambasted the appointment as not doing enough for transformation in the country.  “We regard this as nothing less than a provocation. This constitutes a setback when it comes to the transformation agenda in the country. This is an insult to blacks and Africans in this country, that – to date – in this country since the democratic breakthrough, we do not have competent black women and black African who can occupy such a position.” However, Public Enterprises has expressed its confidence in the new appointment. De Ruyter is currently the CEO of NAMPAK, which is Africa’s largest packaging company. The Public Enterprises Ministry says in a statement that the appointment follows an exhaustive recruitment procedure. It says De Ruyter has an LLB and an MBA and has served in various senior positions in the corporate world including at Sasol. Acting Public Enterprises DG, Kgathatso Tlhakudi, “He’s an accomplished CEO with deep and wide experience in creating and managing high-performing listed businesses. Minister Pravin Gordhan would like to thank Mr De Ruyter for availing himself to take over this very difficult position during this very trying period at Eskom. Minister Gordhan is hopeful that the Eskom Board, the senior management team as well as officials within government will work together in realising the goal that has been set in the roadmap for Eskom recently published.” Watch for more:
