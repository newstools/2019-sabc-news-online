He says they are only waiting for instructions from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). “We are working very closely with the NPA. There are different legs that we are looking at, some of which have been completed with the NPA. We are just waiting for their instructions. If there are any in terms of information that might be needed, so there are also other investigations that are going to take some time to finalise.” Watch the related video below for more on the story:
