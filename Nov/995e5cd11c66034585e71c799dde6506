South African Airways (SAA) says it is about to start talking to unions about its restructuring plans, which include cutting more than 900 jobs to curb severe financial losses. SAA says it is also talking to more than 5 000 staff about the plans. Earlier on Tuesday, the unions including Numsa said SAA had not consulted them about its plans.

Government has been searching for an investor to take a stake in the airline, but its efforts have so far been unsuccessful. Watch the video below for more on the story:
