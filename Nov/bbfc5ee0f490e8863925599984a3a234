Deputy President, David Mabuza says government should do more to combat HIV/Aids. Mabuza has been chairing the extended National Aids Council as its chairperson in Secunda, Mpumalanga. He’s called on the civil society to assist in helping educate South Africans about the importance of living healthy life. Mabuza says everyone needs to access health services regardless for their location. “We need to move the response into a higher and more focused gear. Earlier this year the department of health reported that just over 838 000 people tested positive for HIV from January to December 2018.” “That is the highest incident rate recorded in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga.” Click video below:
