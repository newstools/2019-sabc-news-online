 The family of murdered University of Cape Town (UCT) student Uyinene Mrwetyana says it’s ready to establish a Foundation in her name. The family says the Uyinene Mrwetyana Foundation will be launched in Makanda, in the Eastern Cape, on November 29, 2019. Mrwetyana’s death in August this year shocked many across the country and highlighted the urgent need to fight gender-based violence. Her killer Luyanda Botha was sentenced to three life jail terms by the High Court in Cape Town on Friday. Family spokesperson Vuyani Mrwetyana says, “What he did he was trying to gain sympathy, we don’t have any sympathy for him, I must state that without any fear of contradiction, we don’t have any sympathy for him he did what he did – in fact this crime for us is a classic act of man’s inhumanity to man.”  Watch video below:
