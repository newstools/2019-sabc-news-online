The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in Gauteng says it is still trying to come to terms with the passing of Social Development MEC Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe. Nkabinde-Khawe died at Mulbarton Hospital in Alberton on Friday night. Prior to her appointment as MEC after this year’s general elections, Nkabinde-Khawe was a long serving member and chairperson of the Social Development Portfolio Committee in the Gauteng Legislature. The IFP is the latest party to pay tribute to the late MEC describing her as a passionate person. IFP Gauteng chairperson Bonginkosi Dhlamini says, “We remember her for her dedication and hard work and passion for the poor. We are passing our heartfelt condolences to the Nkabinde family and to her organisation the African National Congress (ANC) and South African Cultural Observatory (SACO) in particular… we say they must take where she has left and we really hope that she is in a better place.”
