Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani is getting to live another day, after the special council meeting set to discuss a motion of no confidence against him was adjourned on Monday. Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya adjourned the meeting after it degenerated into chaotic scenes with councillors singing struggle songs inside the council chambers. Earlier Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members walked out of the meeting, while African Independent Congress (AIC) and African National Congress (ANC) retracted their signatures on a petition sent to the speaker to have the special council. Bobani had replaced the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Athol Trollip as mayor after Trollip was forced out by the EFF and others. After the adjournment Bobani told SABC News that he will finish his term as the Mayor of the Metro. He says he’s not distracted by the motion of no confidence. “We know that in the next council meeting they are going to bring a motion of no confidence, every council meeting there is not a single council meeting the DA didn’t bring the motion of no confidence. We will defeat them, we already defeated them. They are not going to comeback to power until 2021.” DA Caucus leader, Athol Trollip says it will debate the motion in the council meeting and it won’t rest until Bobani is removed as the Mayor.
