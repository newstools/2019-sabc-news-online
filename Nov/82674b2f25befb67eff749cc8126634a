Parliament’s Justice Committee will officially nominate Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka to become the next Deputy Public Protector.  The term of the current deputy Public Protector, Kevin Malunga, comes to an end in December. 28 people applied to be the right hand person to Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkwebane. Only 7 made it to the shortlist. The committee has concluded that it would nominate Advocate Gcaleka to the National Assembly. A recommendation will then be made to the President for the appointment to be made. Gcaleka had a tough time during her interview, with opposition parties grilling her for staying on as adviser to former Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba, after a court found that he had lied under oath. Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Democratic Alliance (DA) favoured Moshoeshoe Moshoeshoe, an attorney at the South African Revenue Service. Meanwhile, the committee has resolved that neither Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba nor Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi should be reinstated in their positions at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The committee will recommend this to the National Assembly. Members of Parliament deliberated on the fate of the Jiba and Mrwebi after President Cyril Ramaphosa fired them based on the findings of the Mokgoro Inquiry. The inquiry, headed by retired Judge Yvonne Mokgoro, found the pair to be unfit to hold office. The recommendation will be tabled before the National Assembly next week. However, Jiba has already informed Parliament that she no longer wants to be reinstated to the position.
