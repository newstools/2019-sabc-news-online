Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise has agreed to the Inkatha Freedom Party’s (IFP) request to debate the current state of South African Airways (SAA). Staff at the state-owned entity have been on strike since last week. They are demanding an eight percent salary increase while the airline is offering five-point-nine percent, depending on the availability of funds. IFP Chief Whip Narend Singh made the request for the debate to get a briefing on the latest developments at SAA. “The issue of SAA and the continued strike is having serious impact not only on the economy but also the future of SAA as the national carrier. For these reasons I wrote to the Speaker last week Friday to request an urgent debate in Parliament to discuss this and for the minister to tell us exactly what is happening and what interventions are going to be put in place,” says Singh.
