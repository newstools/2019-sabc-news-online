The shortage of water supply in Hammanskraal north of Pretoria is continuing to affect businesses, health facilities, police stations and other public service points. This is despite the City of Tshwane having announced a plan of action. Residents say even though water supply has been restored, the water coming out of their taps is dirty and not safe for drinking.  Acting Chief Executive Officer of Jubilee Hospital, Olebogeng Modise says the situation is compelling them to refer some of the patients to other hospitals. “The main issue that we are facing is around sterilising our theatre equipment and we could not run our maternity unit. So based on that we’ve to close our theatre and refer some of the patients to Odi hospital for caesarean procedures but we are able to assist the ones that walk into the hospital. Our midwives and doctors were available to assess them and send them to Odi when there’s a need.”
