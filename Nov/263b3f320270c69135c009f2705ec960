Gautrain has advised commuters that there will be no train services between Centurion, Pretoria and Hatfield over the weekend. The train service said this is due to planned maintenance work on the southern end of the railway bridge where the Gautrain travels – spanning Eeufees Road in Pretoria. The company has stressed that this service is the only one that will be affected. Spokesperson Kesagee Nayager said Gautrain has put measures in place to assist affected commuters. “During this time – a bus service will operate at 30 minute intervals, and will transport passengers between the affected stations free of charge. The parking facilities at Pretoria and Hatfield stations will be available, and the airport service and trains between Park and Centurion stations will not be affected and will operate according to schedule.”
