European Union lawmakers approved an increase in US beef imports to the EU on Thursday, a move likely to ease transatlantic tensions. But they also criticized tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on metal imports and a threat he has made to target EU cars and car parts. The European Parliament voted by 457-140, with 71 abstentions, in favor of a plan to allow US farmers a larger share of an existing 45 000 tonne quota from 2020. The vote came with a resolution urging the removal of US tariffs on EU steel and aluminum, and the withdrawal of Trumpâ€™s threat to raise tariffs on EU cars. The agreement on beef is designed to settle a dispute that dates back to 1981 when the EU banned the use of growth hormones in meat across the 28-nation bloc, including in imports. The EU and the United States eventually concluded an agreement in 2009 to grant a quota for hormone-free beef imports, which currently stands at 45 000 tonnes. However, under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, the quota also had to be made available to non-US suppliers. Exporters from Australia and Uruguay, and more recently Argentina, decided to sell into the quota, pushing the US share from nearly 100% to 30%.
