Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says Treasury has developed what it calls a “National Health Insurance Financing Paper” which provides proper guidelines for the funding of the National Health Insurance. Mboweni was answering oral questions in the National Council of Provinces. The Minister says because of the current fiscal projections, the implementation of the envisaged universal health system might not be ready, as anticipated, by 2026. Mboweni says, “The National Health Insurance will be implemented at a pace that is affordable to South Africa given our current macro-economic outlook and constraint fiscal environment. Full implementation is likely to take longer than initially anticipated.” “The National Treasury has prepared a National Health Insurance financing paper which lays out various scenarios for financing potentials and the shortfalls for the National Health Insurance,” he adds. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance has handed in 87 000 public submissions to Parliament on the National Health Insurance Bill. Click here for more:
