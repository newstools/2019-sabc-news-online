South African Airways (SAA) says all affected passengers on cancelled regional and domestic flights will be rescheduled on Mango and SA Airlink flights where possible. SAA has extended the cancellation of regional and domestic flights until Monday. However, the embattled national carrier says it aims to resume international flights on Sunday from the OR Tambo International Airport. SAA call centre hours have been extended until midnight to accommodate passengers wanting to rebook flights or receive a refund. “All our ticketed passengers who are due to travel on Sunday and Monday to destinations in South Africa and to the rest of the African continent who are affected by flight cancellations on those days will be re-accommodated on Mango airlines and SA Airlink respectively,” says SAA spokesperson, Tlali Tlali.
