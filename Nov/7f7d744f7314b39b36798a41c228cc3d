There is still a heavy police presence in and around South African Airways (SAA) headquarters in Kempton Park east of Johannesburg where SAA workers are picketing. Numsa and the South Africa Cabin Crew Association are demanding an 8% salary increase while SAA is offering 5.9%, depending on the availability of funds. Unions are confident that its talks with SAA at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) will yield positive results. The airline also says it will implement its restructuring plan which will lead to the retrenchment of 900 staff. SAA workers expected to continue their protest action despite an intervention meeting with the CCMA, and unions say they will picket outside the offices until a solution is found.
