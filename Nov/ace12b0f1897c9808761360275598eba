The African National Congress (ANC) has deployed its heavy weights to Schweizer-Reneke this weekend to encourage residents to register ahead of by-elections. Those deployed to the municipality include National Executive Committee members Thandi Modise and Mamoloko-Kubayi Ngubane. Voter registration for the by-elections in the municipality will be conducted on Saturday and Sunday. The bi-elections follow the provincial government’s dissolution of the municipal council after the municipality was found to be unable to deliver services to the community due to internal party battles. The voter registration this weekend is in preparation for the January 14 and 15, 2020, where various political parties including the Democratic Alliance (DA), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Forum 4 Service Delivery will be battling for the leadership of the troubled Schweizer-Reneke, Mamusa Local Municipality. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the North West says is ready to conduct a voter registration exercise in the Mamusa Local Municipality in Schweizer-Reneke. IEC Provincial Electoral Commissioner, Dr Tumelontle Thiba said, “Twenty six voting stations will be opened from 08:00 in the morning to 17:00. We hope to work seamlessly because fortunately at Mamusa all voting stations are permanent. We have already acquired stations from land lords and we don’t foresee and problems whatsoever.”
