The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) has denied that bus drivers working for the Tshwane Bus Service have embarked on a strike. The union was reacting to a decision the City of Tshwane to suspend bus operations amid salary increase negotiations. Samwu Secretary Mpho Tladinyane says they are hoping to conclude negotiations on Wednesday. Tladinyane says, “We are not on strike at Samwu. What happened yesterday is we had a meeting with the employer. We applied for the employer to grant us time off so that we can address our workers and the employer granted us time off. We met the employer yesterday.”
