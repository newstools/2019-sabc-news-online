South African Airways(SAA) will brief the media on Tuesday afternoon at 1PM. The airline says the briefing will address, among others, an update on the ongoing strike, wage negotiations, restructuring and legal action against unions. SAA workers affiliated to the National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) and South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) have been on strike for five days. Workers are demanding an 8% salary increase and want the airline to stop retrenchments of over 900 employees. The airline has resumed with its international and regional flights this week. SAA’s Acting Chief Pilot Mpho Mamashela says there’s no plan on the table yet to recommence with local flights. Mamashela says: “The reason we have not started with our local flights is that we have adequate capacity within our SA carriers. Our sister airlines are there operating in SA taking a lot of people for us.”
