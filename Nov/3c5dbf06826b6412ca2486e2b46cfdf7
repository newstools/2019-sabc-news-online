McDonald’s Corp  said on Sunday that Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook was leaving the company, effective immediately, after a recent consensual relationship with an employee. The company said in a statement the board had determined that Easterbrook “violated company policy and demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee.” It added that Chris Kempczinski, most recently president of McDonald’s USA, was replacing him as CEO.
