The Democratic Alliance (DA ) says it will handover about 80 000 submissions to Parliament from civil society and members of the public who are objecting to the National Health Insurance (NHI). DA Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone and the party’s spokesperson on health are expected to lead a media briefing on the steps of the National Assembly on Monday morning. The DA says it has lobbied civil society and members of the public to take a stand and make their views heard through an online portal. She says the DA will demand that Parliament consider each and every submission during the process of considering the Bill. The DA’s handing over of thousand of submission objecting to the NHI Bill comes at a time when  Parliament’s Health Committee is conducting nationwide public hearings on the Bill. The committee has been in KwaZulu-Natal this weekend and is expected to move to the Eastern Cape to continue with public hearings.
