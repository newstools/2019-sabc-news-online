Police in Gauteng have confirmed that they’ve been struggling to locate convicted racist Vicki Momberg since a warrant for her arrest was issued in August. In June this year the High Court in Johannesburg dismissed Momberg’s appeal for her conviction and sentence. She was given 30 days in which to apply for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein and report to the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. She failed to report to the court, prompting officials to issue the warrant of arrest. The former real estate agent was sentenced to an effective two years in jail last year. This was after she was found guilty of crimen injuria for using the k-word at least 48 times against a black police officer who had come to her aid following a smash-and-grab incident in Johannesburg in 2016. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says police are yet to locate and arrest Momberg. “Police have visited two addresses, one in Bedfordview and one in Krugersdorp on numerous occasions, with the last visit as recent as this past week. Momberg was not at either of these addresses. We have a responsibility as the police to execute this warrant of arrest. Therefore our investigators will continue to trace Momberg until she is found.”
