Police say the discovery of a drug manufacturing lab on a farm in Phuthaditjhaba in the Free State could be linked to a syndicate operating in various parts of the country including the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. Police raided the farm in the eastern Free State and discovered manufacturing equipment and thousands of mandrax tablets worth millions of rands. Two people were arrested after fleeing the crime scene during the raid in Phuthaditjhaba, bringing the number of arrested suspected drug dealers to eleven after raids were also conducted in other provinces. National Police Spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo says a certain family in Gauteng is linked to these drug syndicates. “It has to be a syndicate, because these successes resulted from arrests and the discovery of laboratories made in Middleburg and Dobsonville in Soweto. On the discovery of the lab and the raid in Johannesburg, we found that all of these are linked to one family,” says Naidoo.
