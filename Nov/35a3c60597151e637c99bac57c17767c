Several Heads of State from different African countries have attended the inauguration of Botswana’s fifth president, Mokgwetsi Masisi, a short while ago. Masisi won the elections last week in what was considered to be fiercely contested elections in the history of Botswana. Amongst the dignitaries who are attending Friday’s inauguration are Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zambian president Edgar Lungu, as well as Filipe Nyusi of Mozambique. A South African delegation led by Minister Jackson Mthembu is also in attendance. The African National Congress (ANC) is also represented by its Secretary General Ace Magashule, who says they are here because they have a close relationship with Botswana.
