Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, has announced an improvement in Metrorail’s on-time performance. He was speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg on PRASA’s War Room Progress report. Mbalula says since the inception of the War Room – an initiative to address challenges in the passenger rail environment – the Department is heading towards their goal of 85% on-time performance. “Since the inception of the War Room, Metrorail’s on-time performance has improved and we are on course to achieving our goal of 85%. The morning peak at the start of the War Room was 49% and by the end of the last week, on time performance had increased to 60%. The afternoon peak on the other hand increased from 55% to 63%,” says Mbalula. Mbalula, says millions of rand has been invested to  increase the security of railways and the prevention of vandalism. “Security services have been affected as a result of this intervention because we are not looking at a temporary intervention. We are looking at holistic long-lasting intervention to ensure the safety of passengers, but also protecting our own projects that we’ve got in the system that have been depleted as a result of theft. So our billions, millions, investment in security must be able to produce the result and benefit to the users of transport,” says Mbalula.  Watch related video below:
