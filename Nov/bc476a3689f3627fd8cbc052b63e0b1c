The man accused of murdering his wife and two children is on Friday morning expected back in the Protea Magistrateâ€™s Court in Soweto. Forty-eight year-old Sydney Nhlapo was arrested after the discovery of the bodies of his 47-year-old wife and her two children in shallow graves at two separate locations in Soweto early this month. They had been missing since November 1st. Following the disappearance of his wife and two children, the community forced Nhlapo to reveal what had happened to the trio. He led police to the bushes in Zondi near the Jabulani hostel where the body of his wife was found. They then proceeded to the second grave at Mofolo Park where the bodies of the children were discovered. Nhlapo is now facing three counts of murder. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says given the seriousness of the crimes, they will oppose his bail application. The case was postponed to Friday for further investigations and an identity parade.
