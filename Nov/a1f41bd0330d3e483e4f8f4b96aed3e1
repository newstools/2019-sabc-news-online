The Executive Mayor of Tshwane, Stevens Mokgalapa, says the audio recording of him discussing senior official in the Tshwane Metro council with MMC of Roads and Transport, Sheila Senkunbegu, has been tampered with to make it sound as if they are having an affair. Mokgalapa opened cases of illegal surveillance, distortion of content, blackmail, extortion and defamation. Mokgalapa says they were threatened last week that the recording would be released if four officials – who are on suspension for violations of the Municipal Finance Management Act – were not reinstated. Mokgalapa denied that he and Senkunbuge have a romantic relationship and were only gossiping in the recording and that the recording was manipulated. ” Now we are talking about the investigation that will be coming and those are the things that will be explained to the investigating officer when this matter is being addressed, because then there will be a context that will be put forward to ensure it is recorded in the proper context. That is why one of the charges is distortion, because it is distorting the discussion.”
