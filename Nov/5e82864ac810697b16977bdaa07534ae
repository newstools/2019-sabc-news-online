The High Court in Pretoria is hearing heads of argument in the delinquency case of former South African Airways board chairperson Dudu Myeni. In 2017,  the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) and the SAA Pilots Association brought a case against Myeni to have her declared a delinquent director. The case has been postponed four times in the past two months. Myeni has also failed to appear in court on a number of occasions claiming that she could not afford the cost of transportation as well as legal representatives. Judge Ronel Tolmay has ruled that the court will hear three applications in the case against Myeni. The first application relates to amendments of Myeni’s plea, the second is an application for a Joinder, in which Myeni’s legal representatives argue that other directors at SAA should stand trial with her as they also participated in some of the questionable decisions made at SAA. The third application is one for a special plea.
