South African consumers have been advised to spend with caution and make wise decisions as they prepare to shop for big sales on Black Friday next week. Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States. It has become a big trading day that has gone global as customers flock to shops, with some camping outside the stores to get the best items for less. Head of Card Issuing for a major bank, Ethel Nyembe, says it’s important to know what it is that a person needs. “People must really shy away from stocking up on goods they do not need” “Do not take cash because once cash is lost you have lost an opportunity whereas with your card, you can always stop your card and find another card.” “We are now starting to see mobile shopping which means you can always spend in the comfort of your own home and your goods will be delivered at home. You don’t have to sleep outside, you don’t have to go through all the pushing and shoving,” she adds. WATCH BELOW:
