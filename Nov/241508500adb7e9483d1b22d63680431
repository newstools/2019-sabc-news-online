Deputy President David Mabuza has also called on civil society to play their role in communities to teach citizens the importance of healthy lifestyles. He says government should do more to combat the scourge of the HIV  pandemic. Mabuza is chairing the extended South African National Aids Council in Secunda, Mpumalanga. The extended plenary is the first to take place in the 6th administration. Mabuza has also called on civil societies to play their role in the communities to teach citizens the importance of healthy lifestyles. He adds that everyone needs to access health services regardless of their location. “We need to move the response into a higher and more focused gear.” “Earlier this year the department of health reported that just over 838 000 people tested positive for HIV from January to December 2018. This is the highest incident rate recorded in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga,” says Mabuza. This story was edited as the original story had the Deputy President saying there was an increase in HIV infections, which was incorrect.  Related video below
