Tributes are pouring in for entrepreneur and philanthropist Donald Gordon, who has passed away in Johannesburg, on Thursday. He was 89. Gordon has been hailed as a disruptor in the property and insurance industry. Gordon was the founder of Liberty Life and Sandton City. In a statement the board of Liberty described Gordon as a “visionary leader, entrepreneur and philanthropist” who made an “immense” contribution to the industry and the country. He was born in Johannesburg in 1930 and qualified as a chartered accountant at Wits. Businessman Ndaba Ntsele says he benefited immensely from Gordon’s innovative insurance products when establishing his businesses in the 1980s. “During apartheid the policies from Old Mutual were mainly life policies, he came up with endowment policies which you could use at a certain time, borrow to start a business…one of the biggest disruption he decentralised and started Sandton, it was a farm.
