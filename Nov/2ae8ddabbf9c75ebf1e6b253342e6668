South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) says the survival of South African Airways (SAA) depends on management’s commitment to implement various anti-corruption and cost-saving measures. SAA says it is working towards having all its systems operating fully by Sunday evening, following a week-long strike that halted operations at the national carrier. The strike by members affiliated to National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and SACCA ended after a wage agreement was reached on Friday. Workers will get a 5,9% increase and a further 2,9% when the airline returns to profitability. SACCA President, Zazi Sibanyoni-Muga, explains, “If there is no real commitment to it, of course we are back to square one and that we won’t allow. We have to get this working and get rid of these evergreen contracts. We have to get the right people in the right positions for once at SAA. We can’t keep going on like this. People are scared about their future and their children’s’ future. It’s called the survival of SAA.” Watch related videos:
