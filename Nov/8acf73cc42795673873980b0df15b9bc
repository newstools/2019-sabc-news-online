The state has disputed claims by former President Jacob Zuma‘s legal team that former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Bulelani Ngcuka abused his powers and that he had political motives in the arms deal case. The Pietermaritzburg High Court is hearing arguments for leave of appeal by Zuma and his co-accused, the French arms company, Thales. Zuma’s defense team has told the court that the lengthy delays in the corruption trial lies squarely in the hands of the NPA. Last month the court dismissed their application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Advocate Andrew Breitenbach was appearing for the state. “So, we submit that Mr Zuma’s contention that this court should have found that by explaining to the public why he decided not to prosecute Mr Zuma, that Mr Ngcuka was playing a political role or abusing his prosecutorial powers to advance political outcome is baseless. It is underpinned by no facts whatsoever. It is comprehensively disputed by Mr Ngcuka in his affidavit and also by Mr Downer in his affidavit.” Click below for more on the story:
