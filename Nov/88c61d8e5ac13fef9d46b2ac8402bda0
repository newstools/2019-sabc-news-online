Ten foreign nationals have been arrested following the discovery of a counterfeit spice factory in Meyerton, south of Johannesburg. Those arrested were handed over to Immigration Officers from the Department of Home Affairs for verification of their status in the country. Eight are Mozambican while the other two are Chinese. Over 600 other suspects were also arrested for various crimes in the Sedibeng District as part of the police’s Operation O Kae Molao. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says: ” The operation continued to confiscate the counterfeit spices worth millions of rand. On the property, police also confiscated bags of different types of powder used to produce the illicit spices, as well as equipment and machinery suspected of being utilised for processing and packaging.”
