The application for leave to appeal by former President Jacob Zuma and his co-accused Thales has been dismissed with costs. The order of the court has been handed down by the full bench of judges in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Zuma and Thales had been asking the Pietermaritzburg High Court to allow them to appeal last month’s ruling in which the Court dismissed their application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Meanwhile, Thales has indicated that the company has also petitioned the Constitutional Court directly. Zuma faces charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering related to the arms deal together with co-accused Thales. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) opposed Zuma’s application, saying the prospects of him succeeding at the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) are slim.  .
