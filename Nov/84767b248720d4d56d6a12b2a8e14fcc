Rescuers have called off the search for a nine year old boy who was swept away while walking across a low-level bridge at the Nonoti River at Darnall at KwaDukuza on the KwaZulu Natal north coast. Paramedics and Search and Rescue teams abandoned the search due to storms which are currently lashing the province. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst says police from KwaDukuza are keeping the boy’s parents informed. Herbst says, “The extensive search was done by water rescue specialists from IPSS Medical Rescue all the way to the end of the river and unfortunately they’ve had zero results. The search was suspended due to lightning conditions and bad weather conditions that came up. The search will continue again with the necessary authorities in the morning to find the missing boy.”
