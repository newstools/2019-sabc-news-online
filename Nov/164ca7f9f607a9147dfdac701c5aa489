The community of Merweville in the Central Karoo is experiencing serious water shortages. The town is located in the Beaufort West Municipality and has a population of less than 2 000 people. A spokesperson for the local Municipality, Marlene Hendriks, says three of the town’s six boreholes have dried up.   She says the municipality is currently investigating where more boreholes can be drilled. Hendriks says they will transport 300 five litre bottles of water to the town today, to set up an emergency supply room. “The municipality contacted the Western Cape Provincial Disaster Management and asked them for water for Merweville. We also contacted Gift of the Givers. The community must take note that no water will be provided from 10pm in the evening until 5am the next morning, to ensure the water needs of the community can be met during the day. The community will be limited to 12 kilolitres of water per month and is kindly requested to use water sparingly,” explains Hendriks.
