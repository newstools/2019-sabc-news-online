The ANC in the Amathole region in the Eastern Cape has welcomed the arrest of 10 suspects linked to the Siyenza toilet scandal. They were arrested for allegedly colluding to access funds in the Amathole district municipality by flouting procurement procedures. Nine of the suspects have been granted bail of R40 000 each and one accused was granted bail of R10 000. They face charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering amounting to more than R600 million awarded to the Siyenza Group to build toilets across the province. It was discovered that over R200-million was paid by the time the project was put on hold. The accused include former Amathole district municipality manager, Chris Mangqangwana, former CFO, Mpumelelo Shezi and Siyenza group director, Bongani Mpeluza. NPA spokesperson Luxolo Tyhali says bail was not opposed and the case was postponed to the 5th of February next year. ANC Amathole regional secretary Thembalethu “Terris” Ntuthu says the law should take its course. “We really appreciate the work done by the law enforcement agencies in this case. The Hawks for arresting those who are alleged to be involved in wrong doing in the Amathole District Municipality toilet tender. We have no other option as the ruling party but to just accept and appreciate the actions so we don’t see anything wrong done by the law enforcement agencies.”
