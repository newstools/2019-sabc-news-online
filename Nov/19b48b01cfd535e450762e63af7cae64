President Cyril Ramaphosa has strengthened the countryâ€™s administration of justice by appointing at least 15 judges of which eight of them are women. These justices were interviewed last month by the Judicial Service Commission chaired by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The judges are to begin their new appointments on either the 1st of December this year or the beginning of next year.
