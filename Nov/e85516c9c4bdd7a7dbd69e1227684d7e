The South African Weather Service has issued a second alert for Durban and surrounding areas. The weather services say people should brace themselves for more severe thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday. Persistent rain and heavy rainfall has killed two people at Inanda outside Durban when the structure of their house collapsed in on them. Weather Forecaster Stacy Colborne says, “We do have a warning out for severe thunderstorms over most part of the KZN for today. Moving on to tomorrow we are expecting wide spread showers and thundershowers over the north eastern part of KZN otherwise scattered everywhere else.” “So, with severe thunderstorm warnings for the north eastern part as well as the eastern part including Durban for tomorrow.” The M4 between Umhlanga and the Sibaya Circle north of Durban which was closed due on Monday due to heavy rains will re-open after two weeks said eThekwini Metro Police. EThekwini Metro Police spokesperson, Parboo Sewpersad, has urged motorists to use alternative routes, and says the road is badly damaged and repairs will take time due to poor weather conditions. “The Department of transport worked last night and put some hard closures in place, these closures are expected to be in place until further notice. It appears that the closures will be there for a good few weeks. Motorists are urged to use alternative route such as the M41, R102 and the N2.” More rains are forecast for KwaZulu Natal for the coming weeks.
