Outgoing Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, has called on the future leaders of the City of Johannesburg to help ensure that they rid the metro of counterfeit goods. Mashaba vacates his position on Wednesday with a new mayor expected to be voted in on Thursday. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has nominated its regional leader, Musa Novela, as its mayoral candidate. The Democratic Alliance (DA), which currently leads the coalition government in the city, has selected Finance MMC, Funzi Ngobeni and the African National Congress (ANC) is yet to announce its candidate. Mashaba – who joined police on a raid in the CBD this year where counterfeit goods worth millions were confiscated – says criminal syndicates need to be rooted out. “The counterfeit goods worth millions are coming into our country. We need to fight this as South Africans because these criminal syndicates are bringing in medication and food. There are inspectors who said Mayor, please speak to our government otherwise a few years down the line we will have a health catastrophe.” Related video below
