Tshwane Member of the Mayoral Committee for Transport and Roads Sheila Senkubuge says she is being targeted because she is a successful female politician. This follows the leaking of an audio recording in which she and Executive Mayor Steven Mokgalapa can be heard gossiping about senior officials. Makgalapa and Senkubuge have denied having an affair, adding that their spouses are aware of the recording and that four former officials who are currently on suspension were allegedly blackmailing them. Senkubuge says the DA in Tshwane is attracting a great deal of attention. “I don’t think it comes as a mistake that after I recently win two key awards, nationally, the most influential women in local government and then the woman in excellence and leadership at the woman in transport awards. I don’t think it ‘s a mistake that a salacious accusation such as this would then drop. We are in the nature of politics. I think that sometimes when you raise your head and you are running hard and your department is performing excellently, it puts you in a position of people wanting to gun for you.”
