The Social Security Agency (SASSA) has warned grant beneficiaries to be vigilant of misleading information  as the festive season approaches. It says vulnerable members of society are prone to becoming targets to scammers and criminals. SASSA has also reminded beneficiaries that their monies for December will be available as early as the 28th of November. SASSA spokesperson,  Paseka Letsatsi, has urged beneficiaries not to provide their personal details to anyone “This thing of us releasing money early, to the old people in particular, is for them to avoid the rush. We know that there are those who take advantage and will call beneficiaries demanding their pin codes, asking for their ID numbers. From SASSA, we are saying that beneficiaries must know that we will at no stage call them and ask them for their personal information,” says Letsatsi.  Click link for full interview:
