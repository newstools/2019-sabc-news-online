The South African Weather Service says the weather in KwaZulu-Natal is expected to return to normal in the coming week. This is after weeks of persistent and heavy rainfall that caused widespread flooding. The national Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department put the death toll due to flooding, tornadoes and lightning strikes since 25 October at 20. However, the provincial department revised the figure to 19. Forecaster Stacy Colborne says afternoon thundershowers are expected for most of next week. She says this is normal during summer in KwaZulu-Natal. “Tomorrow (Monday) morning, we are expecting some rainfall to occur, but the majority of the rainfall should be gone by midday and then from Tuesday into the weekend you can expect to go back to your afternoon showers and thundershowers. Obviously, with the thunderstorm activity there is a chance for it to go severe, but we monitor it as it happens.” Watch the video below for more on the story:  Meanwhile, the eThekwini Municipality has warned against swimming near the mouth of rivers after the recent heavy rains. This is after the suspected drowning of an eight-year- old boy in the Umkomaas River. The boy disappeared just 20 metres from the beach. The municipality has called on people to only swim in demarcated areas where lifeguards are on duty.
