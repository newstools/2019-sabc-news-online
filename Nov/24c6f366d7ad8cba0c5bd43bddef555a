Police Minister Bheki Cele says the suspect behind the murder of an African National Congress Youth League member during a rally in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria a week ago, has been arrested. Lethabo Nkoana, 25 years old, was shot and killed during an argument between delegates. The suspect is said to have driven off in a grey BMW with an unknown registration. Cele, who also attended the funeral service in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, says more arrests are imminent. “I spoke to the commander of this cluster, General Mthombeni to put a special team to look at this. Yesterday (Friday), we arrested one of the people we believe pulled the trigger that has killed this young boy. We are looking for more going forward, and will be appearing in court on Monday.”
