KwaZulu-Natal authorities are racing to check on any damage after a second tornado in a week struck the midlands. The latest twister swept through Bergville. On Tuesday, a tornado smashed into New Hanover,  causing widespread destruction and claiming at least two lives. Authorities have warned all KwaZulu-Natal residents to remain in a place of safety as severe thunderstorms are expected at Amajuba, Umzinyathi, Ilembe and the eThekwini Metro. The Weather Service has confirmed the formation of the latest tornado started out as a funnel cloud. Forecaster Ayanda Nsele, “The South African Weather Service has confirmed that indeed a tornado did hit the Bergville area between 11h30 and 12 this afternoon. The tornado occurred around the Eskom power station. There has not been any reports of any damages caused, we don’t have that information yet.” Meanwhile, Commuter train services have been suspended in the province as heavy rains continue.  KwaZulu-Natal authorities say Thursday’s predicted thunderstorm is likely to be worse than the province’s April storms. At least 16 people have died since October in heavy rains and storms. PRASA and Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal PR manager Thabile Kunene says the service is suspended until further notice. Kunene has urged commuters to use alternative transport to reach their destinations. “All corridors are suspended due to the heavy rains and our tracks and railway lines are flooded. We cannot operate at the moment until further notice due to the safety of our commuters and our staff as well. We urge all commuters to take other alternative transport so that they will be safe at home.” For the latest click below:
