Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande has called on students who wish to apply for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to use National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) centres to apply for next year’s funding. NSFAS has entered into partnership with the NYDA to use their centres to assist applicants who have not yet applied, especially those who do not have internet access and those in rural areas. “The NYDA offices will be opened, tomorrow, Saturday, 30 November 2019 from 08:00 to 12:00 as part of the last push before the closing of applications at midnight. It is only a day left before the closing of the 2020 applications and anyone who has not as yet applied to further their studies for the 2020 academic year at any public university or TVET college in South Africa should take advantage of this arrangement and apply,” says Ministerial spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi.
