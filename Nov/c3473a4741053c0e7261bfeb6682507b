The man arrested in connection with the murder of his wife and the woman’s two children is expected to make his first appearance in the Protea Magistrates court in Soweto on Friday morning. This follows the discovery of the body of a 47-year-old woman and her two children aged 10 and 11 in shallow graves at two separate locations in Soweto on Wednesday. The deceased had been missing since last Friday. The 48-year old man was arrested this week after handing himself over to police. He led police to the bush in Zondi near Jabulani Hostel where the body of the woman was found. The suspect then led the police to the second scene at Mofolo Park, where the bodies of the children were discovered. Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko has condemned the incident. Spokesperson for the MEC, Pinkie Numa says, “This particular incident happens just a few weeks before we observe the 16 Days for no violence against women and children, as a country and as the Gauteng government; part of the activities that we’ll be hosting during the 16 days is an Imbizo Namadoda  (Meeting with Men) where we want to emphasise as government that men are supposed to be protectors of their families and not be the ones that actually violate them.” –Additional reporting Sashin Naidoo.
