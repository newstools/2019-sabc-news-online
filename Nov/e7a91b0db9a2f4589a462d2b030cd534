President Cyril Ramaphosa says that government is working hard to address the economic challenges being experienced in the country. He has cited the investment conference held recently as part of efforts to build and grow the economy. Ramaphosa believes that his administration will revitalise the economy amid concerns  that South Africa could be downgraded to junk status by the Moody’s ratings agency early in 2020. Ramaphosa, who is also President of the African National Congress (ANC), was giving the O.R. Tambo memorial lecture at Ga-Seleka outside Lephalale in Limpopo. “Right now we’re going through challenging economic moments and every country, comrades, goes through challenging economic moments. Many countries around the world have had their share of challenging economic moments. We are also having that but we are not sitting down and doing nothing we are taking steps to address all these challenges. We are making sure that we mobilise all the investments to our economy.”
