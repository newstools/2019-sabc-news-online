Public Works and Infrastructure minister, Patricia De Lille says cities are becoming more dysfunctional due to increasing urbanisation. De Lille was speaking at the fourth Global Parliament of Mayors in Durban, where international mayors and regional leaders gathered. They discussed how cities can be better equipped to deal with issues of rapid urbanisation and climate change. De Lille says South African urban design is problematic. She says poor people are often forced to live as much as 70 kilometres from where they work.
