Some economists say there’s room for the Reserve Bank to lower the repo rate shortly. They say this is because inflation is at its lowest in eight years. On Wednesday, Statistics South Africa announced that the headline consumer price index fell to 3.7 per cent in October, down from 4.1 per cent the month before. In September, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent following a 25 basis points cut. The South African Reserve Bank’s policy committee is meeting on Thursday for the last time in 2019.
