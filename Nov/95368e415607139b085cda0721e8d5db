Outgoing Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he has mixed emotions as he vacates his post. A new Mayor will be elected on Thursday following Mashaba’s resignation after the ascendency of Helen Zille as DA Federal Council Chairperson. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has nominated its regional leader, Musa Novela, as its mayoral candidate. The African National Congress (ANC) is yet to name its candidate. Watch interview below:  The Democratic Alliance (DA), which currently leads the coalition government in the city, has selected Finance Member of Mayoral Committee, Funzi Ngobeni. Mashaba says his aim was to serve the residents of the city. “What a sad, emotional, mixed emotions day for me. It is unfortunate; I would have loved to have finished my term, for two years to serve our residents. I joined to serve the public office and the residents – not to serve political parties. Once you try that with me and expect me to serve political parties, this is not negotiable.”
