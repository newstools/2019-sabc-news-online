The unions affiliated to SAA employees currently on strike are expected to brief the media in Johannesburg at midday, to update on teh status of their negotiations with South African Airways (SAA) at the CCMA.  However, the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA), the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and SAA do not appear to have made any progress. This is because the airline’s management wants another union, the National Transport Movement (NTM) to join the wage talks. SAA members who belong to the unions have embarked on the strike which started on Friday.  Employees are demanding an 8% wage increase while SAA is offering 5.9%, depending on the availability of funds.  NUMSA national spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says, “The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Cabin Crew Association will be briefing the workers on the section 150 mediation, which took place under the auspices of the CCMA between unions and South African Airways management yesterday (Saturday). We are inviting media houses to the picket line at the SAA airways park at the OR Tambo for an update on these talks and a way forward.” Click on the video below:
