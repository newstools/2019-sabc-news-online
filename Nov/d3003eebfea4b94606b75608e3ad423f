The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board Chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini, says the board resolved to engage the State Security Agency (SSA) to help the SABC protect its confidential information and not to spy on staff members as alleged by the Sunday Times. An article published in the newspaper alleges that the SSA has been brought in to spy on staff members to find those responsible for leaking sensitive information to the media. “There was no decision taken to spy on our people. That we’ll never do. We respect the constitution of the country. The truth of the matter  is that we haven’t even had a meeting with the SSA. I’m mandated as a chairperson to engage with the SSA to help us explore other methods to protect our confidential information. That meeting has not taken place (you haven’t heard) we haven’t yet (you haven’t engaged with the state security) we haven’t had a meeting with them. So for the Sunday Times to go out and say we’ve taken a decision as a board to spy on our people, that is misleading, it is false and we won’t accept it,” says Makhathini. Watch video below:  :
