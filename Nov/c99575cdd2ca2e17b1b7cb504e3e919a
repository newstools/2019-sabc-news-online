KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nohlanhla Khoza has applauded the High Court in Pietermaritzburg for handing down the maximum sentence to a father who hanged his four children. Sibusiso Mpungose who also faces a rape charge in another matter, was sentenced to four life terms on Wednesday. He told the court that that he killed his children because he suspected his wife of having an extra-marital affair. Khoza who also attended the proceedings said she hopes the sentence will send a strong warning to those who think they can get away with such heinous crimes. “It’s a victory to all South African women, it’s a victory to the families. In fact this guy shows no remorse. When he was about to leave court he swore at the families who were in court. We appreciate the manner in which this case has been handled…” “We appreciate that this man has been sentenced to life and I hope that it will send a message to anyone who might think of doing the same,” added Khoza.
