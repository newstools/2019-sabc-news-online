Consumers are being warned against falling into a debt trap as festive season shopping kicks off at the end of the month. Black Friday, which falls on the 29th of November, is the day after the US holiday of Thanksgiving, regarded as the first day of the Christmas shopping season, on which retailers make many special offers.   South Africans have embraced Black Friday with enthusiasm. But Debt Rescue CEO Neil Roets has some advice for consumers. “The best advice that I can give anybody with regards to Black Friday is plan on what you want to buy, look at how much is going to cost. Leave your bank cards, just take the amount of cash that item costs with you and go and buy it. So that you can control yourself and manage yourself with regards to all the temptation going on around you in the shops because that will happen,” adds Roets.
