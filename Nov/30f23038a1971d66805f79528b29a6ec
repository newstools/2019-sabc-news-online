AfriForum has filed a complaint of hate speech against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Secretary-General Godrich Gardee with the Human Rights Commission. This follows his ‘limpet mines’ tweet. Gardee took to social media to state that the mines should be hidden at the venue of an upcoming event of Pastor Angus Buchan in Pretoria. Afriforum earlier this week also laid criminal charges of incitement to violence against Gardee at the Lyttelton police station in Centurion. Buchan had announced the event planned for next year and remarked that only “boers and Jews have a covenant with God “. Buchan later apologised saying the remarks were misunderstood. Gardee has also withdrawn his statement and posted an apology. Afriforum’s Ernst van Zyl says they will continue with the criminal matter against Gardee despite his retraction. “The disturbing tweet by the SG of the EFF seems to indicate that the party believes it can incite violence against South African citizens without having to face any consequences.” “Violent threats of this nature have no place in our society especially not from the SG of the third largest party in SA and also taking into account this person has 133 000 followers on twitter.”
