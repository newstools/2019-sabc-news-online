Zimbabwe’s Vice president Constantino Chiwenga has returned from China where he spent months receiving medical treatment. No details of Chiwenga’s illness has been disclosed. Chiwenga, who has previously received treatment in India, was in a hospital in South Africa before being taken to China. The former Army Chief led what was called operation legacy in 2017 that led to the late Zimbabwean former president Robert Mugabe’s resigning from office. There have been speculations that the relationship between Chiwenga and President Emmerson Mnangagwa is frosty. However, the government has denied these allegations. Chiwenga was welcomed by the Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe upon arrival at Robert Mugabe International Airport. Click on the video below:
