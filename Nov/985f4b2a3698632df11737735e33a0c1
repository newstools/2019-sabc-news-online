The protracted legal battle for the ownership of the Shembe church is set to be argued in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Mduduzi Shembe is appealing a High Court ruling that declared his late uncle Vela Shembe, the lawful leader of the church in 2018. Mduduzi is the son of the church founder Vimbeni Shembe who died in 2011 â€“ and the on-going battle over the succession has divided millions of Shembe congregants. The seemingly never-ending succession battle for the Shembe church has run into millions of rand in legal fees. Vela took Mduduzi to court after it emerged that church leaders had appointed Mduduzi as the successor to late leader, Vimbeni. Arguments between the warring factions will be heard by a full bench of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein.  Click video below for more:
