Four suspects are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court in connection to the abduction of the daughter of a prominent Pinetown trucking tycoon in May this year. The suspects are said to have been involved in the disappearance of Sandra Moonsamy 45, who was rescued in Mpumalanga last week Thursday. Moonsamy was allegedly found bound in chains at a house at eMalahleni, Mpumalanga and not Mamelodi as originally reported. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said, “The charges that will be referred against them for now is the charges of kidnapping. But then based on the ongoing investigation, police might be adding more charges – and if there are any other attempts in relation to bail, of course we will oppose it.”
