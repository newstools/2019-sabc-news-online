Gauteng police are investigating a shooting incident at Temba stadium in Hammanskraal, which left a 25-year-old African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) member injured and recovering in hospital.  Another person died on the scene. The incident happened on Saturday night during an ANC Youth League rally in the area. Gauteng Police spokesperson, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, says preliminary reports have suggested that an argument broke out between delegates at the rally before the shooting. Peters says the suspect is said to have driven off in a grey BMW with an unknown registration. “I can confirm that there was a shooting incident yesterday at Temba stadium. The police are investigating. We are not at liberty as the police to disclose or confirm identity of the victim at this stage. So we are still in search of a suspect because the suspect escaped in a grey BMW after the shooting incident where one victim passed away on the scene and the other one was rushed to hospital,” says Peters. Peters urged anyone with information of the suspect and his whereabouts to contact police in Temba or call the Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
