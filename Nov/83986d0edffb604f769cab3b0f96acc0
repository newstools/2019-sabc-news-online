A memorial for veteran broadcaster, Xolani Gwala takes place on Wednesday at the Rivonia Catholic Church in Sandton, north of Johannesburg. The service is scheduled to start at 10 o’clock on Wednesday morning. Gwala passed away last Friday following a battle with colon cancer. He will be laid to rest at his place of birth in  Impendle in Kwa-Zulu Natal on Saturday. After his diagnosis Gwala had started campaigning for more affordable cancer treatment, especially for poor people. He had gone into remission, but his cancer returned and treatment in Israel failed to halt the progression of the disease. Family Spokesperson Matsi Modise says, “Xolani Gwala had a charity close to his heart, which was the Teddy Bear Foundation and as a family we ask that all the flowers that people wish to send to us, or any donations, could they be directed to the Teddy Bear Foundation, you can find their contact details on the internet.” “So if you do wish to pay your respects or you want to send flowers or donations, we’d love for it to go to the Teddy Bear Foundation because it was very close and dear to Xolani,” Modise adds.
