Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, says the number of learners not yet placed in Grade one and eight for 2020 has been reduced from 34 000 to 9 000. This after the department extended its placement period to the end of this month. Lesufi was speaking during a media briefing in Johannesburg. “We anticipate that we are going to get over 18 000 additional people that want to apply for late registration. For now, our decision is that we will deal with that aspect when we have concluded the placement of the 9 000 remaining learners. When we open for late registration, around January, we are only going to open for schools that are not full. Those schools that are full will be blanked out of the registration process,” says Lesufi. Lesufi says Centurion and Alberton are the most difficult areas for placement, “We want to demonstrate for you that from that time when we indicated we’ve got challenges of placement of 34 000 learners we have reduced that to 9 000, to be specific 9618. 9 300 are grade one. That’s where we want to put our energy into ensuring that there’s no grade one learner without school.” Meanwhile, new exam dates have been set for matric learners who were unable to write exams due to loadshedding. Lesufi has called on affected learners to take advantage of the new dates. He says he is happy with the way the matric exams have been going, “Besides the loadshedding challenges, we had a smooth exam. We have agreed with national that those who could not write when there was loadshedding, a new date has been scheduled for them to write. Those who feel they didn’t write properly in Gauteng,  we encourage learners who didn’t conclude exams on that day to go write exams so we can conclude this process.” Click link for more on the story:
