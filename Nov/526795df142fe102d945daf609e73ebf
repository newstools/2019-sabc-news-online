President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured potential investors that plans are in place to support Eskom. He says a new Eskom CEO will be appointed in the next few days while the power utility is expected to be revamped soon. Eskom owes its creditors over R400 billion and does not generate enough cash to even pay the interest on its debt. It will be split into three subsidiaries namely – generation, transmission and distribution.
