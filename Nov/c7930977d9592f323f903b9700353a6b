Former International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane has defended the appointment of Bruce Koloane as South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands in 2014. This after he facilitated the illegal landing of a Gupta plane at Waterkloof Air Force base the year before. Koloane’s appointment was widely criticised at the time. But Nkoana-Mashabane says he was an experienced diplomat, and by then had served his punishment.  A plane with private wedding guests landing at Waterkloof – the use of which is reserved for the executive and eminent guests. It caused an outcry and national embarrassment. Nkoana-Mashabane says she only learnt after media reports of Koloane’s involvement in the matter. Koloane was slapped with a two month suspension and a six month final warning for his role in the debacle. Testifying before the Commission of inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, she says former President Jacob Zuma was visibly angry when his name was mentioned during the controversial landing of the Gupta plane at Waterkloof. Nkoana-Mashabane says she spoke to Zuma  who subsequently ordered her to find out who might have mentioned his name to the ministers of Defence and Transport with regard to the landing of the plane. Bruce Koloane, who was the Chief of State for Protocol then, was behind the naming of Zuma. Koloane was later appointed South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands. “He looked very very angry – on the day he was to fly to Brazzaville and things were still disconnected there – he just shook his head and I felt sorry for him. But having said that we have an opportunity to get our security proper. Presidents come and go – but South Africa must remain secure, ” Nkoana-Mashabane explained. The commission will continue on Monday with evidence expected from intelligence senior officials.
