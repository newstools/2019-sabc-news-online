The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has rejected claims published in a Sunday newspaper article that the public broadcaster intends to spy on its staff. The article in the Sunday Times alleges that the State Security Agency has been brought in to spy on staff members in order to stem leaks to the media. The public broadcaster has slammed the reports that the SABC Board took a decision “to spy on its staff members”. In a statement the SABC says the claims that the board took the decision are totally false and no such decision has been taken. The statement further expressed concerned that the newspaper used confidential board minutes to sensationalise and deliberately distort information, thereby causing panic and a trust deficit between the SABC Board and employees.
