The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the decision of the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) not to withdraw the crimen injuria charge against businessman Adam Catzavelos. Catzavelos appeared in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, north of Johannesburg earlier on Tuesday. In August, the businessman submitted representations to the NDPP to have the charges against him dropped after the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions denied his representations to withdraw the charges. However, in the same month, Catzavelos reached a settlement agreement with the Human Rights Commission in another case relating to the video. This follows a self-recorded video of Catzavelos in which he used the K-word while on holiday in Greece in August last year. EFF’s Mandisa Mashego says, “We are satisfied that the National Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the application for the charges to be dropped. As we always previously stated, we don’t believe that jurisdiction will be a qualifying excuse for not hearing the matter here in South Africa for many reasons, which I am sure the Director of Public Prosecutions has already alluded to. So, we are looking forward to the trial itself.” Click video below:
