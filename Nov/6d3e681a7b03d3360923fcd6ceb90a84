Eskom says it has reached an agreement with residents of Dobsonville in Soweto who have been protesting after the power utility switched off their electricity. Residents of Mmesi Park had their power switched off last Friday after Eskom technicians, who had gone into the area to do an audit of the electricity meters, were chased out. Eskom says it discovered that about 80 percent of household meters in the area had been by-passed. Eskom’s Daphney Mokwena says, “When we did our desktop analysis on the payment history of the customers, we can pick up that 80% of them are not buying electricity, so that immediately required us to go and physically audit those meters.  The plan is to switch on the mini-subs. It’s about three mini-subs affecting about 250 customers, so we will be switching them on today.” The protest has since stopped and the situation is calm.
