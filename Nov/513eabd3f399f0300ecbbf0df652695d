Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha says nothing can stop the provincial government from placing the embattled Mogalakwena Municipality in Mokopane under administration. Mathabatha has compared the present situation in the municipality to 2015 when the previous Mogalakwena council sought a court interdict to stop the provincial government from placing it under administration. The municipality has been beset by infighting among African National Congress (ANC) councillors, allegations of maladministration and political killings. Mathabatha says they want to restore stability to the municipality. “Had we been allowed that time to impose Section 139(1)(b), we could have resolved the problem of Mogalakwena today. That’s why we ended up recalling 22 councillors. We are saying we’re going back to the same decision; we are going to impose section 139 so that the problems in Mogalakwena must be a thing of the past,” explains Mathabatha.
