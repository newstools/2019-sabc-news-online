Actor Patrick Shai intends to approach the police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), to report the conduct of SAPS officials, after they shot the actor multiple times with rubber bullets. Shai says police may have deliberately targeted him while he tried intervening between them and the enraged community of Dobsonville in Soweto. He was wounded after being shot by rubber bullets during a protest where the community was demanding the re-connection of electricity that was disconnected on Friday last week. Shai who has been discharged from hospital says he does not understand why he was shot. “Firstly, I got shot and there is evidence that I was not posing any threat… neither was I part of a struggle, but I was the voice of reason who was pleading – to say can there be calm, we don’t need another Marikana.” “One believes that our police force are agents of safety in our country and communities and are well trained to deal with situations such as these, what makes them use force when there is no threat at all?” asked Shai.
