The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union say the national carrier South African Airways (SAA) did not consult them about possible retrenchments. SAA says it is embarking on a restructuring process which may lead to job losses. The embattled airline has informed its 5 146 employees of the process. The airline has been facing several challenges, including high debt and fuel prices, high interest costs on loans and operating costs. Acting CEO Zuks Ramasia says the retrenchments could affect 944 employees. She says a consultation process has started with all employees in line with the Labour Relations Act. The restructuring excludes SAA subsidiaries, SAA Technical, Mango Airlines and Air Chefs. SATAWU spokesperson, Zanele Sabela says the law dictates that unions should be consulted if thereâ€™s to be retrenchment.
