The Black Business Council (BBC) has called on South Africans to support newly appointed Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter, saying the move will bring about change for the state-owned enterprise. The council made these comments after President Cyril Ramaphosa hailed the appointment of outgoing Nampak CEO, as the new Eskom Group CEO‚ saying the move will bring stability to the troubled power utility. BBC president Sandile Zungu says, “We are frustrated by the failure of Eskom to really punch at the weight where it truly belongs, and so we are saying it is all hands on deck. We accept what emerged with Andre. He needs to get our support as the Black Business Council and all of SA. It is not for Andre’s sake. It is for the sake of Eskom and for the sake of our economy and prosperity.” De Ruyter will take over from the January 15, 2020.
