The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein is to hear an appeal by liquidators of African Global Holding, formerly Bosasa, on Friday regarding the High Court decision in Johannesburg that reversed the liquidation of the company. In March the Johannesburg High Court set aside the decision taken by six directors of African Global Holding to voluntarily liquidate the company. The group of companies was placed into voluntary liquidation on 12 February. Bosasa changed its name to African Global Operations in 2017. Legal Expert Lebohang Mokhele says the directors may have erred in placing the company under liquidation.
