Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday  she was saddened by some people being wounded in anti-government protests at the weekend amid five months of sometimes violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled city. There have been many injuries in the protests, but no deaths. A 22-year-old student at a Hong Kong university who fell during protests at the weekend was in critical condition, hospital authorities said on Tuesday. A man knifed at least two people on Sunday  and bit off a part of a politician’s ear before being beaten by protesters. A 48-year-old suspect has been charged for wounding. Lam was speaking during a visit to Shanghai where Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated support for the Hong Kong chief executive. She said Xi had expressed his care and concern about Hong Kong.
