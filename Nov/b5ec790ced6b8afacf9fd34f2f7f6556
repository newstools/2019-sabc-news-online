The Department of Agriculture Spokesperson in Limpopo, Joshua Kwapa, says R3 million has been set aside to help farmers. Kwapa says the Department also intends to spend R9 million to drill boreholes at all affected areas. “The drought situation in the province is severe, and it is aggravated by the extreme high temperatures… our dam levels are currently at 49,9% compared to the same time last year which was at 63.7%. You can see the difference there that this year, the conditions are quite severe. We are aware there are communal farmers who are complaining that we have not reached them as the Department. We are calling on them to make contacts with our regional offices, in order for them to get help. We are not discriminating against any farmer,” says Kwapa.
