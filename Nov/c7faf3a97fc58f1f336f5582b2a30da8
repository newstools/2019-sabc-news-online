United States (US) President Donald Trump on Sunday said the name of the whistleblower whose concerns prompted an impeachment inquiry should be revealed because that individual had given false information. Trump, without giving evidence, suggested the whistle blower could potentially be guilty of fraud. “The whistleblower should be revealed because the whistle blower gave false information,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Trump also took the opportunity to lash out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He said she “has lost her mind” and that “her district is going to hell.” Trump’s comments came as the whistleblower offered to answer questions directly to Republicans on the intelligence committee leading the inquiry, one of his lawyers said on Sunday. Mark Zaid said the action was taken to counter Republican efforts, led by Trump, to unmask the whistleblower, a member of the US intelligence community whose identity has not been released.
