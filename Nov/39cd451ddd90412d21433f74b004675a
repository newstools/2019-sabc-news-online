Hundreds of Springbok fans have gathered in the Cape Town CBD where the team has embarked on the final leg of their World Cup trophy parade. The Boks are also visiting Parliament before taking the bus trip to areas like Elsies River, Belhar and Langa. A large group of supporters have also gathered at the Grand Parade where the World Champions will gather later. ANC Chief Whip in Parliament, Pemmy Majodina, says it’s an honour to receive team. “I attended the quarter semi and finals in Japan. This today is a culmination of building one nation, tolerance and one country.  We’re looking forward to this welcome of springboks in parliament because we’re one South Africa, and when we’re doing good things we must all support one another,” says Majodina.
