The Eastern Cape Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform has set aside R74 million to assist the farming community suffering the drought effects in the province. The Department says the relief is targeting subsistence and commercial emerging livestock farmers. Departmental spokesperson, Ayongezwa Lungisa says they have extended the time for the applications for farmers for drought relief to 22 November. Lungisa says the aid will bring much needed relief to struggling farmers that have been hard hit by the drought. “On the 18th of December, we would be able to respond to all the applications, in particular to give assistance to the farming communities of the Eastern Cape. Districts that will benefit the most are Amathole at around R27 million followed by Sarah Bartman and Chris Hani. The decision to put that money aside is on the basis of how much a district has been affected.” Farmers can approach their respective district offices for applications. Watch related video:
