The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it has appointed Councillor Abel Tau as the Acting Executive Mayor of the City of Tshwane. Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has taken special leave to allow the Federal Legal Commission to conclude its investigation into recent allegations against him.  This comes after a recording which has been dubbed ‘sex in the city’ surfaced at the weekend. The contents of the recording suggested that Mokgalapa and MMC for Transport, Sheila Senkubuge discussed colleagues and were allegedly intimate inside a municipal office. Tau has been serving as a member of the city’s Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Utilities since March 2019 as well as the DA Gauteng North Regional Chairperson since October 2017.
