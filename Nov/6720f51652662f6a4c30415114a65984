Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, says they have identified four possible suspects in the burning of 18 train carriages at Cape Town Station on Thursday morning. He says no arrests have yet been made. Mbalula was addressing the media following an inspection of the burnt out carriages. He says damage is estimated at R61-million.  Mbalula says 213 coaches have been gutted at a cost of more than R640 million over the last five years. Meanwhile, President of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Geoff Jacobs,  says business in the Cape Metro is suffering due to the failing rail infrastructure and the torching of trains. Jacobs was reacting to Thursday morning’s incident. He adds that something needs to be done about the situation. “The fires this morning are just another blow to workers who suffer daily trying to get to work using Metrorail trains, when and if trains do arrive they must sit if they are lucky or stand crushed like sardines in a tin; they arrive at work late often exhausted or unfit for the day’s work. Cape Town’s work force deserves better.” Watch video for more:
