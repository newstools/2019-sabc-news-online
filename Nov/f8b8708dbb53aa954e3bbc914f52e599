A pharmaceutical company, Cipla says the #FAFChallenge campaign aims to encourage men to self-test for testicular cancer. The Springbok’s Francois “Faf” de Klerk had tongues wagging when he met Britain’s Prince Harry in a patriotic speedo after their World Cup win. De Klerk is leading the campaign which is encouraging men to check for any irregular lumps, swelling or pain. It is one of the most common cancers in men between the ages of 15 and 49. However, if diagnosed in the early stages, the survival rate for testicular cancer is 99%. The company’s CEO Paul Miller says, “The Faf challenge campaign actually was an idea and a brain child of a Cipla employee; it was actually sparked when Faf met Prince Harry in a Speedo shortly after winning the Rugby World Cup. We just waited until the Springboks were done celebrating the trophy before we launched this campaign.”
