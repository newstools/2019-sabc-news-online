The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for the dismissal of the manager of the Emfuleni Municipality in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng. The party wants Human Settlements, Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Lebogang Maile to urgently place Oupa Nkoane on special leave until investigations of mismanagement against him are completed. The DA says Nkoane is among the 12 officials implicated in the 2017/18 forensic report which revealed the loss of R 872 million in unauthorized expenditure through a series of alleged irregular contracts in the municipality.
