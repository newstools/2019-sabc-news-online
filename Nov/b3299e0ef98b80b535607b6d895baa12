SRC president at Limpopo’s Capricorn TVET college, Robert Bopape, has called on the Higher Education department to prioritise TVET colleges the same way as the universities when it comes to the safety of students – especially young women. Bopape was speaking during the memorial service of the slain fellow student 21 year old Precious Ramabulana at Ramogopa campus.   A 28-year-old suspect has been arrested at Nyakelang village in Botlokwa in connection with the incident.   Bopape says the department must help to build accommodation facilities for students. “Stop taking universities seriously than TVET; we are more than fifty colleges in this country, we are more than universities, stop pumping more resources we need infrastructure. TVET colleges it is these same centres that will produce engineers, it is these same centres that will produce future artisans.”
