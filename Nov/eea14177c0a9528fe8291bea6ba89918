Springbok coach, Rassie Erasmus, says he hopes the team’s world cup success has a permanent positive effect on South Africa. Erasmus and most members of his squad, including Captain Siya Kolisi and the Web Ellis Trophy, arrived in Johannesburg on Tuesday. Supporters waited for hours on end to catch a glimpse of their favorite players, and, of course, the most famous trophy in world rugby. Captain Siya Kolisi made it clear that the Boks didn’t pursue the victory just for themselves, but for the entire South Africa. “We knew what was going on back at home and coach reminded us that we have a privilege of doing what we doing that can give hope to the people. It did drive us seeing all the videos in malls and in the taverns, and every single person just celebrating. So we know that it was much more than just for our personal gains, it was for the country.” Erasmus will now concentrate on his role as SA Rugby’s director of rugby as he wants to further develop and improve the sport across all spheres.
