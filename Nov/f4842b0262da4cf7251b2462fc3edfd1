Former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli has been acquitted on the four counts of intimidation that he was convicted of. This is as the result of the Constitutional Court ruling in October that sections of the Intimidation Act are unconstitutional. In July, Mdluli was found guilty on four counts of intimidation and two counts of kidnapping by the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. Mdluli, together with co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi have also been found guilty of two counts of common assault and two counts of assault grievous bodily harm (GBH). The case relates to the 1999 murder of Oupa Ramogibe, who allegedly had an affair with Mdluli’s customary wife – Tshidi Buthelezi. State prosecutor Zaais van Zyl called on the court to overturn the four charges of intimidation that Mdluli has been convicted of, to acquittals. Mdluli’s attorney, Ike Motlaung, also appealed to the court to acquit Mdluli on the four counts of intimidation, on the grounds that the highest court in the land has ruled that some parts of the Intimidation Act are unconstitutional. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng agreed with the submissions from both the state and the defence and acquitted Mdluli of all four charges of intimidation.
