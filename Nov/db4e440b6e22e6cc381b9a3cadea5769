South African Airways (SAA) says it is working to resume more flights within the continent, as aircrafts prepare to head to Accra, Lagos, Lusaka, Maputo, Windhoek and Harare on Tuesday. The airline wants to resume these routes after members affiliated to the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) and the National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) downed tools on Friday over a wage dispute and the restructuring of SAA – which could lead to more than 900 layoffs. SAA’s Chief Commercial Officer Philip Saunders says the suspension of domestic flights remains in place. Saunders says, “We have re-established all of our international flights. Today we are going to resume to destinations on the continent – that is Accra, Lagos, Lusaka, Maputo, Windhoek and Harare. We are committed to ramping up services day by day because SAA remains committed to our customers…” “We really urge our colleagues on site to think about the future of the airline and their jobs and come back to work,” adds Saunders.
