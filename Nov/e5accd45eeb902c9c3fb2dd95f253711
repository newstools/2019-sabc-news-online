About 150 crates of sardines were netted at the uShaka Beach by the Durban Seine Netters on Sunday morning. On Saturday there were unconfirmed reports that the silvery shoal were spotted in Durban and Umhlanga. Sardines usually travel toward colder sea temperatures in the winter, but they have now dashed across the Durban seas during warmer weather. Seine netter Goolam Essack explains how he spotted the sparkly shoal. “At 4 o clock this morning I got my crew together and went to Durban. So from the top we were watching the beach and we see shoals of sardines. I phoned the Durban Seine netters at the uShaka pier. They netted the fish. It was probably about 100, 150 crates and it was netted just after 6:15.  This is a main shoal of sardines coming from the south. Our runs only starting now.”
