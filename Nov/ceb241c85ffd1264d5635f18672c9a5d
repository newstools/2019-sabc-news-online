Scientists say the spread of HIV/AIDS needs the integration of resources. They have unpacked the challenges around HIV/AIDS at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The scientists say community engagement is also critical. Director at the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, Professor Salim Abdool-Karim, says awareness programmes must be intensified and circumcision encouraged. “If we simply wait for the treatment we will struggle even when people don’t know that they have HIV, by the time they know and even you provide regular testing, it is that short gap between the point which they were affected and their status. So get South Africa into a position where we can get really epidemic control is gonna be a long time now. So right now circumcision, condoms and education and upliftment of communities all those have to be part and parcel when we think about dealing with HIV/AIDS.”
