KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka says disaster relief teams will work around the clock to assist those affected by the tornado that has hit the Mpolweni area, near New Hanover in the province’s Midlands. Earlier on Tuesday, the South African Weather Service issued a warning that the area could experience a severe thunderstorm and strong winds. Hlomuka says the tornado has left a trail of destruction in its path and left community members shocked. “Our teams are working very hard to provide support to affected communities. We have put our emergency teams on standby, as we speak we are working with different stakeholders to assist our communities across the province, even at Graytown, we are aware and we are working on the matter. “  Hlomuka, says disaster management teams have been dispatched to the affected area. “We have released the staff from the disaster management team from the department and working with the municipality where the tornado wreaked through the area. It injured scores of people, damaging the houses and infrastructure. The report we have received so far indicated that there are a number of people who have sustained injuries and they are receiving medical attention.”
