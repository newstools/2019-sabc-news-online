KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, has warned that the thunderstorms forecast to hit the province is expected to be worse than the Easter floods which resulted in the death of dozens of people. Speaking during a media briefing in Durban, Hlomuka says schools are due to remain closed Thursday and Friday. He has urged people to be vigilant in flood-prone areas. He says the expected storm is likely to be coupled with gale-force winds, mudslides, hailstorms and localised flooding. “The intensity of this rain is anticipated to be greater than the one experienced in April. Schools and businesses  are urged to release learners and workers early.” “The weather service has indicated that Thursday and Friday will have heavy rain. We are also asking business leaders to release workers early and allow people to work from home rather than to report to the workplace. This is in the interest of the public’s safety,” adds Hlomuka.
