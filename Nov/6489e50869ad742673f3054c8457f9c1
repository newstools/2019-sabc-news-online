Veteran Broadcaster and Journalist Xolani Gwala has been laid to rest at his home at Impendle in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands this afternoon. The Special Provincial Official Funeral wrapped up with police escorting the casket to the hearse. The first part of the funeral started with family, friends, and colleagues paying tribute to him. Mourners described him as a hardworking and humble individual who was a fierce champion of the country’s democracy. Gwala died last week after succumbing to colon cancer. He had been battling the disease for two years. The wife of veteran broadcaster says his legendary stance as a talk show host and generous individual will forever be cemented in the history of South Africa. Peggy-Sue Khumalo’s letter to Gwala was read out at his funeral at his home town. Click video below:
