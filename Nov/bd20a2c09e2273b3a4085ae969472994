Luyanda Botha, the man accused of raping and murdering UCT student, Uyinene Mrwetyana has been sentenced to three life terms in the High Court in Cape Town. Botha got an additional five years for defeating the ends of justice which will run concurrently. He will not be eligible for parole for 25 years. Botha pleaded guilty to two charges of rape, one of murder and one of defeating the ends of justice. He agreed to a plea and sentence agreement in court on Friday morning. Botha confessed to killing 19-year-old Mrwetyana in August this year and pointed out the crime scene to the police. He allegedly lured her to the Clareinch Post Office in Claremont after hours. Mrwetyana’s charred body was found in a shallow grave in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats a week after she had gone missing.
