United States ambassador to South Africa Lana Marks says America will continue to assist the country with significant donations towards HIV/AIDS programmes. African aid from the US came into doubt after President Donald Trump threatened to cut it. Earlier this year during the AIDS conference in Durban delegates raised concerns about HIV/AIDS funding no longer being available at the necessary amounts. Marks said, “As long as we continue getting results and accountability the aid will continue and I believe it will increase. The congress is very motivated too and President Trump is very much motivated too.” “SA is the anchor for the whole of Africa and example for the whole of Africa so we in USA feel SA is tremendously important,” added Marks. South Africa remains the leading country with the highest number of people living with the disease.    Amazing to meet these fantastic, dynamic, and strong ladies — all DREAMS ambassadors — whom I met today at the Umlazi U21 Clinic in KZN!
