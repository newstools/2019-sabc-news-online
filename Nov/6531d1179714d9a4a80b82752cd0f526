Former head of South Africa’s Secret Service, Mo Shaik says former President Jacob Zuma could not separate his relationship with the Guptas from his responsibilities as head of state. Shaik was testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, for a second consecutive day. He worked at the State Security Agency from 2009 to 2011 when he was forced to resign due to a breakdown in the relationship with the then State Security Minister, Siyabonga Cwele. “Yes, it would’ve explained the close personal relationship that he had which maybe justifiable and understandable, but he was not applying his mind to the national security issue that information was paddled, which implicates his office and needed to be investigated objectively.” For more, watch the video below:
