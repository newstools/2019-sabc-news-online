The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has expressed sadness over the passing of Social Development MEC, Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe. Khawe died at Mulbarton Hospital in Alberton on Friday night. Prior to her appointment as MEC after this year’s general elections, she was a long-serving member and chairperson of the Social Development Portfolio Committee in the Gauteng Legislature. DA Gauteng Caucus Leader, Solly Msimanga says South Africa has lost a patriot. “Really as South Africans, we have lost a great and patriotic South African; an MEC that was very dedicated towards ensuring that all the people are served. She will dearly be missed and we would like to pass our condolences to all affected,” says Msimanga.
