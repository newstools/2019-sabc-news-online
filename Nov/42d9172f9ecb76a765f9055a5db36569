The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) provincial leader in the North West Joe McGluwa has penned an open letter to Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi over his messages on social media following the Springboks victory at the Rugby World Cup. Following the victory Ndlozi took to Twitter with statements such as “Congratulations to #SiyaKolisi, the rest go get your congratulations from Prince Harry” he also stated “we are pushing against all efforts to pull a 1994/1996 on us again.” McGluwa says Ndlozi’s “persistent rage against the positive sentiments shows he’s out of touch with majority of the population.” He also hinted that the unity that is bringing the country together is something Ndlozi fears as it threatens his political existence. McGluwa ends the letter with “All the best as you continue to desperately justify your politics of hate.” Ndlozi has not yet commented on the letter or its contents.
