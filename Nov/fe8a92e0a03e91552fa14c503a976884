Two people have died after being electrocuted while tampering with City Power infrastructure in two separate incidents in Johannesburg. In the first incident a man was killed, and his colleague seriously injured while trying to paint a City Power High Voltage Chamber located inside a factory in Heriotdale on Monday. In another incident, the body of a man was discovered between electric wires in a veld in Roodepoort.  It’s believed he had been electrocuted by illegal power connections in the area. City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena: “In both cases we’ve notified the police they are investigating, and as City Power, we will be giving them the necessary support they will need in their investigations.”
