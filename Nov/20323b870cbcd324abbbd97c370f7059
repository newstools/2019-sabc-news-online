South African Airways (SAA) has confirmed that the  Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) mediation with striking unions will begin on Saturday morning. Workers from National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) and the SA Cabin Crew Association began a nationwide strike on Friday over a wage dispute and looming retrenchments. SAA has extended the cancellation of all domestic and regional flights but says it hopes to resume international flights from Sunday. The SAA call centre hours have been extended until midnight to accommodate passengers wanting to rebook flights or receive a refund. SAA spokesperson, Tlali Tlali say says all affected passengers by the extended cancellation will be rescheduled on Mango and SA Airlink flights where possible. “All our ticketed passengers who are due to travel on Sunday and Monday to destinations in South Africa and to the rest of the African continent who are affected by flight cancellations, on those days they will be accommodated on Mango airlines and SA Airlink respectively. ” Day one of the strike has paralysed operations at airports across the country. The protest action over wages has affected passengers and flights since early morning. Aviation experts in Tanzania say the cancellation could affect tourism and airport revenues.
