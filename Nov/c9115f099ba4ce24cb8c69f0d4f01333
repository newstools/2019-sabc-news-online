Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says police are still searching for four people suspected to have been involved in torching two trains at the Cape Town station on Thursday. Eighteen coaches were gutted in the blaze. The estimated damage to the two trains stands at R61 million. Signalling cables worth R150 000 were also damaged. Speaking to the media following the fire, Mbalula said police were making efforts to apprehend the suspects. “We have always said that there is a criminal hand rendering this place unworkable and ungovernable that has always been the modus operandi. Whether this is linked to security companies and these are their activities and whether it is the motive we can’t vividly say.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
