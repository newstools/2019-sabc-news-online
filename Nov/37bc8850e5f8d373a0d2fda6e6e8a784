Authorities in Zimbabwe say at least 80 elephants have died in the country over the past two months. Hundreds more have died in neighbouring Botswana and Zambia. Scientists believe that climate change is one of the reasons why they are perishing. The authorities in Botswana are struggling to find alternate sources of water for the animals. In Zimbabwe, officials are trying to locate boreholes in order to draw out water for the animals. Area Manager at Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management says: “In the past three months, we have recorded more than 80 elephants which have died, and these deaths are attributed to the effects of climate change as a result a shortage of water and food. As management, we’ve managed to do our own intervention to try and augment water through the natural water plants which are around the park.”  Watch the video below for more:
