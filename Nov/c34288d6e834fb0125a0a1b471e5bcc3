Eskom is appealing to South Africans and businesses to use electricity sparingly as the electricity system is severely constrained and will remain so until Thursday. However, no loadshedding is expected at this stage. Last month, the power utility implemented loadshedding due to urgent maintenance. Eskom concedes that the system remains vulnerable due to historic factors such as inadequate maintenance, as well as the ageing of plants. The power utility says it will keep South Africans informed about the status of the electricity system and its recovery efforts. Watch related video:
