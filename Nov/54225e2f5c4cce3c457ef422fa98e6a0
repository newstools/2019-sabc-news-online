South African born British politician, Lord Peter Hain, has advised that law enforcement agencies should set time frames to root out widespread corruption across the country. Hain, a former anti-apartheid activist, has been at the helm of having international companies investigated by governments amid State Capture allegations. Speaking at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg, Hain says unraveling corruption allegations and the recouping of funds should not be limited to the Gupta family. “I think there is some urgency in establishing these new bodies. We don’t know if this is continuing at the moment and all the focus has been on the Gupta brothers and former president [Jacob] Zuma but the problem is continuing amongst others. There may be a tendency to say we will deal with the Gupta problem and then we have dealt with the whole thing when it is the largest iceberg in a lake of many icebergs of corrupt practise. So I think there is a lot of urgency in this and that is why I have suggested those time frames.” Hain has recommended that what he calls a “senior managers regime” be introduced that would see senior managers taking full responsibility for wrong-doing at companies across South Africa. He’s told the commission that this would help minimize fraud and money laundering in both the public and private sectors. He adds that those involved in money laundering must be punished.
