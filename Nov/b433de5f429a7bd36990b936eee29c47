More than 180 refugees, who invaded the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Pretoria last week, are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court. This is after about 500 refugees, including women with children, forced entry into the premises of the offices in Brooklyn, East of Pretoria. The High Court in Pretoria ordered that they vacate the premises following an application by the local residents. The refugees want to be relocated to other countries out of fear of xenophobic attacks. Most women and children have been sent to the Lindela Repatriation Centre for identification. The police’s Brigadier Mathapelo Peters explains. “The 182 men and one woman are expected to appear before the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court on charges of trespassing. Lawlessness will never be tolerated by SAPS, not under any circumstances. There are systems and processes in place, which must be followed by anyone who wishes to raise a grievance. Those who are found to be undermining the law and authority of state will be arrested and will face the full might of the law.” Watch the videos below for more on the story:
