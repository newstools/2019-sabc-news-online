The Inkatha Freedom Party’s (IFP) Women’s Brigade in Gauteng will hold its Provincial Elective Conference at the Boksburg Civic Centre in Ekurhuleni on Saturday. The conference will be attended by members of the IFP’s National Executive Committee led by National Treasurer General, Narend Singh. National Chairperson of the party’s Women’s Brigade, Phumzile Buthelezi, will deliver the keynote address. IFP Gauteng Secretary, Alco Ngobese, says the leadership that will emerge will be part of the party’s Provincial Executive Committee. “We had a Women’s Brigade many years ago, recently we never had the Women’s Brigade in the province but this is a step towards the right direction for the IFP. Last month we elected the PEC of Gauteng but the work is not completed until we have the women component of it, the Women’s Brigade. So we’re fulfilling that constitutional mandate to elect our Women Brigade,” says Ngobese.
