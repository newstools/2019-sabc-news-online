Parliamentâ€˜s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has given the South African Airways (SAA) board until next Tuesday to submit all required documents and financial statements. The committee also says it will request Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to intervene in the matter. The SAA board sent a last-minute apology for a committee meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday night. Scopa had given the SAA board until Wednesday to establish a clear plan on the company finances and to determine when it will be able to present its financial statements to the committee. The embattled airline has not submitted its financial statements for the past two years.
