The Life Esidimeni saga will be the first case to be adjudicated by the Special Investigation Unit Special Tribunal before the end of this year. The special tribunal headed by Judge Gidfonia Makhanya has started serving summons to 13 Non-Governmental Organisations which allegedly made fraudulent claims against the Gauteng Health Department. The claims amount to R5.5 million.  Hundred and forty mentally ill patients died when they were moved from Life Esidimeni to various non-profit organisations a few years ago. The special tribunal’s spokesperson, Selby Makgotho says the defendants are being served with summonses. “We are ready to commence with the proceedings. The first batch of cases which we have received relate to the Life Esidimeni arbitration. The plaintiffs are the Special Investigative Unit and the Department of Health in Gauteng against the 13 defendants who we will not be able to mention at this stage since they still have to receive the summons.  These non-profit organisations have been found to have exorbitant fraudulent claims to the Department of Health.”
