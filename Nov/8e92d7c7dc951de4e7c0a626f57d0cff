Police Minister Bheki Cele will on Friday launch the Western Cape’s safety plan for the festive season in Phillipi in Cape Town. He recently told the SABC that the bulk of new police recruits will be deployed in the province to boost crime fighting. The plan will be launched under the theme “Zojika Izinto- Turning the tide against crime”. Rising crime levels in the Western Cape have led to the deployment of the army to help the police to fight gangsterism. Cele will be accompanied by the national police commissioner Khehla Sithole and the provincial safety MEC Albert Fritz to the launch in Phillipi.
