The Buffalo City Municipality in the Eastern Cape is evicting people who illegally occupied RDP houses at Fynbos in East London. They began the evictions on Monday and the process is expected to be concluded on Wednesday. In June, the municipality tried to evict occupants but it was unsuccessful as people moved in overnight. Buffalo City Municipality spokesperson, Samkelo Ngwenya says this time they will make sure that the evictions are concluded. “This time around we are with law enforcement agencies and we are also putting in the due beneficiaries onto the houses as soon as we evict those that have been occupying the houses illegally. We’ve provided trucks for those that are being evicted so that we can store their furniture.  We know that the issue of housing is a very sensitive issue however we cannot tolerate the issue of illegal invasion of homes.”
