The leaders of the all five BRICS nations have arrived for the final day of deliberations at their annual summit in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. Among the topics the five will discuss throughout the day will include the theme for the summit “Economic growth through innovation under various sub-sections that include transnational crime, health, promoting trade and investment with a focus on infrastructure development and private-public partnerships”. Dialogue has also been blocked off with the BRICS Business Council and the New Development Bank where we understand a pipeline of possible new deals will be presented to the leaders. This will be followed by a working lunch after which the group will break off into bilateral meetings. President Cyril  Ramaphosa is expected to meet privately with the leaders of Brazil, China and India. A joint-communique on the summit’s outcomes are also expected to be issued later. Organizers appear to be hamstrung with poor organisation and a lack of capacity to deal with the hundreds of journalists who have arrived to cover the event.
