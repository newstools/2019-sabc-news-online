The Democratic Alliance (DA) will elect its interim leader when the party’s Federal Council sits at the weekend. The party says the council has only one item on the agenda – the election of the Interim Federal leader and interim Federal chairperson to lead the party until the Federal Congress in 2020. The race for the interim leader position is now between two candidates, Parliamentary leader John Steenhuizen and member of the Gauteng Legislature Makashule Gana. This after Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela pulled out of the race last week. Candidates for the interim Federal chairperson are; Ivan Meyer, Khume Ramulifho and Nomafrench Mbombo. The Federal Council is the party’s highest decision-making body between congresses.
