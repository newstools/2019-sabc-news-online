The Democratic Alliance (DA) will be going to an early Federal Congress in May 2020 where the party’s highest decision making body will elect a new leadership. On Sunday a special sitting of the party’s Federal Council elected John Steenhuisen as its interim leader and Ivan Meyer as interim Federal Chairperson. The two positions became vacant following Mmusi Maimane and Athol Trollip’s unexpected resignations, three days after Helen Zille was elected party’s Federal Council Chair in October. Meyer made the announcement during a media briefing in Johannesburg shortly after their election. “What is now critically important is to have the policy conference – and in terms of our time line, in April 2020 and in May 2020 the Federal executive has approved a time line to have a federal congress to elect permanent leaders.” The DA has been leaderless for almost a month following Maimane’s resignation. Steenhuisen will also lead the party into its first policy conference which is set to take place before the early congress.  Click video below:
