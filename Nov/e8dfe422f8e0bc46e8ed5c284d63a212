The pre-trial conference of the man accused of raping and murdering UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana is on Friday expected to get underway in the High Court in Cape Town. Luyanda Botha confessed to killing the 19-year-old in August and pointed out the crime scene to the police. He’s also been charged with rape, defeating the administration of justice and assault. Mrwetyana had gone to the Claremont Post Office on the 24th of August. It’s alleged Botha lured her back to the venue after hours. Her charred body was found in a shallow grave in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats a week after she had gone missing.
