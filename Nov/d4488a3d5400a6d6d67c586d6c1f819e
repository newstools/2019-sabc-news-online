The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is pleased to announce that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) has dismissed complaints received from the public, regarding the SABC’s broadcast of an interview with the convicted rapist Nicholas Ninow’s mother, Chantelle Ninow. The interview was aired on the 27th of October 2019.

The BCCSA cited that the basis of these complaints were that the “broadcast of an interview with the mother of a convicted child rapist amounts to the glamorisation of violence and the advocacy of hatred based on race and gender”.

The public service broadcaster welcomes the BCCSA’s ruling and views it as an affirmation of SABC News’s commitment to uphold its editorial policy, and the BCCSA Code of Conduct, in delivering news and current affairs in an independent and impartial manner.
