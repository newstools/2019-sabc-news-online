The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) has confirmed that Vicki Momberg, who was convicted of crimen injuria for using the K word, had filed a notice to appeal her conviction and sentence in the Supreme Court of Appeal. However, a warrant for her arrest remains valid because she filed her notice late and also failed to apply for an extension of her bail.  She had until the end of July to do so. The former real estate agent was sentenced to an effective two years in jail for using the K-word at least 48 times against a black police officer in 2016. Gauteng police say they’ve been looking for her since August. Gauteng NPA Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says, “Momberg filed a notice to appeal with the supreme court of appeal on the 12th of August, coupled with a condonation for late filing of a notice to appeal, which was filed the next day on the 13th of August 2019.” “The NPA has since filed the responding heads of arguments on the 11 September 2019. However, this process does not cancel the warrant of arrest as there was no application for the extension of bail made by Momberg.” Related video click below:
