The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature Makashule Gana says the party cannot continue to avoid the issue of racial redress. Gana made these comments after DA’s Douglas Gibson said white people in the party are tired of talking about race. He says, “I believe the DA needs a new direction, the DA needs to start focusing itself on issues of justice, especially economic justice , social justice and environmental justice. This is a space that I believe is left open in South African politics.” Gana is in the running for the position of interim party leader and said the DA risks losing its legitimacy if it ignores this matter.
