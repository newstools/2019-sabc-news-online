Railway Agency Prasa has frozen former executive Daniel Mthimkhulu’s pension after he faked his qualifications. Mthimkhulu’s also been ordered to pay back R5.7 million by the High Court in Johannesburg for misleading the organisation about his qualifications. He had reached senior management level by claiming that he had a national diploma, a B-tech degree and a PhD when he only had a matric certificate. His fake qualifications came to the fore after it emerged that the agency had taken delivery of trains at a cost of R3.5 billion that were not suitable for the metrorail lines. Prasa chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama says the legal people are pursuing the matter. She says: “We have often been asked what are the chances of recovering that but we would like to assure the public that when Mthimkhulu left Prasa his pension was frozen because by that time the issue of misconduct and criminality had already come up and we have verified that.”
