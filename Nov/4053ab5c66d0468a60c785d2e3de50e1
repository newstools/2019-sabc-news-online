The South African Rooibos Industry has signed an agreement with the San and Khoi councils in Yzerfontein on the West Coast, recognising them as the traditional knowledge holders to the uses of Rooibos tea. The agreement follows nine years of negotiations. It will allow the first people to access the benefits as a percentage contribution from the industryâ€™s commercial sales of Rooibos. Rooibos is an indigenous plant species found only in the Cederberg. The agreement will be implemented for a year after which it will be reviewed based on information gathered from the first 12 months.
