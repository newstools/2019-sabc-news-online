The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to grant AmaXhosa King Zwelonke Sigcawu an official Category 1 funeral. The President will also deliver the eulogy at the funeral which will take place on Friday, next week.  King Sigcawu died more than a week ago at the age of 51 in Mthatha hospital in the Eastern Cape. Another memorial service in his honour is expected to be held in Khayelitsha on Saturday at 14H00.  UDM Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa says traditional leaders and the role they played have not often been acknowledged while politicians are always granted state funerals. “This decision goes a long way towards correcting the mistake that has happened in the past where politicians seem not to appreciate and recognise the important role that traditional leaders play in our society. But it also goes a long way in appreciating and acknowledging the role that other stakeholders and other leaders play in our society. But also what delights us greatly about this step, it seeks to correct a mistake that we have been making as politicians where not enough recognition and appreciation has been given to the monumental role and contribution of traditional leaders to our struggle for freedom. So we welcome this very important decision.”
