The KwaZulu-Natal provincial executive council has confirmed that the death toll from the heavy rains sits at fourteen since October. In a statement, the council says 798 houses were affected across the province. This is the first time an official death toll has been released. Meanwhile, the Weather Service has issued a warning of severe showers and thundershowers in parts of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and the Eastern Cape Wednesday evening.  At least two people died in KZN following the tornado that ripped through the midlands. However, no warning has been issued for Gauteng, where a 60-percent chance of showers and thundershowers is expected Wednesday night  and Thursday. Weather Forecaster, Tokelo Chiloane,”The warning is for the eastern parts of KZN and the north-eastern parts of Eastern Cape. We have a watch for severe thunderstorms in that region for tonight and we also have a warning for heavy rainfall leading to localised flooding over the south-western parts of the Eastern Cape tonight.”   News just in, four people are lucky to be alive after the taxi they were travelling in was swept off Barnsley Road into the swollen Duzi river in the Camps Drift area of Pietermaritzburg Wednesday afternoon. Flash flooding from the heavy rain in the area meant the normally calm stream had burst over the top of the bridge, taking the taxi with it. Luckily a series of concrete bollards caught the vehicle before it dropped further over into the deeper water. All four were treated on scene for minor cuts and abrasions – the lady who had been in the water the longest was found to be suffering from mild hypothermia. -ER 24
