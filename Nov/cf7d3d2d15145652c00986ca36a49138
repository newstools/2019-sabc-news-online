Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says local government has a constitutional duty to be financially responsible and accountable. Minister Mboweni was answering a question in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on financial mismanagement by municipalities. Mboweni said the legal framework for financial control at local level begins with the executive mayors, municipal councillors and municipal managers. “The legal framework is the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, which provides that accountability with the financial responsibility of municipalities on service delivery includes its finances, (and it) rests with the municipal councils. Its responsibility is discharged with the mayor, the municipal councillors and municipal manager, who is appointed as the head of administration.”
