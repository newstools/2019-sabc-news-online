Police have recovered two firearms and explosives following the fatal shooting of one of the most wanted suspected serial murderers in Durban Deep, south of Johannesburg. Another suspect was wounded and the third one arrested. The deceased is believed to have been behind some incidents of rape, armed robberies, murders, and other serious and violent crimes in Matholesville, Durban-Deep, Braamfischerville, Roodepoort and surrounding areas. “In dealing decisively with illicit mining, an integrated intelligence-driven operation led the police to a hostel at Durban Deep where police were to apprehend a suspect wanted in connection with multiple murders. On arrival at the scene, it is alleged that a shootout ensued between the suspects and the police, and one suspect was fatally wounded. Police recovered on the scene two unlicensed firearms with ammunition. Further investigations led police to another room where police seized explosives and four firearm holsters,” says Police Spokesperson, Mmathapelo Peters.
