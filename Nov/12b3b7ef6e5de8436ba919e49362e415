The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape says it welcomes Energy and Mineral Resources minister, Gwede Mantashe’s decision to agree to the province’s request to explore options for sourcing energy directly from Independent Power Producers. DA Member of the Provincial Parliament, Deidre Baartman, says the decision was taken after she wrote to Mantashe earlier in 2019, requesting him to release the Western Cape from its energy dependency on Eskom, which could free the province from load shedding. She says the DA will continue to work to ensure energy security and sustainability in the Western Cape. “We need to reduce our reliance on coal as our primary source of power and improve our carbon emissions control. It is for this reason that we need to urgently engage in a new bid window for IPPs, more specifically, renewable IPPs in order to ensure a more diverse, clean, competitive and efficient energy sector.” The DA in the Western Cape says remains committed to ensuring energy security and sustainability in the province. ” We will continue to lobby national government to green light the necessary processes in order to make the process possible for our residents, and protect our provincial economy from the scourge of load shedding.”  Related video click below:
