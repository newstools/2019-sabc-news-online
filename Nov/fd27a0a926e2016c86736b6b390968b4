South African Airways (SAA) says it will reinstate its international flights that were cancelled this weekend, along with domestic and regional flights following a nationwide strike. The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) are expected to brief the media in Johannesburg on Sunday. The unions failed to make much progress with SAA at the CCMA as the airline’s management wants another union, the National Transport Movement (NTM) to join the wage talks. SAA members who belong to the unions have embarked on a strike which started on Friday. They are demanding an 8% wage increase while SAA is offering 5.9%, depending on the availability of funds. The strike has led to the cancellation of flights since Friday. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali explains the changes in their flight operations. “For Sunday and for Monday for domestic, the flights that are SAA operated remain cancelled; however, as of Sunday evening, we will reinstate the international service – that means we’ll start operating flights from Johannesburg to various international destinations, and from Monday, we’ll then start operating from those international stations back to Johannesburg.”  Click video below for more:
