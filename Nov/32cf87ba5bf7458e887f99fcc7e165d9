The search for a missing teenager has been temporarily suspended at Rocklands Beach in Sea Point in Cape Town due to rough seas. Two bodies were recovered on Monday night those of a 16-year-old male and a 15-year-old girl. The other body was found at sea on Sunday. The four foreign teenagers got into difficulty in the water after they were swept out to sea by a wave at the weekend. Family members and onlookers have gathered on the Sea Point Promenade. Rescue crews say they will have to wait for the water to subside before continuing with diving efforts.
