Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane confirmed that she received a redacted version of the SARS Rogue report which was compiled by Inspector-General of Intelligence, Setlhomamaru Dintwe. It was reported that the Public Protector had received the report from State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. A report compiled by Mkhwebane found that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan violated the Executive Ethics Code and acted unconstitutionally when he established the investigative unit when he was SARS commissioner. Mkhwebane’s spokesperson Oupa Sekgalwe says, “This follows a settlement reached in terms of Rule 43 of the Uniform rules of court wherein the Minister offered the Public Protector a redacted version of the report in question.” “Minister Dlodlo had previously gone to court to have the report removed from the court record, after one of the parties in the review proceedings of advocate Mkhwebane’s SARS rogue unit report was from the EFF annexed it to its papers. Mkhwebane opposed this action and filed an affidavit in support of the EFF’s counter application to Minister Dlodlo’s court bid,” added Sekgalwe.
