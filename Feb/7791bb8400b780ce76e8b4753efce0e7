The United National Transport Union (UNTU) representing some workers at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa has penned a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa pleading with him to intervene at  Prasa. UNTU says Prasa is in ruins and in need of serious intervention. Last month, three people died and hundreds were injured when a train crashed into a stationary train on the same railway line at the Mountain View station in Pretoria. Spokesperson for Untu, Sonja
Carstens, says there’s no stability at Prasa. “Everyone at Prasa is acting; so there is no stability on a senior management level. They’ve submitted today five turnaround strategies to Parliament. If you just think about it, if they’ve implemented the first one, then maybe we didn’t have a need for a second one. But every time they change the leadership structure of Prasa then you need someone new coming in; and they need to draw up another turnaround strategy, none of them being implemented,” says Carstens.
