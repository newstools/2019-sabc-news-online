Former Correctional Services commissioner Linda Mti has been granted R20 000 bail. Mti appeared briefly in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Thursday. He handed himself over to the police in the afternoon at the Pretoria Central police station. He is facing charges of Contravening the Public Finance Management Act. Mti was supposed to have appeared alongside former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi  and his other four co-accused in court on Wednesday. They are facing corruption charges, related to tenders being awarded to Bosasa by the Department of Correctional Services. The brief appearance by Mti saw him in the dock for a few minutes before the matter was remanded to the 27th of next month. He flew from Port Elizabeth to present himself to law authorities. The state indicated it had no reason to deny the accused bail. His passport has been handed over to the investigating officer. Mti has a previous conviction for driving under the influence which he paid a R20 000 fine.
