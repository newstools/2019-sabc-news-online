Soweto highway and several other roads in and around Diepkloof in Soweto have been blocked off to traffic due to an ongoing community protest in the area. Traffic has been heavily affected. It still not clear at this stage what the protest is about. Johannesburg Metro Police Department has advised motorists to use alternative routes. Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says, “There is a protest in Diepkloof, Soweto this morning (Friday) and it is over a wide area which includes Ben Naude drive, Soweto highway as well as Imming drive. Motorists are advised to drive with caution because there are rocks and burning tyres on those roads. However, Chris Hani drive is flowing smoothly so motorists can use Chris Hani drive as an alternate route.”
