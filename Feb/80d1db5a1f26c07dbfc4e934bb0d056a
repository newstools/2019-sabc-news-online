The number of women taking up chemistry as a career is on the increase in South Africa. This is according to the senior lecturer in the School of Chemistry at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), Brenda Moodley. Speaking at the Global Women in Chemistry breakfast, Moodley says she has seen an increased number of South African women taking an interest in studying chemistry over the years. “I’ve definitely seen an increase in young women taking up science as a career. Teaching for so many years, I have noticed many young women going into chemistry. They seem to enjoy a career in chemistry, a lot of them are graduating, even when Professor Mathonsi put up the slide showing the Honours students in chemistry – you can see that the females have increased over the years. In fact, last year we only had two males in a class of about 25 and the rest were females. Female chemists are increasing as the years are going by,” says Moodley. Watch a related video below:
