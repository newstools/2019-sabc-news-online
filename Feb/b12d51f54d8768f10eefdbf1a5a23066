President Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, businessman Atiku Abubakar, cast their ballots in Nigeria’s presidential election on Saturday as voting began after a week’s delay in Africa’s biggest economic power. Analysts say the vote is too close to call, with the outcome set to hinge on which man voters most trust to revamp an economy still struggling to recover from a 2016 recession. Buhari, a former military ruler who was later elected president, is seeking a second term in charge of Africa’s most populous nation and top crude producer. Atiku, a former vice-president, has pledged to expand the role of the private sector. The two candidates lead a field of more than 70 challengers. Reuters witnesses observed some delays to the opening of polling stations and problems with voting systems in the early part of the ballot. Last Saturday, the election was postponed around five hours before polling stations were due to open by electoral commission, which cited logistical factors. Buhari, who voted in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina, said, “I will congratulate myself, I am going to be the winner” when asked by reporters if he would congratulate his rival, should Atiku win the election. Atiku later cast his ballot in the eastern Adamawa state.
