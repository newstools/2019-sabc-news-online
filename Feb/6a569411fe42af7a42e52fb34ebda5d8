Students have started class boycotts over National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) allowances and other issues at the University of Venda and the Sol Plaatje University amongst others. At the University of Venda in Limpopo students are demanding the cancellations of all outstanding debts and those students be issued with their certificates of qualifications. Student Representative Council (SRC)
president Tsundzuka Hakamela says they will not return to classes until their
demands are met. “We are intending not to have any class until our issue is resolved, our issue is that students when they graduate, they must get their certificates because we can’t address the issue of young people getting jobs while the University is holding their certificates, because of an outstanding balance and historic debts.” Meanwhile, classes at Sol Plaatje University, in Kimberley have been suspended after student’s shutdown the campus on Thursday. Angry students have been singing and
protesting outside the institution demanding their issues to be addressed. The university’s Student Representative Council’s (SRC) spokesperson, Itumeleng Senye says, “The SRC has requested a shutdown until all the issues that we raised to management can be addressed. Classes are suspended until our issues can be addressed. The issues that we’re having are the financial exclusions, academic exclusions, residential issues of last week that we were talking about. There’s favouritism in terms of which student gets accommodation and which ones doesn’t get accommodation and we believe that the system is biased.”
