Various organisations and residents in Soweto, Johannesburg have pleaded with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) not to grant Eskom its requested electricity tariff hike. NERSA is holding hearings across the country on what the R420-billion debt-heavy power utility should charge to recover its shortfalls. Meanwhile, residents are protesting outside the Soweto Theatre, demanding that NERSA reject Eskom’s tariff increase request. Residents say the price of electricity is already too high. “We are pleading with them about the electricity; his 15% that they are proposing will make things much worse.” NERSA will continue its hearings in Midrand on Monday.
