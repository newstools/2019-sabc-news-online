National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) deputy head Willie Hofmeyr will again take the stand at the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria on Friday morning. His cross examination was postponed on Tuesday following gruelling cross-examination from both advocate Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi’s legal teams earlier this week. This after Hofmeyr gave damning testimony against Jiba and Mrwebi. He made allegations of political interference and lack of action against corruption cases under Jiba and Mrwebi’s watch. However, Hofmeyr’s credibility as a witness was questioned multiple times. This after the role Hofmeyr played in the NPA’s controversial decision to drop corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma in April 2009.
