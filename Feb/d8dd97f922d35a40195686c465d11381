Motorists in Mpumalanga have been warned to avoid using the R38 road between Badplaas and Mbombela as the bridge on that road is overflowing. According to the Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety and Security Liaison, only one lane is open to motorists. Motorists have been urged to use the R541 to Machadodorp. The Department Spokesperson Moeti Mmusi says road officials are monitoring the situation. “One side of the road is currently being used. It is strongly advisable that they should avoid using the bridge because we don’t know, as the day progresses, how worse it would get, although the law enforcement agencies as well as Sanral are on the site to redirect motorists accordingly. But the situation would be closely monitored by the law enforcement agencies.”
