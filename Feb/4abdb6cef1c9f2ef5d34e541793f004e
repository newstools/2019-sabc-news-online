Two vehicles have been set alight on the Westville and Howard campuses at the University of KwaZulu-Natali in Durban. This follows violent protests at the university earlier on Monday which resulted in the suspension of the institution’s academic program. UKZN SRC member Khumzi Khumalo has condemned the damage to property, however, he says they will continue with their protest until their demands are met. “We have been engaging with the university since last year there have been a lot of engagements with the university where we even proposed that we take the matter to council we called a special council to resolve these matters is but the university does not listen to us they only listen to one language which is a mass demonstration which is what we have been giving to them today,” says Khumalo.
