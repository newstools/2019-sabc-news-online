Legendary maskandi musician Zibokwakhe ‘Phuzekhemisi’ Mnyandu has appeared briefly before the Durban Magistrate’s Court. He is charged with the attempted murder of one of his band members. The incident happened in December 2018. It’s believed Mnyandu had an argument with two band members. During a scuffle, a 35-year-old man was shot and later died. In court, the state requested a postponement because post-mortem results are still outstanding. Pending the results, the state may change the charge to murder. Mnyandu’s bail was then extended and the case was postponed to the 26th of March. Watch related video below for more on the story:
