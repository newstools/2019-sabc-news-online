ANC Chairperson, Gwede Mantashe, says he’s determined to clear his name when he appears before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. He has shown his Eastern Cape properties to the media following the testimony of an employee of Bosasa, which is now trading as African Global Group, Richard Le Roux, to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that a team of technicians worked on a special project to install security upgrades at three of Mantashe’s properties. Le Roux said the installation cost R300 000. While it’s reported that eight cameras at each of Mantashe’s Eastern Cape properties have been installed, but there are neither electric fences nor alarm systems as was reported. Mantashe says cameras at his home still have serial numbers. Le Roux said they removed serial numbers so that nothing could be traced back to Bosasa. Mantashe says he’ll give the commission his side of the story. “Le Roux who comes as an after effect, after Agrizzi has given evidence for nine days and not mentioning me for nine days. The trend in discussions in the media is to put us all in one pot, but what should happen and that should happen in the commission, every individual must go to the commission explain himself or herself, clear his name, own up for what happened and that is what I’m going to do.” On Saturday, Mantashe led the media on a tour of his home in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg.
