The legal team of suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi has told the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria that General Johan Booysen can still be charged with racketeering if new evidence could be obtained. This is despite his testimony that the decision to suspend and prosecute him was irrational. Booysen is the former head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal. He has told the enquiry that Jiba fabricated racketeering charges against him linked to his tenure as head of the Cato Manor Organized Crime Unit, known as the “death squad”. The enquiry is probing Jiba and Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office. Jiba’s lawyer Norman Arendse argued that it was premature for Booysen to appear before the enquiry. Meanwhile, a senior police officer attached to the Anti-Corruption Task Team, Kobus Roelofse will on Tuesday conclude his testimony before the enquiry. Last week Roelofse testified that he was removed from the Richard Mduli fraud case and charged with misconduct in an attempt to derail the investigations. On Monday, former head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal, Johan Booysen argued that the decision to suspend and prosecute him by Jiba was irrational. The Asset Forfeiture Unit’s Willie Hofmeyr is also expected to conclude his testimony. Last week, Hofmeyr gave incriminating testimony against Jiba and Mrwebi. He told the enquiry that Jiba took the decision to prosecute Booysen for racketeering.  He claims that she was also responsible for the arrest of former prosecutor, Gerrie Nel to prevent him from prosecuting the late former National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi.
