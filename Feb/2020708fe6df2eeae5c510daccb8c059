Three suspected hijackers have been killed during a shoot-out with police in Kaalfontein near Tembisa east of Johannesburg. It is believed that the three suspects were on their way to commit a robbery on Monday when police intercepted them.  One civilian was injured and taken to hospital after her vehicle and that of the suspected robbers collided in an attempt to get away. The suspects’ vehicle is reported to have been stolen from Kempton Park last week. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says: “Police recovered an R5 rifle as well as a nine mm pistol that the suspects used in the shooting. There is a possibility that there could be more weapons or firearms that could have been used during the planned armed robbery.”
