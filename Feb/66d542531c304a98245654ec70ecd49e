 The Mokgoro enquiry investigating into the fitness to hold office of Senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi has adjourned until Friday. This as the marathon testimony by NPA deputy head Willie
Hofmeyr continues. Hofmeyr has been on the witness stand for four days. He faced gruelling cross examination from both Jiba and Mrwebi’s legal teams. The cross examination comes after Hofmeyr gave damning
testimony against Jiba and Mrwebi. Hofmeyr made allegations of political interference and lack
of action against corruption cases under Jiba and Mrwebi’s watch. However Hofmeyr’s credibility as a witness was questioned
multiple times. This was because of the role Hofmeyer played in the NPA’s
controversial decision to drop corruption charges against former President Zuma
back in 2009. He was part of the NPA team that made the decision but has told
the Mokgoro Enquiry that he regrets that decision. Hofmeyr is expected back on the witness stand on Friday. Watch related videos below for more on the story:
