girl. Thobakgale’s also accused of swindling money from people through pyramid
schemes. He is said to have ordered the beating of congregants who
don’t pay tithes. The matter has been referred to the National Director of
Public Prosecution for directives National Prosecuting Authority Spokesperson Mashudu
Malabi-Dzhangi says, “This matter has been postponed for the reason that it
must be referred to the NDPP to give some directives and there are five accused.
Accused number one is for the rape case of the minor so that is why the NDPP
should give directives”
