Congress of the People (COPE) National Spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, has described as “havoc” the situation at the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) around 2004 when he was the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee in Parliament. He told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg that there was not much accountability from Correctional Services, including a delay in giving the Portfolio Committee information on progress in the department. Bloem names former Minister of Correctional Services, Ngconde Balfour and former DCS National Commissioner, Vernie Petersen as the leaders during the “havoc”. He says the committee also had problems during the leadership of Linda Mti and Tom Moyane. “This thing of Bosasa was hampering the functions of the Department of Correctional Services. There was no control, there was no responsibility in the department. To mention chair, I had a good working relationship with POPCRU and they themselves were unhappy,” says Bloem.
