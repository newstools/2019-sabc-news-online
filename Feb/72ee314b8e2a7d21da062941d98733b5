The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume its hearings on Monday. The commission will hear testimony from former ANC MP,
Vytjie Mentor. Mentor will complete her evidence and will be cross-examined
by those granted leave to cross examine her. Commission spokesperson, Reverend Mbuyisela Stimela says they are scheduled to start at 10. “You will recall that Miss Lakela Kaunda was granted leave to cross-examine Miss Vytjie Mentor and also advocate Mtolo and Major General [Zinhle] Mnonopi. So those are the three people who are going to cross-examine Miss Mentor.” Click below to watch Mentor’s testimony
