Outgoing Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga is expected to formally vacate his office on Monday. He resigned last month to pursue his Gauteng premier candidacy for the DA ahead of the May 8th elections. The Tshwane Council is expected to elect a new mayor on Tuesday. Msimanga has faced his fair share of controversy over issues ranging from complaints about poor service delivery, allegations of prioritising affluent suburbs over struggling townships and employing unqualified staff at his offices. However, he says he’s leaving his post
with a clean conscious, knowing that he served the people of Tshwane with
diligence. “I can subject myself to a lifestyle audit if one should be called… We have said let there be an investigation and then from that investigation, we will see what steps need to be taken.” Click on video below:
