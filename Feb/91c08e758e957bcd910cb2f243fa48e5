The Human Rights Commission has confirmed that it is investigating the prolonged water shortages in the troubled Masilonyana Municipality in the Free State. For over a decade, residents of Brandfort, Theunissen, Verkeerdevlei and Winburg have had to grapple with the problem of dry taps. The Human Rights Commission previously investigated the matter following the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) request. A damning report on the municipality was released a few years ago but it seems little has changed. Free State Human Rights Commission Manager, Thabang Kheswa, says urgent measures need to be taken to resolve the problem. “It’s a very serious issue – water is a very serious constitutional right and life really becomes difficult without water and it would seem the water challenges in Brandfort and neighbouring places date way long back,” says Kheswa.
