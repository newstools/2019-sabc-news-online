Fire-fighters have managed to extinguish the blaze at Holy Cross Primary School, and started with damping down operations as the Cape Town heat continues to persist. About 600 learners at the school near District Six had a narrow escape when a fire broke out at the school on Thursday. The cause is yet to be determined. At least 30 fire-fighters battled the blaze in extreme heat. There have been no reports of injuries. Emotional scenes played out at the School as tearful pupils watched on as part of their school become engulfed in flames. Several classrooms have
been  gutted including a library which
was still in the construction stages. Divisional Commander for
Fire and Rescue Services, Simon Abrahams, says they managed to save parts of
the building and houses adjacent to the school. Circuit manager for the Holy
Cross Primary School Junaid Daries says they now need to assess the extent of
the damage before a decision can be made before teaching and learning can take
place. “We are plus, minus 600 leaners and the affected classrooms at this stage are only four, and so we need to assess that because I know parents are anxious. Do I send my kids to school? but I have learned the teachers have chat groups and they obviously need to communicate their information to parents.” Click on video below:
