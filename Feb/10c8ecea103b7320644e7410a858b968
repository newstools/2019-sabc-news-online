A 36-year-old Cape Town man has laid a counter charge of assault against police after he was allegedly beaten up for asking them not to speed in the Nyanga East residential area. Luthando Frans appeared briefly in the Fezeka Community court in Gugulethu on charges of crimen injuria, assault and intimidation. The case has been postponed to the 21st February for further investigation. Frans says he was arrested on Wednesday after admonishing police not to drive fast in the area. He says he was escorting his children to school when the altercation happened. “They tell me I cannot tell them how to drive. I’m not even a traffic cop and they know what they are doing, then I said okay to them. Sorry!  Then the other police asked me what I’m going to do, he is going to give me a show off now. I said for what, then he drove the car and chase me, he came straight to me, get out of the car and clap me and take me down, they kick me all over, then I screamed and tell them my arm is broken they never stopped beating,” says Frans.
