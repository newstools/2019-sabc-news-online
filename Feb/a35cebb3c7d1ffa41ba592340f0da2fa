 Police Minister Bheki Cele has addressed the funeral service of special task force member Erasmus Musa at the Maveshe sports ground outside Port Shepstone on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Police officers and members of the task force earlier formed
a guard of honour when Musaâ€™s casket arrived at the venue. Musa is being buried with full police honours. The officer and a member of the crime intelligence unit,
Carl Van Der Vyver, died in a shootout with cash in transit robbers outside
Nongoma last week. Seven robbers were killed during the incident and three others escaped.
