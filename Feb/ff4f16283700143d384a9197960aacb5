The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) says it held a constructive meeting with The Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams following an incident covered by the SABC where the minister was recorded blocking journalists from covering the ANC manifesto launch at Badibanise Stadium in KwaBhaca, formerly Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. The manifesto launch was disrupted by protesters who were frustrated with the lack of service delivery in the area when Ndabeni-Abrahams tried to block the SABC journalists from covering the protest. SANEF says that its delegation emphasised to the minister that her actions undermined media freedom and the minister took full responsibility for her actions, apologising unreservedly. “She expressed her commitment to championing the sanctity of media independence, protected by the country’s Constitution,” SANEF said in a statement. Ndabeni-Abrahams has confirmed that she will be meeting with the SABC management to discuss the incident. She also called for government and SANEF to work closely in curbing the reporting of fake news and to protect journalists against intimidation. SANEF says it has discussed with Ndabeni-Abrahams the recent incidences of cyber-bullying; where social media is used as a weapon to discredit, threaten and silence journalists. “SANEF welcomes the sentiment expressed by the minister and her promise for greater activism for media freedom and democracy,” the forum said. Both SANEF and Ndabeni-Abrahams have committed to working together towards the substantive transformation of the industry. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
