A fourth learner has died after a bridge collapsed at HoÃ«rskool Driehoek in Vanderbiljpark on Friday. He has been identified as 16-year-old Marnus Nagel. He was one of 23 learners hospitalised after a walkway at the school collapsed. Gauteng MEC of Education Panyazi Lesufi confirmed in a tweet that another child died.  Lesufi assured the community of Vanderbiljpark that they could continue to count on him and on the department during this time of need. In another tweet, he urged the community not to take heed of those trying to use race or politics to inflict further pain, saying that true South Africans were standing behind them.
