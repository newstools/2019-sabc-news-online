Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu says his party will pull all the stops to ensure that challenges faced by students at tertiary institutions are addressed. Shivambu engaged students from different tertiary institutions at a mass meeting held at the University of Mpumalanga in Mbombela. The students raised concerns about a lack of proper accommodation, challenges in registration and protests that lead to disruption of academic activities. The EFF leadership says 2018â€™s protests were not in the interests of students. It claims there were external forces fueling the unrest.
