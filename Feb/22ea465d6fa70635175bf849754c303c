The ANC Veterans League has requested the Office of the President to accord its late deputy president, Bonisile Norushe, an official funeral. The movement says it has approached the office of the Eastern Cape premier in this regard. The 71-year old Norushe died at the St Dominics hospital in East London after a lengthy illness. A former trade unionist, Umkonto Wesizwe militant and a disciplined ANC stalwart, Norushe was known for upholding the integrity and the dignity of the ANC. The ANC Veteran’s League President Snuki Zikalala described his passing as a great loss to the movement. “Before I would raise issues in those important structures, I would consult with him. He would say: ‘Snuki this is the way we should take issues with.’ Of course he was concerned with the list that was submitted for the national conference because some of the people have their names tainted. He would say: ‘Snuki we cannot allow people to go to Parliament with that bad interpretation that they are involved in so called alleged corruption.”
