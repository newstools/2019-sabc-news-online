Cosatu in Limpopo is confident that the intervention of the Police Minister will speed up the arrest of criminals who shot and killed two senior officials of the South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) in the province. Samwu deputy provincial secretary, Ronald Mani, and the trade union’s former provincial chairperson, Timson Musetsho, died this week after being shot in two separate incidents. The two were in the forefront fighting for the suspension and arrest of municipal officials involved in the VBS Mutual Bank saga. Cosatu’s provincial leadership is meeting with Minister of Police Bheki Cele in Sibasa outside Thohoyandou on Saturday to end instability in the Vhembe district municipality. Provincial secretary Gerald Thwala explains, “As we are speaking there are no arrests. This one needs the Minister of Police to come so that we can talk about our concerns. We continue to be worried up until today, there are no arrests and the killers are still roaming the streets of Vhembe and Limpopo, we don’t know who is next. The safety and security of our leaders are a priority.”
