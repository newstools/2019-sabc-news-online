Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi has joined other SADC countries in calling for an end to sanctions on Zimbabwe. Masisi was speaking Wednesday night in Harare where he is on a one day visit. The two leaders will co-chair the Bi-National Commission on Thursday.  The aim is to strengthen relations between Harare and Gabarone. With a sinking economy and high fuel tariffs, President Emmerson Mnangagwa is under pressure to rebuild the economy. Botswana says the lifting of sanctions will help Zimbabwe grow its economy. It also commended Mnangagwa for creating space for political dialogue. Mokgweetsi Masisi, President of Botswana, says that they are encouraged by the reform agenda. “We are encouraged by the reform agenda you have embark on and the political dialog because it will lead to the economic recovery.” Meanwhile, the office of the president of Botswana has dismissed reports that Botswana will give Zimbabwe a credit line worth $600 million. President Mnangagwa will host his counterpart from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in March. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
