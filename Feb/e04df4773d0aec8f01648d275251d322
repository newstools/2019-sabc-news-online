Young people from across the country gathered in Pretoria to discuss how to make the right choices. The You Only Live Once (YOLO) Programme serves as a reminder to the youth to own their choices. This includes their right to say no to any involvement in social ills such as substance abuse, crime and sexual interaction. Social Development Deputy Minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu says the programme will help young people to make positive changes in their communities. “The department runs the programme called YOLO. The intention is for us to create a movement of responsible young people who are able to contribute positively not only to their country, but also to their household; to their communities; to their villages; to their schools. So, we remind young people that they have one life and they have one chance at it and how we can work together with them to make it a better chance of living.”
