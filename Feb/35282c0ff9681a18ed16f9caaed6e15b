The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has called on the Department of Social Development to insource services that were contracted to embattled African Global Operations company, formerly Bosasa. The company has announced it will go into voluntary liquidation as a result of banks closing their accounts. It has a number of contracts with the department to run youth centres and facilities that houses awaiting trial minors. African Global Operations has been in the spotlight following damning bribery allegations involving government officials emerging out of the State of Capture Inquiry. The liquidation could lead to massive job losses. Nehawu spokesperson Khaya Xaba says, “We appeal to the department to ensure that those workers are insourced as early as 28 February. We don’t want our workers to panic or to worry about job security.” “If the insourcing doesn’t happen, our next step would be to mobilise for a strike of all these workers from Bosasa and social development in order to send a message to the Minister [Susan Shabangu] that we can’t continue to have core functions of government being outsourced to private service providers,” adds Xaba.
