Civil society movement Freedom Under Law has blamed former president Jacob Zuma and then head of the NDPP Shaun Abrahams for worsening the damage to the NPA office. This emerged during the testimony of Max du Plesis of Freedom Under Law at the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria. Du Plesis testified that Zuma and Abrahams ignored several court decisions citing the unfitness to hold of office against suspended senior NPA advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. The two are being probed for their fitness to hold office following allegations of mishandling of high profile corruption cases. Du Plesis says  Jiba and Mrwebi were being protected despite various court decisions condemning their action. Du Plesis has also criticised Abrahams’ decision to withdraw fraud and perjury charges against Jiba. Watch a related video below:
