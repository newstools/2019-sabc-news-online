The controversial Nigerian pastor of the Jesus Dominion International Church, Timothy Omotoso, will be in the Port Elizabeth High Court again on Monday with two co-accused, facing more than 90 sex-related charges. Proceedings might come to a halt as the defence team have petitioned the Constitutional Court to have the judge in the matter recused. They say judge Mandela Makaula is biased. In the last court appearance, Omotoso’s legal team lost their petition to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein to have presiding Judge Mandela Makaula recuse himself. It dismissed the application on the grounds that there’s no prospect of success in the application. The defence wanted Makaula to recuse himself and charges against their clients quashed, claiming undue bias. They have since petitioned the Constitutional Court, the highest court in the land, to take action. Defence lawyer, Peter Daubermann, previously indicated his clients are uncomfortable, blaming Judge Makaula of being biased and sympathetic towards the first witness, Cheryl Zondi. They feel they’ve been treated unfairly. Daubermann said the two co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho were assaulted, intimated and prevented from attending court by Cheryl Zondi’s supporters. Dauberman said if the intimidation continued, he would bring a motion of irregularity, as it would be seen as an unfair trial. Several witnesses are yet to take to the stand. Civil society and several gender activist groups are expected to picket outside court. The Jesus Dominion International Church members are also expected to continue supporting Timothy Omotoso.
