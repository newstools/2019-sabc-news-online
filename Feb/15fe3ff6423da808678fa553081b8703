The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has launched its first business current affairs programme which is set to air weekly on DStv channel 404. The programme, called Economics Unbound, will air its first episode on Thursday, 14 February 2018 at 21:30 and will be hosted the SABC News Economics Editor, Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki and a widget called Nana.  The SABC said in a statement that the programme seeks to rise above the market noise that obscures the understanding of the economy, by including ordinary South Africans in well-informed and purposeful conversations about the South African economy. The programme also seeks to equip South Africans with information that will help them make better economic and financial decisions. “Audiences can look forward to 30 minutes of deep and tough questioning on the issues of the week, including interviews with key decision makers and experts,” reads the statement. SABC News Group Executive, Phathiswa Magopeni says that the programme is one of the attempts by the public broadcaster to ensure quality and credible news to both local and international audiences. ”The programme is one of the many endeavours by the public news service to ensure quality and credible news content to its local and international audiences. SABC News continues to redefine its programming to ensure greater reach and relevance to its audiences, and Economics Unbound is one of the many shows that seek to break down complex issues and make them comprehensible to the South African public, in line with our mandate.”
