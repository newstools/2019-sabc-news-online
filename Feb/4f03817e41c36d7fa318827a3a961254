New laws on foreign investment in the UK will block Chinese firm 
Huawei from sensitive UK tech projects, The Sun newspaper reported on 
Friday. Many are concerned that allowing Huawei an inside track 
on the rollout of the 5G mobile network in the UK would let China spy on
 private lives and hack UK companies, The Sun said. Foreign 
Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson are among 
those concerned about the Chinese firmâ€™s reach, the report said.
