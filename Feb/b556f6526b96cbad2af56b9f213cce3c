A group of more than 40 land claimants, who have been sitting inside the offices of the Department of  Rural Development and Land Reform in Polokwane for four days, have finally left the building. They claim the Department ignored a land claim they submitted between 1996 and 1998. By Sunday about 40 of the 100 land claimants were still waiting inside the offices of the department. Finally they got to see the minister. After the meeting they were given ownership documents and promised municipal services. It all started in 1998 when 4000 people submitted their land claims. Some were paid out but R7,2 million allegedly disappeared and files were allegedly lost when the department moved to another building. Six years ago, 500 people started living on a 42 hectare piece of land, which they did not own legally and which is not serviced by the Polokwane municipality. But they say they also claimed a further 170 hectares next to it, which is now up for sale for R53 million. Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane promises to look for the documents. The claimants also have to provide their copies. They will meet again in three weeks’ time. The area is called Jansen Park, but the claimants want to call their piece of it after one of their leaders, S. E. Mogano.
