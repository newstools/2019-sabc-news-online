Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police says it will deliberate on the letter Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride sent to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete. In the letter, McBride objects to Police Minister Bheki Cele‘s decision not to renew his contract when it expires at the end of February. McBride has also taken the matter
to court to request it to force Cele to explain why his contract will not be
renewed. Committee Chairperson Francois
Beukman says they will look into this matter and make recommendations to
Parliament. “From our perspective, we have evaluated the referral of the speaker on Friday and in terms of the rules I have directed the committee staff to put that matter on the agenda of the committee. On Tuesday, we will process the matter in terms of the relevant rules and then come with recommendations to the house after that process.” Click below for more on the story:
