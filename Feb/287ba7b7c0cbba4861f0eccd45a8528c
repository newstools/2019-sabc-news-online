Zimbabweâ€™s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has reassigned four military officers to join the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The most noticeable move is that of General Anselem Sanyatwe, who was in charge when the army responded to the violent unrest after elections in August in 2018. Six people were killed and 35 others wounded when protesters clashed with soldiers. Sanyatwe and the three other officers were also part of the 2017 military intervention that resulted in the ousting of former President Robert Mugabe from office.
