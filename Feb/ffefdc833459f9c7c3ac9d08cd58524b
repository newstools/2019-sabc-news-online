Judgement in the trial of Elvis Ramosebudi, the man accused of plotting to assassinate politicians and prominent South Africans, is expected to be handed down in the Johannesburg Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. The state argues that he sent letters to businesses asking for funding for a coup. In one of the letters dated 25 October 2016‚ Ramosebudi details the so-called assassination plot‚ with targets including the then president Jacob Zuma‚ his son Duduzane and 17 other high-ranking politicians and prominent South Africans. Under the heading Let’s Help Save South Africa‚ the letter reads: “It is now in our hands as the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance to request financial assistance and support for the amount of R60 million in order to finance our undercover coup plot mission to assassinate Jacob Zuma and his entire state capture regime.” During the trial, the court heard that that former state security minister David Mahlobo‚ former Free State premier Ace Magashule and former mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane were the first three people Ramosebudi allegedly wanted to assassinate.
