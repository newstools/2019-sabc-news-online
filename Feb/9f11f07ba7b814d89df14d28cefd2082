Nicholas Ninow dubbed the ‘Dros Rapist’ has been declared fit to stand trial. The Pretoria Magistrates Court heard on Friday that three psychiatrists and one psychologist found that Ninow does not suffer from any mental illness that will prevent him from standing trial. Ninow’s trial will be heard in the high court of Pretoria later this year. The case was remanded until March for the docket to be disclosed to the defence. Ninow remains in custody. He is charged with raping a 7 year old girl at a Dros restaurant in Pretoria, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and possession of drugs.
