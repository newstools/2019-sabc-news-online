A senior police officer attached to the Anti-Corruption Task Team, Kobus Roelofse, will conclude his testimony before the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria on Tuesday morning. On Monday, the enquiry heard how a sting operation was set to expose police officers who were on a mission to discredit the former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head, Johan Booysen. Booysen argued that Adcovate Nomgcobo Jiba’s decision to suspend and prosecute him was irrational. He was at the time probing KwaZulu-Natal businessman, Toshen Panday, about multi-million rand tender irregularities. He is the 13th witness to appear before the Mokgoro Enquiry. Last week, Roelofse testified that he was removed from the fraud case of former crime intelligence head, Richard Mdluli and charged with misconduct in an attempt to derail the investigations. The Asset Forfeiture Unit’s Willie Hofmeyer is also expected to conclude his testimony. Hofmeyer has told the enquiry, amongst other things, that Jiba was the one who decided to prosecute Booysen for racketeering. He claimed that she was also responsible for the arrest of former prosecutor, Gerrie Nel, to prevent him from prosecuting the late former National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi. The enquiry is probing the fitness to hold office of suspended NPA senior advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. Watch a related video below:
