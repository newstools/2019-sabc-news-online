Some learners could find themselves
without teachers in their classrooms on Wednesday. The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) says its members will join the national strike called by labour federation Cosatu. The strike is against job losses and
the high unemployment rate in the country. Sadtu which is an affiliate of Cosatu
says when parents of learners are retrenched it has a direct impact on the
learners and their ability to study. Sadtu’s Nkosana Dolopi says, “What we usually do is to inform all the parents on time that we will be on strike, so that the parents can then make a decision in terms of the question of the safety of their children.” “Now I can only talk about the teachers. The teachers will be on strike, the teachers will be joining all other workers, all members of Cosatu on Wednesday.”
