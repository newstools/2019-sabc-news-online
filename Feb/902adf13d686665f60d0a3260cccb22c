(POCA), committed from 2015, in relation to Exchange Control Regulations related to foreign currency in an amount of 1 147 200 USD. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the arrest follows an investigation that was launched last year. “It was a matter that was brought to our attention in 2018 that was last year. We worked with different people and different organisations. Issues of money laundering that were picked up and it was given to a task team. We can confirm that they are in custody and they will appear on Monday at the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court. In most of these cases when you talks about issues of money laundering we try by all means to oppose bail so it will be the court’s decision.” The couple who run several business enterprises in South Africa and abroad are expected to appear before the Pretoria Commercial Crime Court on Monday. ECG Spokesperson Maynard Manyowa has also confirmed the arrest. “This (Friday) morning, around 07:00 in the morning armed members of the police stormed Sparkling Waters Hotel in Rustenburg, South Africa. We were later made aware that they were members of the Directorate for Priority Investigations (Hawks). They took the Prophet and our mother Prophetess Mary Bushiri in handcuffs to Pretoria.” Manyowa says the Hawks charged Bushiri with fraud and money laundering. “As you will remember, from last year, we have struggled with reports that our father was guilty.” He is currently being held at a Pretoria police station. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/650620">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
