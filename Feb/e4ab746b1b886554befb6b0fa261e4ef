The African National Congress (ANC) says it can’t confirm whether charges of sexual harassment against its spokesperson, Pule Mabe, have been dropped. The party’s acting national spokesperson, Dakota Lekgoete, was responding to media reports that a panel consisting of members of the ANC’s National Executive Committee has cleared Mabe of the charges. He says the party’s structures have not yet received the panel’s report. Mabe took special leave after his former personal assistant accused him of sexual harassment. Lekgoete says, “I can confirm now that the report related to the grievance hearing of comrade Pule Mabe has not come officially to our structures. What we see in the media and social media I think it’s a leaked process, but the matter is not yet final from the side of the ANC. For now we can’t comment until the report is formally tabled and properly processed.” Watch related video below:
