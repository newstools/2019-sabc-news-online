Four people have died and eleven others have been injured after a minibus taxi overturned on the N1 north, near the Grasmere toll plaza, south of Johannesburg. Itâ€™s understood that the driver of the taxi lost control after a tyre burst. Paramedics arrived to find several passengers ejected from the vehicle when it rolled multiple times. Three women and a 13-year-old boy sustained numerous injuries and were declared dead. Joburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says Metro police officers are on scene and there has been no obstruction to traffic.
