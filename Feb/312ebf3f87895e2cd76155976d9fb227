A ‘screen-grabbed’ Facebook post currently circulating on social media platforms is falsely representing SABC News and spreading misinformation. This post, which contains SABC News branding, makes claims concerning Prophet Shepherd Bushiri. These claims are unverified and were not published by SABC News. The ‘screen grab’ that is circulating is a doctored image. The public is advised to exercise caution should they come across it.
