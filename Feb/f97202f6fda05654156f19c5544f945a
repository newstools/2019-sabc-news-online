Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe says the prospects of oil could change the South African economy. He visited the Total Oil Exploration Drill, about 180km offshore from Mossel Bay. “Oil will be a game changer, gas will add a lot of value and we are hoping that we discover oil and a lot of it so that we can reduce our dependency on imported crude oil for our survival. This is one of the most important projects underway now. We will give total all the support we can.” The world could have a new source of fuel, off the Southern Cape coast of South Africa. The Deep-sea Stavanger has been drilling the ocean floor for the past two months. Located in the Southern Outeniqua deep water basin, the Brulpadda field could deliver billions of barrels of oil.
