A 55-year-old teacher who allegedly sexually assaulted children at  a primary school in Valhalla in Pretoria will remain in custody until his next court appearance on Wednesday. The man is facing seven counts of sexual assault after he allegedly inappropriately touched 23 girls between the ages of 10 and 12. The children made the allegations against him after the Tshwane metro police hosted a workshop about safety, abuse and violence at the school last month. The teacher handed himself over to police on Thursday. Gauteng Education spokesperson, Steve Mabona, has commended metro police for conducting the workshop at the school. “It looks like they are progressive. We’d really encourage them to continue to do that. We are actually indebted to them because if it wasn’t for them, probably we wouldn’t have known that that incident happened,” explains Mabona. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane says the postponement of the case  was  prompted by the state completing its work. “The Valhalla teacher who is charged with seven counts of sexual assault appeared [at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court] and the matter has been postponed to allow the state to complete profiling the accused person such as the confirmation of address or whether he has previous convictions or not,” adds Louw-Mjonondwane.
