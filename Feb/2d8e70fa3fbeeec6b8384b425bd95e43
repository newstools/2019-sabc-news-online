The Durban University of Technology (DUT) has once again suspended the academic programme on its five Durban campuses following student protests on Monday. On Monday students handed over a memorandum to university management demanding the arrest of the suspect involved in the killing of Mlungisi Madonsela. Students marched to the university calling for free education and justice for the Madonsela family after the student was shot and killed in a scuffle between students and security guards outside campus two weeks ago. The campus in Pietermaritzburg is not affected. Vice-chancellor Thandwa Mthembu, has said in a statement that they are suspending the academic programme for the sake of the safety of staff. The university also condemned what it called threats allegedly made by some SRC members. The DUT SRC is saying they will only resume classes after the studentsâ€™ demands have been met. The demands also include unblocking the students who have outstanding debts from last year. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
