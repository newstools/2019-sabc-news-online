Angelo Agrizzi, the former COO of Bosasa, who recently made waves at the State Capture Inquiry, came under fire from Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF) leader Julius Malema as he delivered his keynote address at the launch of the party’s election manifesto at Giant Stadium in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria on Saturday. Earlier this week, Agrizzi admitted to the Zondo Commission that he’s a racist. Malema says Agrizzi should continue giving names of all corrupt officials. “Agrizzi is a fat cat, he’s not our friend but being a racist it doesn’t mean we must not listen to him. Agrizzi you bloody racist.” Watch video below:
