Incredible Happenings leader Paseka Motsoeneng, also known as Pastor Mboro, together with officials from the South African Funeral Practitioners Association (SAFPA) will on Thursday confront controversial Pastor Alph Lukau of the Alleluia Ministries International. This is over the so-called resurrection video showing a man allegedly being brought back to life by Pastor Lukau. In a statement, Motsoeneng dismisses this as just an antic performed to get media attention and fame. He lashed out at Pastor Lukau saying he has brought Christianity into disrepute. Mboro says Lukau must account for his actions. “Pastor Lukau must actually explain himself to me and the church because I am a prophet in this country and I cannot allow people being fooled in the name of God. He needs to come clean, apologise and be converted by accepting Christ. He cost that funeral parlour money, he damaged their reputation, this is not the role of the church,” says pastor Mboro. SAFPA Chairperson Thabo Banda also condemned the incident. “What we intend doing is to clarify certain issues with regard to the way Pastor Lukau acted or behaved. As you would realise, the funeral industry finds itself involved with this whole thing as a result of one of our own members transporting the body to the church. So as an industry, we really condemn what has happened in very strong terms.” Related Video
