Parliament’s Police Committee will start with its draft report on the fate of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head, Robert McBride, on Wednesday. The committee has set aside this week, in terms of a court order of the Gauteng High Court that the committee must discuss whether they agree with the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele that McBride’s contract should not be renewed. The chairperson of the committee, Francois Beukman, says they are awaiting outstanding documents from McBride before compiling the draft report. “There is the issue of security clearance and then his applications he made for the two posts as head of DPCI and PSIRA and then also the report of the public service commission, to get his comments on that,” says Beukman.
