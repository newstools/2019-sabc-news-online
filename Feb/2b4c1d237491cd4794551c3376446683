African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson Gwede Mantashe will lead the media on a tour of his two properties in the Eastern Cape on Sunday to show them the security upgrades at the properties. Earlier on Saturday, Mantashe led the media on a tour of his home in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg. This followed Bosasa employee Richard le Roux’s testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that a team of technicians who worked on special projects installed security upgrades on three of Mantashe’s properties amounting to R300 000. He has dismissed the allegations and says he will appear
before the Commission to clear his name. “Your Agrizzi testified for nine days. It was not by accident. It was the reality that I never interacted with them. I’m not on the payroll of Bosasa. I was never on its payroll, never in my life and that’s why Agrizzi could not mention my name for nine days.”
