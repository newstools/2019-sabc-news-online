Justice Minister Michael Masutha says Department of Correctional Services employees – who have been implicated in acts of impropriety at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture – must provide reasons why they should not be suspended. This after the department undertook in-loco inspections of kitchens at a number of correctional centres where African Global Operations, formerly Bosasa supplied kitchen services. Masutha was speaking during a media briefing in Pretoria on Monday after former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi implicated the company in tender rigging at the Correctional Services Department. Masutha says the Department has given African Global Operations, 30 days to terminate the nutrition contract. “Without prejudice, officials who are still employed in the DCS, and who were implicated in acts of impropriety in the testimonies given at the Zondo Commission, have been served with noticed in accordance with rules of natural justice to show why they should not be placed under precautionary suspension. Following these developments, DCS management developed and implemented a business continuity plan to ensure that the provision of nutritional services is not disrupted.”
