 Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head, Robert McBride will hear before the end of this month whether the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Police will renew his contract. McBride’s contract
expires on the 28th of February and Police Minister, Bheki Cele, earlier
indicated he will not recommend to the committee that McBride’s contract be
renewed. According to the court order, the committee must inform the court by 22 February on its progress. McBride says the court case is about ensuring IPID
independence from political interference. “The issue is not about my employment position that is a constitutional matter, it’s about ensuring the independence of IPID and that their independence is not tramples upon. I don’t have any entitlement to any job but I do have entitlement to proper processes and so too, to the people of South Africa,” says McBride. Watch related video below for more on the story:
