Inventor of Vodacom’s Please Call Me, Nkosana Makate, says he is close to victory.  Speaking to the SABC, Makate says he will be challenging Vodacom’s offer in court through a judicial review after talks between the two parties reached a deadlock.  According to reports Vodacom had offered Makate over R40 million for his invention, but the Please Call Me campaign says the inventor is entitled to R70 billion. “We still need to decide whether we will go to the Constitutional Court directly or we’re going to the High Court. I’m already closer to victory. I’ve ran. I’ve always said I ran 100 km race. I’m still on 95 and I’m not accepting anything that I consider ridiculous and flawed and unacceptable.”
