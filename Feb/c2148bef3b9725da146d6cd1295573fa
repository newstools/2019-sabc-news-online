Student representatives say classes have been cancelled at Wits University’s main Campus in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, due to student protests. Vehicles are not being allowed to enter the university.  Privates security officers have formed a wall across the university entrances. A group of students, some covering their faces have blocked some of the roads inside the university with rocks. Students have been protesting since Monday. They are demanding that the university provide students with accommodation. They are also demanding that students with historical debt be allowed to register. Wits SRC member Solomzi Moleketi says: “The students have not been violent at all, they have been singing peacefully. This unreasonable amount of security is not necessarry. Wits has aggravated the students by using private security to chase them around campus.” Wits has not been available for comment. For the latest on the situation at the university watch below
