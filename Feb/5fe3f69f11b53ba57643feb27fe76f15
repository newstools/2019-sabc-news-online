The family of three children who suffocated inside an unused refrigerator in Bonke village, outside King William’s Town in the Eastern Cape, is battling to cope with the death of their children. It’s alleged that Esihle, Emihle and Hlalumi Nkatshase were playing inside the house without supervision when they got into an unused freezer and locked themselves in it. The children were aged
three, four and seven years. They were found by their grandmother following a
search. The mother of one of the
children, Daphney Nkatshase, says it is difficult to come to terms with her
loss. “I still cannot believe it. I’m numb. I can see that people are busy with funeral preparations and there’s nothing I can change now. My child was active and now his silence is louder.” Police have confirmed that an inquest docket has been opened. Police spokesperson Siphokazi Mawisa says “A case on inquest was opened by Zwelitsha police on Friday, 1st February 2019, following the bodies of three kids that were found in an unused freezer at Bonke Location. The docket that was opened and registered will be taken to the senior prosecutor at Zwelitsha Magistrates Court for decision.”
