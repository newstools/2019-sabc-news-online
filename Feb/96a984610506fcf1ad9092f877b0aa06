Corruption Watch says declaring former board members of Eskom delinquent would touch them where it hurts the most. The organisation has filed an application in the High Court in Pretoria for the declaration to be effected. Corruption Watch accuses the former Eskom officials of gross negligence and violating their duties. These include Brian Molefe, Anoj Singh, and former Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown. Corruption Watch Investigative head, Deborah Mutemwa-Tumbo, says they want the individuals to be held personally accountable for the damage that they have caused to the state-owned enterprise and ultimately South Africa’s economy. “More does need to be done to the extent that there has been criminality involved and that really is the domain of the criminal justice system. But as Corruption Watch, we do as much as we can, to ensure that, that apparatus is kicked into force through action such as laying charges but unfortunately our experience in the past has been that there has been no will on the part of the NPA, to pursue the charges,” says Mutemwa-Tumbo.
