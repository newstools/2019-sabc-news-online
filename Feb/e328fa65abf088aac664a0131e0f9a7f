Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has announced R3.5 billion stimulus projects intended to improve the country’s transport infrastructure. Nzimande says this is geared towards rebuilding investor confidence. The money will be spent on road construction and maintenance among other things. The projects are expected to further unlock R13 billion of investment in critical and strategic road infrastructure. Nzimande’s stimulus package is a response to President Cyril Ramaphosa‘ announcement of moves to get the economy going in last year’s State of the Nation Address. “ This stimulus and recovery plan consists of range of a range of measures, both financial and non-financial, that will be implemented immediately to firstly ignite economic activity, secondly restore investor confidence, thirdly prevent further job losses and create new jobs, and fourthly to address some urgent challenges that affect the conditions faced by vulnerable groups among our people. These measures will ensure that government gives priority to the areas of economic activity that will have the greatest impact on youth, women and small businesses.” Click below for stimulus package:
