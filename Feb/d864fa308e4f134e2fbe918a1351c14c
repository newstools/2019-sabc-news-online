Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, will later on Monday morning deliver the State of the Province Address (SOPA) at the Alberton Civic Centre in Gauteng’s East Rand. He will give a detailed account on the work done by the current administration to implement the ten-pillar programme of Transformation, Modernisation and Re-Industrialisation he announced when he took office in 2014. Makhura will also outline the provincial government’s programme of action for the year ahead. This is David Makhura’s last SOPA for this term of office. Coming just months before the May general elections, Makhura will highlight some of the successes of his tenure. “He will speak about the success in the township economy and the Tshepo 1million programme, which was initiated to create opportunities for young people,” says Thabo Masebe, Gauteng government Spokesperson. The Life Esidimeni tragedy will forever haunt Makhura’s administration.  Some will also view the seemingly indecisiveness on the e-tolling system as another challenge of Makhura’s leadership. The rampant crime and community protests over the slow delivery of houses have marred his administration. However, he will be emboldened by the improvement in the matric results and Quality of Life survey which found there’s been an improvement in the quality of life of the people of Gauteng despite the high levels of inequality.
