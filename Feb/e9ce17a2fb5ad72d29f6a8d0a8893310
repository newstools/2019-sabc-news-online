The ANC in the Eastern Cape believes the outcomes of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture and the PIC Inquiry can be the necessary tools towards the revival of the party. The Provincial Executive Council of the party has gathered in East London for a provincial lekgotla. The party’s provincial secretary, Lulama Ngcukayithobi, says the truth will come out of the commissions says, “Now we wanted to accept and appreciate what is happening in various commissions that are happening at a national level. Now some of those elements are taking care of the renewal of the ANC too, because they will be able to give out the truth behind some of the problems particularly corruption related issues that have been associated with the African National Congress.”  The party says it will set up a dedicated unit to monitor and assess the performance of its deployees in government every three months. This emerged on the second day of the party’s provincial lekgotla held in East London. It says the unit will be based at the party’s headquarters at Calata House at King William’s Town. The ANC has vowed to ensure that all cadres are deployed in appropriate positions and that those who are not performing are removed. “There’s already a format that we have designed that will deal with specific areas of deployment, but for individuals that are deployed we are going to do an assessment once every three months. The purpose of that performance appraisal is to do two things – to find if cadres that are deployed are appropriately deployed and give support where it is necessary. We cannot continue with comrades that are unable to discharge because of their deficiencies,” says Ngcukaitobi.
