The Mining and Energy advisor has called on whistleblowers to come forward with information on corrupt activities at Eskom. The advisor is making representations during public hearings by the National Energy Regulator (Nersa) at the Soweto Theatre.   Nersa is considering representations on the power utility’s proposed 15%t tariff hike. The Mining and Energy Advisor’s Ted Blom accused Eskom of stealing money and misleading the public about the real cost of electricity tariffs. “They know here the corruption is. They just haven’t cried out like Mr Aggrizi from Bosasa. So we need an “Eskom Mr Aggrizi” to show us where the corruption is. If that doesn’t happen we are asking you to appoint a forensic audit; because you and I will both know where the corruption has taken place and how much it’s been. But Eskom is not going to come forward. We’ve asked them for years to come forward since 2009 when coal corruption was only R8 billion a year.” Labour union, NUMSA has called for new management to be appointed at ESKOM. Union members are among protesters gathered outside the Soweto Theatre – where the National Energy Regulator is holding public hearings on the proposed electricity hikes. Inside the hearings, the Minerals Council warned that the increased tariff would cripple the mining industry. Numsa president Andrew Chirwa says “We oppose Eskom’s application. This is unfair to the poor. Once Eskom is allowed to increase electricity cost, we know that our economy is going to be worse. Jobs are going to suffer and people are going to be retrenched. Because once you increase electricity tariffs then there’s no doubt that the cost of business is going to be higher.”
