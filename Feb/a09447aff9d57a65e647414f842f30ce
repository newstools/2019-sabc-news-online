Police are trying to establish the motive for the murder of a Durban University of Technology (DUT) employee. Dr Euvette Taylor’s body was found at the Winterton residence on Steve Biko campus last week. Taylor’s death came just days after DUT student Mlungisi Madonsela was killed during students’ protests after a standoff with university security. DUT spokesperson, Alan Khan says Taylor’s passing is a tragic loss for the university community. “One of my colleagues Dr Taylor was a homeopath in the faculty of health. He was found deceased in his room in residence. He was also a residence advisor in the Steve Biko campus. His body was found in his room on the previous Sunday. Police are investigating that matter as well.”
