South Korea believes a successful reunification with North Korea is possible; talks between the US and North Korea to achieve this is scheduled for later in February in Vietnam. South Korea’s minister of unification says everyone’s pinning their hopes on a successful US-North Korea meeting. In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump announced bilateral talks with North Korea at the end of February. The first meeting was held in Singapore in June 2018. What emerged was an agreement to de-nuclearize the Korean Peninsula. It promoted peace and said the US and South Korea would cease joint military exercises. Since then, South Korea says relations between the North and the South have improved. Now it hopes the upcoming talks will yield tangible results. “I believe that if we can pursue the wish of common prosperity then the wish for peaceful re-unification it is,” said Chom Young Kun, the South Korean Minister of Unification. NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM. The US says diplomatic success depends on not repeating past mistakes.  Former US Vice President, Dick Cheney, says there’s always a temptation to get one more concession before an agreement can be signed. He says nuclear non-proliferation was non-negotiable. “Our team needs to resist this temptation, keeping the focus only on the objective. It has to be complete verifiable and irreversible dismantling of the North’s nuclear weapons.” Cheney also cautioned against those he deemed as threatening the US government. “America keeps its wish and more than this our word is backed by the military means.” Meanwhile, the South Korean government urged delegates to help peace efforts in the Korean Peninsula.
