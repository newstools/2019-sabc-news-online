Opposition parties in Parliament have for the second consecutive day criticised President Cyril Ramaphosa for not taking action when things were going wrong in the country in the past few years. The joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament is debating the State of the Nation Address (SONA). The parties allege that Ramaphosa did nothing when the economy suffered due to the actions of former President Jacob Zuma. Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald says, “But honourable president, where were you? (You) became the deputy president of the ANC in 2012, you became the deputy president of South Africa in 2014. So, where were you? What did you do in the 5-7 years – if this 9 years that has cost South Africa dearly its taxpayers (money)? You president are complicit to the loss of these 9 years whether you like it or not,” explains Groenewald. Watch the debate on SABC News:
