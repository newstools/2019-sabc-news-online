Head of Justice programme at the Institute for Security Studies Gareth Newham says it is very important for the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to get a sense of how the criminal justice system was affected by State Capture. Head of police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), Robert McBride is expected to testify on how law enforcement agencies failed to carry out their mandate, when he appears before the commission of inquiry into state capture at a date yet to be determined. Despite McBride taking the stand last week to give evidence, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo granted a postponement to give the implicated parties ample time to respond. Newham says the truth must come out on how agencies like the Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) were misused to support state capture. “And how the different components of the police, the Hawks, the NPA and IPID itself were misused either to promote and support those that were involved in cases of state capture and not held accountable, not prosecuted on the one hand.” “But also all those officials in this agencies who were trying to do their jobs and trying to do their investigations against top officials and politicians, on how they were forced out of their jobs illegally, subjected to counter investigations,” adds Newham.
