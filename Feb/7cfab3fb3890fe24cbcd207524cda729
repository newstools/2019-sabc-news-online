There appears to be another development in the ongoing trial of  the Jesus Dominion International Church pastor Timothy Omotoso in the Port Elizabeth High Court. The defence is likely to bring a new application in the matter this week. The SABC has reliably learnt that the judge has shares in one of the accommodation establishments which is used by witnesses in this case. The trial, which started in 2018, has been postponed to the 16th of April. Omotoso and his two co-accused face more than 90 sex-related charges. There is presently an appeal to the Constitutional Court, calling for Judge Mandela Makaula to recuse himself, as defence lawyer Peter Daubermann blames him for being biased towards first witness, Cheryl Zondi. It’s believed that the defence will bring evidence that witnesses stayed at a guest house, linked to Judge Makaula. Spokesperson for the office of the Chief Justice, Nathi Mncube has confirmed that they are aware of these allegations relating to shareholding in a guesthouse. He explained that an independent service provider places witnesses, after an administration process by the NPA.
