Police have fired rubber bullets to
disperse protesting students at the University of Venda in Limpopo. Students
were protesting at the university entrance. They’re demanding payment of NSFAS
allowances, cancellations of debts and that all students must be allowed to
register. Lectures have been boycotted. Some
students say they’d be unable to register as their outstanding fees are very
high. “We are striking because they are not giving
us our allowances others are not registering for free they are saying they will
only give those staying in camp the food allowance and also us staying outside
the camp they will only give us food vouchers and transport allowance we are
striking because they haven’t pay our money. I didn’t receive my transport
allowance however I did receive my transport allowance it has affected me
badly,” some students say.
