A teacher, who allegedly sexually assaulted 23 children at Valhalla Primary School in Pretoria, is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrateâ€™s Court on Friday morning. The man was arrested on Thursday following reports that 23 girls between the ages of 10 and 12 were inappropriately touched and sexually abused. He was suspended by the Gauteng
Education Department on Wednesday. The children came forward after the metro police hosted a workshop about safety, abuse and violence at the school last month. According to the department learners reported that the 55-year-old touched them in an inappropriate manner. The education department in Gauteng has arranged counselling for the learners. Last year, a scholar patrol guard who was charged with sexually assaulting pupils at the AB Xuma primary school in Soweto was acquitted of all charges due to insufficient evidence.
