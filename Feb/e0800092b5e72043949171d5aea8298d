The M2 motorway will be closed from Thursday morning to motorists as work to repair and restore the road gets underway. Authorities have advised motorists using the M2 to use alternative routes. The motorway will remain closed until at least October this year. Johannesburg MMC for Transport Nonhlanhla Makuba says while the plan was initially just for the closure of the M2 east-bound between Joe Slovo and Maritzburg Road, the structural damage to the carriageway has prompted more drastic action. “Engineers have discovered that part of the support structure has moved and that it is affecting the structural stability of some of the bridges on the M2 motorway. We have no option now but to close M2 fully between crown interchange and Maritzburg road. We humbly request residents and motorists to bear with us during this time and to understand that we are doing this to ensure their safety, which is a priority to the city.”   Click on video below:
