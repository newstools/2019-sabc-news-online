Advocate Shamila Batohi will on Friday officially take up her position as the new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed her in December 2018. Batohi will be the first woman to lead the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). She is the former director of public prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal and senior legal adviser at the International Criminal Court (ICC). During her interview for the position she likened taking up the NDPP position to jumping into a shark tank. Ramaphosa had until December 19th to appoint a replacement for ousted NDPP Shaun Abrahams, whose appointment was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court.   https://create.piktochart.com/output/34834396-ndpp-since-1998
