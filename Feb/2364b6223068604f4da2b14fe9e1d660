Morocco has recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia for consultations, indicating apparent cracks in relations between the traditional Sunni Muslim allies over Yemen, Qatar and Western Sahara, Moroccan media said on Friday. Ambassador Mustapha Mansouri confirmed the recall to
pro-establishment news website Le360. The Ambassador added that Morocco and Saudi Arabia are bound by
strong and longstanding ties that are currently undergoing a “transient
crisis”, Le360 reported. There was no official confirmation from
Morocco’s foreign ministry. Mansouri did not respond to a request for comment.
The Saudi embassy in Rabat declined to comment. A government official told Reuters on Thursday that the ambassador had been in Morocco for about a week, without specifying the reason. The recall is due to the airing by Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya
of a documentary that diverged from the Moroccan position on the Western Sahara
issue, the ambassador told Le360.
