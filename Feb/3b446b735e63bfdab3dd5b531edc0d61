Justice Minister Michael Masutha says Sondolo IT, a subsidiary of Bosasa,  will continue to supply security services at various court buildings pending the appointment of a new services provider on a quotation basis. Bosasa, now known as Africa Global Operations, has gone into liquidation after former COO Angelo Agrizzi implicated the company in tender rigging at the Correctional Services Department. Masutha was speaking during a press briefing in Pretoria. ” In 2008, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development was formally contracted to Sondolo IT for the supply, delivery, installation, commissioning, support and maintenance of the comprehensive CCTV and access control system. Following the delays in the finalisation process, considering the critical nature of the service, the department was left with no option but to keep the services of Sondolo IT pending the appointment of a new service provider on a quotation basis. The process is expected to be finalised soonest, hopefully by the end of the week.” Watch video below:
