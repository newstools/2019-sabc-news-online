Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has briefly appeared before the Newcastle Magistrateâ€™s Court in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The matter has been postponed to July 8 pending the outcome of the Pretoria High court matter. Malema appeared in court on a charge under the Riotous Assemblies Act after he allegedly incited party members to invade unoccupied land in Newcastle. In December, Malema took the matter to Pretoria High Court challenging the constitutionality of the Riotous Assembles Act. EFF members are waiting for Malema to address them outside court.
