The murder trial of a suspect arrested in connection with the killing of a nine-year-old Shallcross girl in a botched hijacking last year starts in the Durban High Court on Tuesday. Sadia Sukhraj was killed after her father’s car was hijacked on their way to school. A second suspect was killed in the
shoot-out. 35-year-old Sibonelo Mkhize is facing charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. It is believed that Mkhize
was part of three suspects that hijacked Sadia’s father’s car and made off with
the vehicle with the little girl still inside. This resulted in an exchange
of gunfire between the hijackers, Sadia’s father and an off-duty police officer
who was in the area at the time. This officer has been cleared of firing the fatal shot that killed the young girl. Click on videos below:
