Academic activities on all Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) campuses in Pretoria, Ga-Rankuwa, eMalahleni and Mbombela will remain suspended on Wednesday. This comes after students protested over a shortage of accommodation and the discontinuation of meal allowances for students who don’t reside in university accommodation. TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter says they will continue to closely monitor the situation on all campuses. The university has issued a statement stating that classes remain suspended. De Ruyter says that the institution prioritises the safety of students, staff and infrastructure. The university management says it will continue to engage with student leaders and other relevant role-players to reach amicable solutions.
