The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Shadow Health MEC in Gauteng, Jack Bloom, says government should find ways to exempt hospitals in the province from load shedding. In a statement, Bloom says a number of hospitals were affected by the recent planned power outages. Bloom says hospitals need protection from load shedding. “It’s a huge problem because even if the generators work, operations still have to be cancelled because they can only do emergency surgery and it’s not safe to do an operation when you’re operating on generated power and the real problem is that a hospital can’t fully function on generators. A lot of elective surgery has to be cancelled, the waiting lists are going to get longer and longer and the cost of diesel is very expensive.” Watch video below:
