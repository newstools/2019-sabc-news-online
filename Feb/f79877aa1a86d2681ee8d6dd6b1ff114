Johannesburg Water is working closely with City Power to minimise the impact of Eskom’s loadshedding on the provision of running water to communities. Johannesburg Water uses electricity to pump water. If there’s loadshedding of about four hours or more, this could lead to water provision challenges. Environment and Infrastructure services MMC in the City of Johannesburg Nico de Jager says he’s confident the city won’t experience water shedding as a result of loadshedding. “At this time water shedding is definitely not even an idea that we are even thinking about. It is rather how we manage the loadshedding in areas where we have reservoirs running low. On Wednesday, I had a meeting with people from City Power and Joburg Water and they will be working very closely together to monitor towers and reservoirs to see where they can reduce loadshedding and the impact in those areas,” adds Jager.
