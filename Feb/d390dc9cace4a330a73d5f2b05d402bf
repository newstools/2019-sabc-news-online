US President Donald Trump said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize because of his work in North Korea after President Barack Obama, he claims, almost went to war with the Asian nation. Recalling a discussion he had with Obama before taking office, Trump said he asked the former President what was the biggest problem he was facing. “He said, ‘By far, North Korea.’ And I don’t want to speak for him but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea. I think he was ready to go to war. In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea. Now where are we now? No missiles, no rockets, no nuclear testing, we have learned a lot. But much more importantly than all of it, much more important, much much more important than that is we have a great relationship. I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un,” he said. Trump added that Abe had given him a letter that he sent to the Nobel prize committee, nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. Trump said he doesn’t expect to win it, but cited that, “they gave it to Obama; he didn’t even know what he got it for.” In a controversial and stunning decision, the Nobel committee awarded the 2009 Peace Prize to Obama, in his first year in office. At the time, the Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Obama for “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” citing his fledgling push for nuclear disarmament and his outreach to the Muslim world.
