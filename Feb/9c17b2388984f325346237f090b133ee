SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe has been ordered to personally pay costs after losing a case at the Labour Court. Mxakwe, SABC Head of Legal Services, Ntuthutuzelo Vanara and Sandile July of Werksmans Attorneys, have all been ordered to pay court costs after the court overturned their decision to fire an employee. Nompumelelo Phasha, a General Manager
who reported directly to Vanara, claimed her dismissal was unfair and that the
SABC flouted its own disciplinary processes. The court took the extraordinary step of granting a punishing cost order against two SABC executives and a lawyer. The court granted all of the orders Phasha sought, finding that her summary dismissal was unlawful and should be set aside. The court granted this after finding that Phashaâ€™s
dismissal was unlawful as proper disciplinary processes were not followed. She had complained that there was a purge of all the employees who worked with former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The court ordered that she be reinstated.
