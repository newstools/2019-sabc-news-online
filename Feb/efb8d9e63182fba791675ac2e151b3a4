Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana says many of South Africa’s trade partners have relaxed trade restrictions on the export of processed products after the Foot and Mouth disease outbreak in Limpopo in January this year. Zokwana told the media in Pretoria that trade in safe commodities to direct neighbouring countries had largely been accepted. “We found only 4 500 animals outside the red zone, the red zone is the quarantined area that is known to be FMD infected, and those animals have been vaccinated and they will not mingle with other animals. We must ensure that no animals or products leave that new quarantine area and once that is done we can call on the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) to call off the ban,” says Zokwana.
