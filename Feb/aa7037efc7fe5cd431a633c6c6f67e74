Political Analyst from the University of the Free State Dr Sethulego Matebesi says he does not foresee the ANC Provincial Executive Committee (PEC), in the North West, resuming its duties. This follows a ruling on Tuesday by the High Court in Johannesburg that the PEC be reinstated within 48 hours. The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC disbanded the PEC last year and replaced it with the Provincial Task Team. Matebesi says he believes the ANC will try to resolve this matter internally.  He also does not foresee any decisions taken by the provincial task team since last year being reversed. “Only a couple of days are left for the reinstated or
the former provincial executive committee’s term to come to an end and I strongly
believe that the ANC will try by all means to try and resolve this internally.
I also foresee a situation where action will even be taken against Supra
Mahumapelo because he has been one of the advocates who indicated in the past
that ANC member should never take the organisation to court.” Meanwhile, no appeal has been lodged by the ANC NEC against the High Court decision as announced. A high powered delegation of top members led by Deputy President of the ANC David Mabuza is expected in Mahikeng to meet with the PEC. Click related video below:
