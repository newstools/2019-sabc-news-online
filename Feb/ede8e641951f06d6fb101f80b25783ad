Leader of the GOOD Party Patricia De Lille has vowed to uproot corruption in the North West government which she says it has been run to the ground. She was speaking in Rustenburg where she announced the party’s North West premier candidate, Vivian Law. Law is unknown in the provincial politics. Last week, the North West government announced that over R2 billion was lost to corruption. Scores of people, wearing t-shirts in the GOOD party’s orange colour, gave De Lille a rousing welcome. “The reason why they are so corrupt and the reasons they are stealing and eating for themselves is because people are not rising. We, Good people, we will fight them.” Click below for more on the story:
