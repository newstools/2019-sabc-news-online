Residents of Soweto in the south of Johannesburg will get world class care as a private cardiac facility opens in the area. The Gauteng Department of Health has given the Clinix Health Group a licence to operate the facility at its Dr SK Matseke Memorial Hospital in Diepkloof. Clinix is a black-owned health company that operates in various hospitals in South Africa. Dr Mpho Sebesho, a cardiologist with the Clinix Health Group, says there has been an increase in heart diseases among black men and women. “A lot of patients, particularly black patients, now recently a lot of them have these metabolic issues with heart attacks, diabetes, hypertension and all of that. The problem with these diseases is they’re all diseases of lifestyle. People don’t walk long distances that they used to walk when they used to live in rural areas. “People have cars, people don’t go to gym, you know. People watch TV essentially lead a very sedentary lifestyle. People are not active and even the food that we eat we eat a lot of processed food. Now I mean even youngsters it’s not uncommon to see a 30 year old who comes in with a massive heart attack and it’s all related to this diseases of lifestyle,” says Dr Sebesho.
