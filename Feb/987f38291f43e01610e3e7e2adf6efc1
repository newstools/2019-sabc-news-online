Former Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, turns 95-years-old on Thursday. The former President did not have his regular extravagant birthday celebrations even though the day has been declared a public holiday. The former veteran leader stepped down as the president of Zimbabwe after the military and his party Zanu-PF pushed for his resignation in 2017. A small family gathering took place at the Mugabe residence, “The Blueroof house,” in Harare where family members gathered to wish him well. Mugabe was toppled from power after being at the helm for 37 years. He became prime minister after Zimbabwe attained its independence from Britain in 1980. He became President in 1987. There was mixed reaction by Zimbabweans on social media with some wishing him well, while others lamenting the role he played in ruining the country’s economy.     Meanwhile, although it’s a holiday in Zimbabwe, there’s no fan fair for the former veteran leader, Robert Mugabe.  Two functions are lined up for Saturday – one with his friends and the other with sympathisers. While the Zanu-PF Youth wing will be holding a rally to mobilise support for current President, Emmerson Mnangagwa. For some, the former President will always be remembered for his revolutionary work, a giant political icon. But for others the fact that he is no longer in power should be a lesson for other leaders. He failed to leave a lasting legacy and divided Zimbabwe.    Robert Mugabe celebrates 95th birthday
