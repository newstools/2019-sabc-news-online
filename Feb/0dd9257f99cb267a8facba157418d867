Outgoing Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga is spending his last hours at the helm of the capital city. Msimanga is expected to formally vacate the office on Monday. He resigned last month to pursue his Gauteng Premier candidacy ahead of the 8 May elections. The Tshwane Council is expected to
elect a new mayor on Tuesday. Msimanga has faced his fair share of controversy over issues ranging from complaints about poor service delivery, allegations of prioritising affluent suburbs over struggling townships and employing unqualified staff at his offices. However, he says he is leaving his
post with a good conscious, knowing that he served the people of Tshwane with diligence. “I can subject myself to lifestyle audit if one should be called. We have said let there be an investigation and then from that investigation we will see what steps need to be taken.”
