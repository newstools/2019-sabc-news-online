Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has appointed a seven-member panel to interview candidates for the position of SARS commissioner. The position became vacant last November, when President Cyril Ramaphosa dismissed Tom Moyane, following a recommendation contained in the Nugent interim report. Mark Kingon has been acting in the position since Moyane’s suspension in March last year. The panel is chaired by former finance minister Trevor Manuel, and includes Treasury Deputy Director General Ismail Momoniat, Angela Bester, Justice Dennis Davis, Sindi Mabaso-Koyana, Advocate Thandi Orleyn and Fezekile Tshiqi. The Nugent Commission that was tasked
to look into governance issues at the Revenue Services recommended that
President Cyril Ramaphosa fire Moyane. In December, the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Moyane’s bid to have his dismissal overturned. The advertisement for the position of SARS Boss stated that the ideal candidate will have to behave honestly and with integrity and be able to leverage diversity. Applications closed on the 18th of last month. Click on video below:
