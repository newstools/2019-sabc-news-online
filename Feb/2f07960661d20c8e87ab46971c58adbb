Cape Town politician, Patricia de Lille, says her newly- formed party is based on four pillars. The former city mayor and her executive will launch the election manifesto for their party Good in the Mother City on Tuesday morning. She says the focus of their turnaround strategy for South Africa is urbanisation, race, economic justice and the sensitive debate around land expropriation in the country. “And then of course the current debate is around land reform, our position is very clear, we have been watching the debate and the public sittings around land reform and land expropriation, and we feel that there is no need to have the constitution, section 25, amended.”
