A group of Zimbabwean nationals are protesting outside Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town where Zimbabwe’s vice president, Constantino Chiwenga, is apparently receiving treatment. The group is calling for Chiwenga to be sent back home to undergo treatment there. One of the protesters Edmore Magumisi says they want him to experience first-hand how ordinary Zimbabweans are being treated with their own health system. “We have a very bad service in Zimbabwe. Our hospitals are down. We don’t have medicine. We don’t have good service delivery. If we consider the health facilities that are being offered in Zimbabwe we can’t expect this vice president to come here and get treatment while our brothers and sisters are dying in Zimbabwe. He must go and get the same treatment that our brothers and sisters are getting in Zimbabwe. We don’t want him here.”   Meanwhile the Western Cape Health Department has said that Zimbabwe’s Vice President is not being treated at Cape Town’s Groote Schuur Hospital. In a statement, the provincial health department has urged protestors to contact their consulate on the matter. It, however, maintains that no details of patients will be given out to the public.
