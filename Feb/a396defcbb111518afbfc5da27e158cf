KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willis Mchunu has been admitted to a hospital in Pietermaritzburg after collapsing during his State-of-the-Province Address. The sitting of the KZN provincial legislature had to be temporarily adjourned after Mchunu collapsed. Seventy year-old Mchunu has in the past few months been out of the public eye with Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala acting as premier. Zikalala had to take over and complete Mchunu’s speech. A short while ago, African National Congress (ANC) provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli told the media that Mchunu was in a stable condition. “We’ve had a telephone discussion with the premier who’s very stable at the hospital. Depending on the time at which he completes the exercises he’s undergoing with the doctors, return back to have lunch with all of us here before he returns back to his house. So his condition is quite well, he’s very jovial and he’s just waiting for the medical doctors to clear him and permit him to exit hospital so that he can briefly join us before going to his house,” says Ntuli.
