Former Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services Dennis Bloem is expected to shed some light on the dealings between Bosasa and the Correctional Services Department. Bloem will take the witness stand on Friday at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Friday morning. Bloem, who is currently the Congress of the People (COPE) National Spokesperson, chaired the committee for five years between 2004 and 2009 as an African National Congress (ANC) MP. He is among those who advocated for the state capture commission to take place. On Thursday, former Bosasa IT Guru Leon van Tonder told the commission how being humiliated by his former boss Gavin Watson led to his resignation from the company in May 2018. Meanwhile, Global Technology Systems employee Richard Le Roux dropped a bombshell when he testified that ANC National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe had his three properties upgraded alongside other cabinet ministers. It’s not yet clear whether the ANC will act on Mantashe on the matter. Watch the video below for related news:
