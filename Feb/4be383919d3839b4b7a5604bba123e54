Several African National Congress (ANC) members of Parliament’s Police Committee have refused to discuss allegations by the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), Robert McBride, that political consideration could have led to his contract not being renewed. The committee is sitting for the second day to discuss whether they agree with Police Minister Bheki Cele that McBride’s contract should not be renewed. McBride has argued that his contract is not being renewed because IPID has been investigating several sensitive political issues. He also states that he will be naming many police officers when he testifies before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. ANC MPs like Jerome Maake says this is a non-issue of discussion. “I don’t think that is what we’re asked to deal with. (We) must strike that one out; political whatever. I don’t think our duty is to discuss political issues. We deal with facts here!” says Maake. Watch related video below for more on the story:
