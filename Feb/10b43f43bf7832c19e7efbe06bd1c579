Zimbabwean teachers have suspended a national strike seeking better pay, unions said on Sunday, but warned that they could walk out from their jobs again if the government did not meet their demands. Teachers went on strike on February 5
after negotiations between the government and public-sector workers broke down,
heightening political tension after last month’s violent protests that were met
by a security crackdown. Teachers’ unions met Education
Minister Paul Mavima in Harare and agreed to return to work on Monday. The two biggest unions, the Zimbabwe Teachers Association and the Progressive Teachers’ Union, said after the meeting that the government should take advantage of the “detente to introspect and come up with well thought out, meaningful, and long-lasting solutions on the salaries grievances”. Failure by the government to meet
their demands would see teachers going back on strike, the unions said, giving
no timeline. Mavima could not immediately be
reached for comment. Teachers, like other public-sector
workers, are demanding US dollar salaries and an increase in allowances to
cushion them against soaring inflation and economic hardship. There are more than 100 000 public-sector teachers in Zimbabwe and unions say 80% of them are on strike. The unions have accused state security
agents of intimidating and harassing their members by visiting schools and taking
down names of teachers on strike. Zimbabwe’s government spends more than 90% of the national budget on salaries and had promised to reduce this to around 70% in 2019.
