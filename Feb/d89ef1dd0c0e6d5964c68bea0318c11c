The Department of Water and Sanitation is urging residents of Polokwane in Limpopo to use water sparingly. Polokwane previously experienced water cuts due to a variety of problems, including the interruption of electricity supply and the presence of mud in the water at some of its plants. Spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says water levels at dams such as Ebenezer have improved compared to last year currently standing at 64.36%. He says although there have not been water cuts recently, some dam levels have remained low. “We are aware that we have been experiencing quite high temperatures but the decline has generally not been that terrible,” says Ratau.
