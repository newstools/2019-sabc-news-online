International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says lifting sanctions against Zimbabwe would boost the country’s economic growth. This as Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa is put under pressure, especially from human rights groups and sections of the international community, since the army was deployed to quell protests last month. At least 17 people were killed after an army-led crackdown last month. Many more have suffered various human rights violations. Speaking in Parliament during a debate on the State of the Nation Address, Sisulu said that South Africa would do whatever it took to help ease the crisis gripping Zimbabwe. “Zimbabwe has had an on-going, challenging socio-economic situation which has inadvertently had an impact on us in South Africa. The president has been in engagements with the president of Zimbabwe, and we now have a clearer picture of what is happening in Zimbabwe. As such we stand ready to assist the country in addressing the challenges that face Zimbabwe because they impact on us. We would like to express our support for the lifting of sanctions against Zimbabwe in order to allow for economic development in that country.” Click on videos below:
