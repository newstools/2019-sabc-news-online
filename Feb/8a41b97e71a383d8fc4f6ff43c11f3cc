The case of an East Rand grade nine pupil has taken centre stage at the CRL commission. Bongiwe Ngobese told the commission how teachers at Sunward Park High in Boksburg victimised her because of her ancestral calling. Teachers have denied calling the 16-year-old a demon, saying they were concerned about her psychological well being and acceptance by fellow learners. Ngobese explained to the commission about an incident at school before her initiation. In a spiritual trance, she passed out in class. She says educators sprayed her with anointing oil and made her swallow it in an attempt to exorcise her of demons. The pupil said she was asked to remove her beads, as it was tantamount to advertising her services. Her parents say continued victimisation prompted them to approach the commission. The alleged incidents took place between 2017 and 2019. Educators says they always acted in the best interest of the pupil. However, the deputy principal said when he had tried to speak to his colleagues about the incidents, he was met with resistance. Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi was scheduled to appear before the commission. Following Lesufi’s no show, the commission will now be opening a case against him. The learner has since returned to school. She’s been requested to wear long sleeve shirts to cover her beads. The commission will release a report on the matter.
