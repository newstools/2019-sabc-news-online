Convicted racist Vicki Momberg’s appeal against her sentence will on Wednesday be heard in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. Momberg was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria in 2017 after a video circulated on social media showing her shouting racial slurs at police officers. The officers were assisting her after she was involved in a smash-and-grab incident. She used the k-word 48 times. She was sentenced to three years in prison with one year suspended in March 2018 and was previously denied leave to appeal. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
