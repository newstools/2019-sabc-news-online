Consumers in areas affected by loadshedding in and around Pretoria have resorted to using alternative energy supplies. This has on the other hand put pressure on retail businesses as some products are selling faster than others, making it difficult to meet the current demand. Generators and rechargeable lamps are some of the items that consumers are opting for. Eskom resumed Stage 3 loadshedding which started at 08:00 on Wednesday morning and is scheduled to end at 23:00. The power utility says it has a shortage of capacity because a number of generating units are out of service due to breakdowns. PensionerBetty Wagenaar was shopping at a hardware store in Gezina east of Pretoria. “I’m looking for a sun rechargeable light. This one is rechargeable by battery for sixty hours. So I want the sun chargeable one, it’s cheaper than the one chargeable by electricity and now also the fridge is off, everything inside has defrosted. It’s frustrating a lot. So I’m now shopping for a sun rechargeable light.” Meanwhile, Martin le Roux who operates a mobile restaurant in the area says he prefers using generators and gas in times like these. “Basically what we normally do is if the power is off we switch over to a generator. And at home most of my stuff is gas. My stove, geyser is gas. So for me alternatively, gas is the best option,” says Le Roux.
