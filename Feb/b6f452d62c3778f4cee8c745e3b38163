Three people allegedly involved in a love triangle have died in Ribacross village in Burgersfort in Limpopo. Police say a man in his 30’s allegedly torched a rented room belonging to a 35-year-old man and another room belonging to his girlfriend. Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says the suspect also died after he entered one of the rented rooms which had caught fire. “Acting Police Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in Limpopo Major General Jan Scheepers has condemned in the strongest possible terms the continuous acts of domestic related attacks and killings which are still prevalent in some parts of the province,” says Ngoepe. “This condemnation emanates from an incident, which occurred in the early hours of this morning outside Tubatse policing area outside Burgersfort where three people died and one minor child injured, our investigations in this matter are continuing.”
