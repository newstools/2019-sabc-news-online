The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament has denied an allegation that it is trying to delay the process of filling eight vacancies on the South African Broadcasting Cooperation (SABC) board. The process of shortlisting and interviewing candidates was supposed to have started in January. ANC Member of Parliament Mzwamadoda Kalako says as far as they’re concerned, the process of vetting and verifying qualifications of those who have applied has not yet been finalised. “I am not even sure that the chairperson has already received all the names of those who applied and then those people must be vetted by parliamentary security because we are helped by them. That’s what we are waiting for,” says Kalako. Earlier the DA says it is concerned that there seems to be no urgency to fill vacancies on the SABC board. DA’s spokesperson on Communications Phumzile van Damme says this is worrisome considering that Parliament will rise soon begin to prepare for the May elections.
