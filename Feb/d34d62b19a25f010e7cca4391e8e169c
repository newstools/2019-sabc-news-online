Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has called for the transformation of South Africa’s maritime sector. He was speaking in Durban at the first of a series of dialogues that the transport sector and stakeholders have hosted. The two-day dialogue in the port city will focus on the key challenges and opportunities that the maritime industry is facing. Both public and private stakeholders including the South African Maritime Safety Authority, Transnet, Port Regulator South Africa as well as labour unions have delivered presentations on progress made in the industry. Nzimande says the sector has the potential to create more than one million jobs. “This sector is notorious for being untransformed. 25 years now into our democracy it’s still largely white, still exclusive. So, we have not as yet really reached the level that we need to reach. The main aim really is to bring all the stakeholders to answer the main two questions; why is there no transformation in this sector and secondly, what do we need to do in order to reach transformation?”
