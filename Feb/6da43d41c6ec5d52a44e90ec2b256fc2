The Democratic Alliance (DA) has lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) over a lack of water supply in the four towns of the troubled Masilonyana Municipality in the Free State. For over a decade, residents in the Masilonyana Municipality have been grappling with water shortages. The matter was previously investigated by the Human Rights Commission. A damning report was released a few years ago, but to date little has changed. The HRC has again been asked to step in. “Our toilets are blocked, we are also struggling with water as citizens of Brandfort. I would like to see change, we are struggling with water, it’s always been a matter in Brandfort.,” says one of the residents. At least 23 towns in the Free State have experienced water shortages over the past years, at times, leading to violent service delivery protests. DA councillor George Machalakis Masilonyana says, “The circumstances that people of Masilonyana have to live under are appalling. We would like the HRC to investigate this problem and to come with a finding that indeed the municipality is violating people’s rights.” The HRC says urgent measures are needed to avoid a deepening water crisis. Free State HRC’s Thabang Kheswa says, “It’s a very serious issue as water is a constitutional right. The situation has to be arrested if challenges prove to be serious at the municipality.” Meanwhile, authorities in the Masilonyana Municipality say they’re already dealing with the crisis. And water restrictions would lead to sparse supply in some areas. The African National Congress (ANC) insists that municipalities remain committed to tackling water challenges in the province.
