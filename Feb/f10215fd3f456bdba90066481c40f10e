The Durban University of Technology (DUT) has confirmed that two security guards alleged to have been involved in a scuffle with students on Tuesday have been suspended. 20-year-old student Mlungisi Madonsela was shot and killed when the scuffle broke out outside the Steve Biko campus in central Durban. Two other people were seriously
injured. Four suspects arrested have appeared
in court and the case has been struck off the roll. DUT
vice-chancellor Professor Thandwa Mthembu confirms the suspension of the two
guards involved. “Yes I can confirm because there have been engagements also with the security company. There were taken in on Tuesday and were released on Wednesday. I do understand that the police are doing further investigations.” Click on video below:
