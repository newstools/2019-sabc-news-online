The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume on Monday morning in Parktown, Johannesburg. The Commission is expected to hear the testimony from officials in the National Treasury, including former Director General (DG) Lungisa Fuzile. Fuzile appeared before the commission last year, where he told Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, of the comedy of errors which he witnessed, when Des van Rooyen was appointed as finance minister for just two days in December 2015. The former DG also told the commission of how Van Rooyen was accompanied by three advisors – allegedly supplied by the Guptas – on his arrival in the department. Last week former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP) Vytjie Mentor was at the inquiry again. The commission put Mentor’s evidence under the microscope and exposed a number of apparent inconsistencies. However, Mentor insisted she had met one of the Gupta brothers on an official trip to China. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
