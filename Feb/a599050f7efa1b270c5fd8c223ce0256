The case between Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and EFF leaders Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu, will be heard in the Equality Court sitting in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Gordhan wants the EFF
leaders to be charged with crimen injuria, incitement of public violence and
defamation. Last year,  Malema launched an attack on Gorhan outside the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg – alleging that Gorhan had benefited from the looting of government. But in their application, Malema and Shivambu have challenged the Equality Court’s jurisdiction saying a higher court should hear the matter. Click on video below:
