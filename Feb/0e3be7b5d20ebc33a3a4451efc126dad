Nigeria’s main political opposition on Saturday said it had been forced to cancel a key presidential campaign rally in the capital Abuja and blamed President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling party. Atiku Abubakar and
his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had been due to hold the event in the Garki
area of the city, with just a week to go until polling day. However, the PDP said it had been denied access to the Old
Parade Ground venue, despite making payments and having obtained official
approval. “The PDP invites Nigerians to document this provocative
action against our party and our presidential campaign by the Buhari Presidency
and the APC (All Progressives Congress),” says the opposition. Nigerians go to the polls next Saturday with Buhari, 76, seeking
a second four-year term. Abubakar, a 72-year-old former vice-president is his leading
challenger. Abubakar and the PDP have accused Buhari and the APC of
trying to scupper their campaign because they fear the race will be close. Buhari was on Saturday scheduled to hold a similar rally in
the commercial hub, Lagos. Abubakar is pencilled in to visit next week. “We hope they will allow the Lagos rally to hold on
Tuesday,” says the party. APC spokesperson, Lanre Isa-Onilu, said the party did not
own the Abuja venue, “so there is no way we could have denied them access
to a place we don’t own and we don’t have control over”. “If there is any truth to what the PDP has said, it is
not APC and it is not our policy,” says Isa-Onilu. There was no immediate comment from the authorities at the APC-run Federal Capital Territory administration. Watch a related video below:
