It will take at least four days for power to be restored to some areas of Centurion in Pretoria which have been without power since Friday night. The Brakfontein sub-station was struck by lightning on Friday night, leading to the damage of two transformers. Amberfield, Rooihuiskraal, Heuweloord, Hennopspark and Wierda Park are some of the affected suburbs. Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has assured residents that they will work around the clock to ensure that power is restored. “It will take them around 3-4 days holistically to solve the problem, but it will be a gradual process where they will be switching on the light to the residence. So, I can assure the citizens of Tshwane, in most particular those ones who live in the affected areas, that electricity will be switched on as soon as possible.”
