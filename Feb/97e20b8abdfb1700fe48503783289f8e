Acting Eskom Senior General Manager Dan Mashigo has told the State Capture Commission that despite having other coal mines nearer Majuba Power Station, 50% of the coal acquired for Majuba Power Station came from Tageta Brakfontein coal mine. Mashigo says coal from Brakfontein was predominantly transported by road which is relatively more expensive than rail. This is despite Brakfontein having a rail route between the mine and Majuba. In 2015, Mashigo was the acting general manager for coal operations at Eskom – a function that executes the contract and supply to various stations. “Coal delivered by rail we pre certify before its dispatched. At any given point in time, we have got more than 2 000 coal trucks that are basically moving the Eskom coal consignment. Brakfontein is very remote to Majuba power station. The traveling distance by road of probably close to 200 and by rail like 180 and its one of those that we do the pre certification. Majuba would require about 40 million tonnes to make sure that it can provide power and Brakfontein acquired about 15% coal consumption. Brakfontein was amongst the furthest from Majuba power station,” says Mashigo. Click link for more on the story:
