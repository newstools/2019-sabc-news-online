Civil society groups are expected to stage pickets at the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) hearings in Soweto on Friday. NERSA is holding nationwide hearings on what Eskom can charge consumers for electricity for the years ahead. Eskom announced last year that it has asked Nersa for a 15% electricity tariff increase per year for the three financial years. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), the Soweto Action Committee and the Democratic Alliance (DA) are among organisations that will be picketing at the hearings; calling on Nersa not to grant Eskom the proposed increase. City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba is expected to make a presentation at the hearing, opposing Eskom’s proposed tariff increase. Numsa Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says granting Eskom a tariff hike would be disastrous for the economy. “In our submissions we will be making it very clear that we reject any request for a tariff increase for Eskom. We believe that a tariff increase will be disastrous not only for the working class and poor, but also for industry. Our economy can just not afford an increase in the electricity price. This is a situation that has spiralled way out of control and it is completely immoral that Eskom should be allowed to increase its tariffs at this time, says Hlubi. The hearings will move to the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand north of Johannesburg on Monday. Watch the video below for related news:
