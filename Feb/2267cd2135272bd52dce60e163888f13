The mother of the baby who was rescued from a storm water drain in Newlands East north of Durban last week will appear in court soon and will be charged with attempted murder. The baby girl who is still in hospital survived after being trapped inside the storm water pipes for several hours. A person passing by the area heard the baby crying and alerted the authorities. The rescue of the infant has been dubbed a miracle mission. Provincial police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the mother of the infant is currently under police guard in a Durban hospital. “A 27-year-old mother was arrested in the local hospital in Durban. She was arrested during the day as we are talking. She is under police guard. She will be charged and appear in court very soon facing charges of attempted murder this is after the new born baby found in Newlands East last week.”  Click on video below:
