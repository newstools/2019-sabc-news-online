Former President Jacob Zuma‘s advisor, Lakela Kaunda, will not cross-examine former ANC MP, Vytjie Mentor, when the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture resumes in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday morning, as was earlier reported. However, the Commission will hear testimony from Mentor who will complete her evidence and will be cross-examined by some of those granted leave to cross-examine her. They include Hawks’ Advocate Mandla Mtolo and Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi. Commission spokesperson, Reverend Mbuyiselo Stemela says, “You will recall that Ms Lakela Kaunda was granted leave to cross-examine Ms Vytjie Mentor and also advocate Mtolo and Major-general Mnonopi. So those are the three people who are going to cross-examine Ms Mentor.”  Watch related video below:
