The minister of Communications,  Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, says that the Ministry of Communications has been mandated to spearhead and lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution, working with other stakeholders within and outside government. Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams participated in a meeting of the Portfolio Committee on Telecommunications and Postal Services earlier on Tuesday.  This was the first engagement between Ndabeni-Abrahams and the Committee in her current responsibility as Minister. The committee was based on the Electronic Communications Amendment Bill, which was tabled before Parliament in October 2018, followed by public hearings involving various stakeholders including the regulated firms. “Expansion of the Ministry’s mandate and the reconfigured
department has implications for policy and legislation as we are now required
to think anew; off course building on the advances of the past 25 years of
democratic regulation”, says Ndabeni-Abrahams. “The Fourth Industrial Revolution is in our midst which calls for us to rethink our approach to everything we do, including the kind of institutions that will lead and enable the Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Click link below for more on the story:
