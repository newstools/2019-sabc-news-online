The Gauteng Department of Education says they have borrowed R8.5 billion to eradicate all unsafe schools in the province. MEC Panyaza Lesufi says his department is targeting schools that are made out of asbetos, mobile schools and schools that are old. Lesufi says structural engineers will be sent to schools facing infrastructure challenges to determine the help they need. He was addressing the School Governing Bodies at a meeting he convened to discuss schools infrastructure. The meeting follows a tragedy in Hoërskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark were a walkway killed four learners two weeks ago. “We also want to keep maintenance, all forms of maintenance; prohibitive maintenance, corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance; so that our schools must not be death traps for our children. What has happened in Hoërskool Driehoek has opened our eyes and that is the reason we have convened this meeting so that we become proactive so rather than wait for the incident to happen and cry foul,” explains Lesufi.
