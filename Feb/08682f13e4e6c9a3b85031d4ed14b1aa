The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has approved over 300 000 applications for funding. Despite this, several students have taken to social media, claiming that their applications were rejected without the Scheme providing any reasons. Others claim that they have not yet received funding from NSFAS for this year. The South African Union of Students (SAUS) Spokesperson, Thabo Shingange, says it’s understood that around 65 000 applications were rejected. “As a union, we don’t take lightly to 65 000 applications being rejected but it does call us to look deeper into the matter into understanding what is the basis of these rejections. We have been receiving complaints from students saying that some of them have been rejected on the basis that their family/household income is more than R122 000, which turns out to be false. So in that process we are reviewing some of those rejections and receiving positive feedback from NSFAS itself. We are saying as a union of students that no eligible student should be left behind in the process including being rejected by arbitrary means,” says Shingange. Watch a related video below:
