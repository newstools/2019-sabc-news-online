In a statement, Buhari urged Nigerians to “refrain from all civil disorder and remain peaceful”. He expressed disappointment at the delay but added that he remains committed to ensuring the credibility of the vote. Electoral officials have cited logistical concerns for the delay, saying the vote has been rescheduled for Saturday, the 23rd of February. The presidential election campaign has been dominated by Buhari and his main challenger, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar.
