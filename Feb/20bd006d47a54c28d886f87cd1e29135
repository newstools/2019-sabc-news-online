The SABC says it is considering its options following a scathing Labour Court judgement. On Wednesday, the court found that the public broadcaster had unlawfully dismissed General Manager Nompumelelo Phasha. The court found that the SABC flouted its own disciplinary processes and directed that its CEO Madoda Mxakwe, Head of Legal Services Ntuthutuzelo Vanara and Sandile July of Werksmans Attorneys, pay court costs when it overturned their decision to fire an employee. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu says the organisation is considering its next step. She says the judgement in the labour court is not in relation to the gross misconduct charges and allegations that the SABC has levelled against Ms Phasha, but rather on the processes undertaken in the dismissal against the organisation. She says, “The SABC is currently considering options including appealing and it will not publicly discuss at this stage how its gonna handle this matter. What we would like to reinforce is that the decision does not mean she is re-instated, it simply means we go back to the point where she is on suspension.” Phasha, a General Manager who reported directly to Vanara, claimed her dismissal was unfair and that the SABC flouted its own disciplinary processes. She had complained that there was a purge of all the employees who worked with former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. For more watch below:
