Residents of Nomakanjani informal settlement in Port Elizabeth have staged a protest calling for the Nelson Mandela Metro to provide them with services. They want water, electricity, sanitation and that they remain on the land earmarked for RDP housing. They’ve been evicted more than once previously but they insist that they are going nowhere. The disgruntled residents closed Addo road near Kamvelihle with burning tyres on Thursday, demanding that executive mayor, Mongameli Bobani respond to their demands. Bobani has given a time frame of a month to connect electricity in their shacks and three weeks to bring taps closer to them. “We have agreed that within 4 weeks we are going to bring in the contractor to start to put in electricity to the shacks, we got the budget for that. We have agreed that there is a resolution that was taken, that resolution is clear, residents cannot be removed from where they are staying. Even on the water, we said there is a line already here, there are taps but they want taps closer. So we are going to do that in three weeks-time,” says Bobani.
