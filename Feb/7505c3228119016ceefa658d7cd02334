Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha’s State of the Province Address (SOPA) degenerated into chaos. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members were forcefully ejected from the sitting in Polokwane. A post-SOPA altercation between EFF members of the Limpopo Legislature and security personnel. The EFF took issue with the singing of African National Congress (ANC) struggle songs during the sitting. They accused the ruling party of turning the house into a playground. Opposition parties were not swayed by the premier. EFF’s Jossey Buthane says:”Children continue to die in pit toilets but the premier is saying there is proper infrastructure.” Earlier, Premier Stan Mathabatha said no stone would be left unturned in getting those implicated in the VBS Bank looting prosecuted. Mathabatha says:”On our part as government we have since referred the report to law enforcement agencies for necessary action. We have also referred reports to the affected locals for further action.” The ANC in Limpopo said the State of the Province Address showed that the party was achieving its goals. Click video below:
