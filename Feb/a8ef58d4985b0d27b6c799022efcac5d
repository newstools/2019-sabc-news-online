The Durban Magistrate’s Court has released the mother of a newborn who was found dumped in a medical waste box at the King Edward hospital on warning. The 20-year-old mother is facing a charge of attempted murder. She gave birth to the infant at the hospital prematurely. The child was kept in hospital in order to gain weight. The baby boy survived the ordeal and is still in hospital. The news of the baby almost killed with the King Edward neonatal ward shocked many over the weekend.  The mother allegedly tried to kill her child by putting the infant in a pillow and dumping his tiny body in a medical waste at the hospital’s neonatal ward. The baby boy almost died while inside a medical waste bin. Doctors did not take any chances and immediately put the infant on antibiotics. The mother was immediately arrested. On Monday, the 20-year-old appeared very scared in court when she was read the charge against her. The young mother requested the assistance of Legal Aid. She told the court she would be pleading not guilty. She did not divulge much details. She told the court that she is currently doing Grade 12 in a school in Kwa-Mashu, north of Durban. The mother, who is a scholar, will be back on the 25th of April in court. Meanwhile, the baby who was rescued in a storm water in Newlands East, north of Durban, is recovering well at a Durban hospital. The Department of Social Development in the province says the child will be released into their care once she is discharged in hospital.
