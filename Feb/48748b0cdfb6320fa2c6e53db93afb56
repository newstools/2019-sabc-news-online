The family of veteran jazz singer Dorothy Masuku has described her as a loving person. She passed away at the age of 83 at her home in Johannesburg, on Saturday, surrounded by her family. Masuku’s song Dr Malan was banned in South Africa. She also sang at the inauguration of then Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) leader who was later assassinated, Patrice Lumumba. That led to Masuku being exiled from her home country of southern Rhodesia, which became Zimbabwe after independence in 1980. Family spokesperson and Masuku’s grandson, Fortune Hute says, “She was a loving grandmother. She passed on today [Saturday] at 1 pm in the comfort of her home. She had her grand-kids and the children around her when she passed on in Johannesburg south. She struggled with hypertension for a while now since last year, until the time of her death today.” Masuku was born on September 3, 1935, in Bulawayo, in the former Southern Rhodesia which is now called Zimbabwe. She was the fourth of seven children.  Tributes pour in In a Twitter post, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said a Baobab tree has fallen with her passing.   Political party, COPE has lauded the late veteran jazz musician, Dorothy Masuku, as an activist that contributed to the freedom of all South Africans. The political party sent out condolences to Masuku’s family, friends and fellow musicians. COPE’s spokesperson, Dennis Bloem says, “We know that her voice may be silent, but her music will live forever with us. We want to plead and urge the young generation to follow in her footsteps. May her soul rest in peace.”
