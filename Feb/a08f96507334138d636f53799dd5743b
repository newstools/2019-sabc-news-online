Eastern Cape Transport, Safety and Liaison MEC Weziwe Tikana, says collaborations between traditional authorities, communities and the police are key in curbing crime. This emerged at the launch of the February Safety Month Programme at Mngqesha Great Place outside King William’s Town. The launch takes place amid increasing gender-based violence particularly in rural areas. The latest incidents of rape happened at Khalonkomo Village outside Qumbu where women in the area have resorted to sleep in groups after the alleged rape of three women. Tikana says it will take joint efforts to curb such crimes. “As the province of the Eastern Cape, we are rolling out the concept of traditional policing which is a concept of strengthening our relations with traditional authorities and traditional councils. At local level, they are the ones that are able to know and easily be informed on whatever area of crime that’s taking place in communities,” says Tikana. Nomonde Makubalo says they are struggling to deal with crime. “Our challenge is rape, house breaking. Those people who are coming from the tarvens are being raped by the thugs and there are also house breakings here,” says Makubalo.
