The Pretoria Magistrate’s Court is on Thursday expected to hand down judgment in the bail application of a teacher accused of sexually assaulting more than 20 learners. The male teacher, from a primary school in Valhalla, Centurion, Pretoria faces 24 charges of sexual assault, common assault and crimen injuria. His alleged victims are between the ages of ten and 14. Various organisations, including the “NOT IN MY NAME” movement attended the bail hearing. Spokesperson Themba Masango, says the suspect should be denied bail. “We don’t want the situation where we have to the public and communities out there taking the law into their own hands. It’s not a veiled threat, it’s a genuine call, because  as you know over 200 parents singed a petition to say the man should not come back and he should be kept in until the trial is set. We’ve got civil organisations also enraged about what happened. We don’t want a situation like we had in Mamelodi last week.” Click on videos below:
