The Congress of the People (COPE) says it will lay charges of hate speech against members of Black First Land First (BLF) following remarks made after four children died when a bridge collapsed at Hoërskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark on Friday. COPE spokesperson Dennis Bloem says they will also lay a formal complaint at the Human Rights Commission. He says BLF made “racist utterances” when they said the bridge “collapsed to punishment learners for the sins of their fathers…” “We are really very angry with what the BLF has said when they were saying the Gods and the ancestors are punishing these children when this four children died. It is unacceptable that the BLF must come out and spread more hatred amongst our people and want to drive our country into a civil war. We are not going to leave this thing because it’s unacceptable.” Click on video below:
