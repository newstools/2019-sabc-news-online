Protesting villagers in the Eastern Cape, who blockaded the R61 between Ntlaza and Port St John’s, were dispersed by a special unit of the police. They’re complaining about an unfulfilled promise to fix a bad road which leads to two villages. The community leaders have vowed to use their vote to fight the battle, this after motorists were stranded for hours while protesting residents blocked the road. They diverted vehicles to the dilapidated T191 which is the cause of their unhappiness. But it was not long before the public order policing unit arrived to disperse them. Resident, Nompumelelo Meji says the mayor made promises “The mayor had promised us that the road to Mampume will be tarred. We are protesting for roads and they don’t even listen to use but disperse us like that. We feel disrespected, we will not vote for the ruling party instead we will take our votes to other parties.” Another resident, Luzuko Teno says the roads need to be fixed. “We are complaining about the poor road infrastructure. The road is in a poor state and is a danger to our community.” The transport department says the plan is to re-gravel the Majola Road in the first quarter of 2019/2020.
