The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will oppose Eskom’s application for electricity tariff increase as they believe the crisis at the power utility is self-made. DA members have joined a number of civil society groups picketing outside the Soweto Theatre where the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) is holding public hearings on Eskom’s application. Eskom announced last year that it has asked Nersa for a 15% electricity tariff increase per year for the three financial years. DA MP Natasha Mazzone says tariff increases will put an unbearable burden on the poor. She says, “We don’t think that South Africans should bear the brunt of having to pay for maladministration, corruption and ineptitude of the Eskom board. Also we will be presenting to parliament the final version of our cheaper electricity bill where we will be looking at separating the monopoly hold on of Eskom and we strongly urge Nersa to look at our suggestions and to make a determination on the increase they give to Eskom based on our submission.” Click below to watch related videos:
