Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police has expressed concern on reports that since March 2018 more than 185 people have been killed in gang-related violence on the Cape Flats. As a result, the committee has invited
representatives of civic organisations and community leaders in gang-infested
areas to discuss the matter. “The committee will on Tuesday evaluate the current anti-gang strategy of the South African Police Services with communities from gang-infested areas. It will be the first meeting of the committee this year.” It has invited community
groups from four provinces notorious for gang-related incidents. They are
Gauteng, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and the Free State. Committee Chairperson Francois Beukman says input from communities in these areas is key to dealing with gang criminality.
