Former African Nation Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor is set to be cross examined by some implicated persons at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. On Monday, Mentor was questioned by the commission’s legal team on evidence she had presented. Much of her evidence did not correspond
with investigations conducted by the commission. Mentor is back on the witness stand on Tuesday morning; she is expected to wrap up her testimony. There after, she will be cross examined by persons she has implicated in her evidence. Mentor’s evidence will be questioned
by two Hawks officials, Major General Zinhle Mnonopi and Mandla Mtolo. In her previous testimony, Mentor told the commission how a Hawks officer pressured her into removing former president Jacob Zuma’s name from her criminal complaint against the Gupta family. Businessman Fana Hlongwane and Duduzane Zuma will no longer cross examine Mentor. Click on video below:
