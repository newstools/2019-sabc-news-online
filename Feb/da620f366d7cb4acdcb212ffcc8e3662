Concerned Cape Town residents have mobilised to refill a dried-up dam in Brackenfell to benefit local bird species. Most of the ducks and geese moved away when the Wessel Lourens Dam dried up. The Wessel Lourens Dam in Vredekloof is home to dozens of ducks and other water birds. It is also a well-known green belt and park area for residents. Resident Tina Connoway says: “The lack of water forced the animals and ducks to look for water at surrounding houses.” Social media was used to spread the word about efforts to save the dam. On Saturday morning, trucks filled with much-needed borehole water arrived at the dam to the delight of residents and their feathered friends. “It is wonderful to see how the water is arriving. It is so exciting because the dam was completely empty,” says Connoway. Nearly half a million litres of donated water will now ensure that ducks, rabbits and other water birds will enjoy a water-filled home until the arrival of the much-needed winter rains. WATCH BELOW:
