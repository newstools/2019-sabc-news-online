The Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, has denied benefitting from any security upgrades to his properties, as claimed by former Bosasa employee, Richard Le Roux. Le Roux told the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that Mantashe as well as ANC MP Vincent Smith and former SAA Chair, Dudu Myeni, benefitted from the so-called ‘Special Projects’ box. Mantashe was questioned about alleged improvements to his properties while visiting the Total Oil Exploration Drill, about 180km offshore from Mossel Bay. Mantashe says he will be taking journalists to his properties this week so that they can judge for themselves. He says, “I want them to see these security upgrades that are being talked about. I have already written a letter to the commission that I want to give my evidence to the commission. That is where I will give details but I want journalists to go there before I give evidence so that when I give that evidence they can put it in context.” Related Video:
