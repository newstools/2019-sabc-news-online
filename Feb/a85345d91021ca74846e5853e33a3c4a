Parliament’s Communications Committee is meeting on Tuesday to discuss the way forward on the nominations received to fill vacancies on the SABC Board. The committee will also discuss the nominations to fill some of the vacancies in the Media Diversity and Development Agency (MDDA). The committee meeting will take place almost two months after the deadline of SABC board nominations where received in December last year. The committee was initially expected to resume in mid January to start the shortlisting and interviewing process to search for eight non executive SABC board members but delayed. Tuesday’s meeting is expected to give an indication on whether the committee will go ahead and start the shortlisting and interviewing process of candidates or to dissolve the three member board to appoint an interim one in the meantime. The meeting comes just days after Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams announced that she met with a task team which is working on the recapitalisation of the SABC. The Ministry said the team sought to update Ndabeni-Abrahams as she prepares to pursue cabinet’s approval to get a bailout for the SABC.
