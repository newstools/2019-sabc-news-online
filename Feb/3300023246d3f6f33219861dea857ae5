Presidency Spokesperson, Khusela Diko, says the Public Protector should be allowed to finalise an investigation into a R500 000 donation to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s 2017 campaign to be elected as ANC leader. The money was allegedly donated by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has threatened to disrupt Thursday’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) if Ramaphosa doesn’t clear up the issue beforehand. Diko addressed the media on the sidelines of a presidential walk about on the parliamentary precinct. She says, for now, the issue should be left in the hands of the Public Protector. “That is a matter that both DA and EFF have taken to PP. The President has met with the PP, given full statement. Any threat to disrupt is undermining the institutions we have put in place. It would be political opportunism at its best to use this SONA to deal with issues that are being dealt with in other fora,” says Diko.
