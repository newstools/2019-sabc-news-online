Academic activities at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) have resumed. TUT suspended all academic activities at its campuses in Pretoria, Arts, Arcadia, Ga-Rankuwa, eMalahleni and Mbombela due to ongoing student protests. Students are requesting bigger book allowances and for those who have been financially excluded to be allowed back into the institution. TUT spokesperson Willa De Ruyter says the academic programme has been strained due to the protests. “We’ve been monitoring the situation at all our campuses so that academic activities for students can start again. The academic programme has been under a lot of stress and we need to get students back in class.” “As far as the book allowances are concerned, the Minister already made an announcement on Friday that those have been equalised and we are working closely with all the relevant bodies to address all the other issues. As far as the financial exclusions are concerned, we have a financial aid office and students who are affected should go to the financial aid office, sign the agreement of debt and then we will assist them to register.”
