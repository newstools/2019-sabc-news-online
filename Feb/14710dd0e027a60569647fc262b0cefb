The Mangaung metro municipality says it will continue to assist displaced families affected by the recent floods in Bloemfontein. Hundreds of people including children were housed in the municipality hall and some of its buildings after their homes were flooded during last week’s torrential rain in the city. Municipal spokesperon Qondile Khedama says some of the families have started going back to their homes as the weather condition has improved. “The Executive Mayor has opened the number of facilities to assist the displaced people making sure that they get accommodated together with our stakeholders to make sure that we get some food temporarily. But, we have since yesterday some of them have gone back to their houses to take their mattresses outside because the weather was a bit open and hot yesterday. So we hope that the situation will improve by the day because even if you can look today’s weather it’s clear so we are encouraging those that are able to go back and see how best they can assist each other in making sure that they clear their houses,” says Khedama. Meanwhile, police at Beaufort West in the Karoo are investigating the death of a Zimbabwean national after he was swept away by floods near the town. Spokesperson Dawid de Klerk says according to their information, the man, believed to be in his forties, was driving a bakkie with two other passengers on a gravel road about 10 kilometres out of town. He says it appears they were involved in an accident before flood waters swept the bakkie away. One of the passengers managed to escape and called for help. Another passenger was found in the car with slight injuries. De Klerk says the body of the deceased was found on Saturday. Watch related videos below:
