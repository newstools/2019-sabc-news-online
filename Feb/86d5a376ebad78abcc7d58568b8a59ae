Certain sections of the M2 motorway in Johannesburg will be closed from the end of this month until October to allow for bridge rehabilitation. It’s bound to affect thousands of motorists making their way from east to west and north to south of the city. City of Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba and Thomas Chongo who is the Head of Department Planning from the Johannesburg Road Agency (JRA) says that out of 900 bridges only 6% are in good condition. The bridges were built in the early 70’s which are almost 50-years-old. Head of planning at JRA, Thomas Chongo explains that they have became overwhelmed with the backlog of maintenance that needs to be done. “The challenge could be the infrastructure funding required. If you look at the backlog in terms of numbers, we are talking about over 6-billion on the bridges alone.” Click on video below:
