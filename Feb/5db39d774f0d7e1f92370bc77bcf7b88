The Pietermaritzburg High Court has again postponed an application by disgruntled members of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Moses Mabhida region to have the regional task team disbanded. ANC members filed an application at the High Court arguing that the current interim structure’s term of office has lapsed. The Regional Task Team was formed after the dissolution of the Regional Executive Committee in 2018. A number of ANC leaders have been killed in recent years in the Moses Mabhida region. Spokesperson of the disgruntled members Sithebiso Nkuna says they still want the regional conference to be held as soon as possible. “The leadership of the ANC in the PEC level and in the NEC level has denied us the conference unfairly and doing so violating the constitution. This RTT that is in place, we have long said it was fractional, unacceptable over and above this RTT. Its time-frame has lapsed. It lapsed in November because in terms of Constitution, you can only have an interim structure in the REC in a form of RTT for a period if six months only,” says Nkuni. Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal ANC Spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu says the party’s National Executive Committee took a resolution to put on hold conferences of the regions in order to prepare for elections. Simelane Zulu says the current PTT remains in place until the conference takes place. “We are opposing the matter as the ANC on the basis that this is a decision of the National Executive Committee not necessarily a decision of the PEC. So, we as the PEC cannot be compelled by court to go against the decision of the National Executive Committee. The comrades in Moses Mabhda need to engage with the leadership of the African National Congress at national level, but we also need to remember that the decision of the NEC was not a decision that was implicating or directed only to Moses Mabhida Region,” says Zulu.
