Thirteen more bodies have been retrieved from the Gloria Coal Mine in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. More than 20 bodies were reported to be trapped underground following a gas explosion that took place two weeks ago. An unknown number of people are still unaccounted for. It is alleged that the group went underground to steal copper cables. Five bodies were recovered two weeks ago. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says a total of 18 bodies have now been retrieved from underground so far. “A total number of 18 bodies have now been brought to the surface. Today 13, and 2 weeks back 5 bodies were taken out.” “The operation could not continue today because we have got reports from the search and rescue teams that there was a lot of smoke inside the shaft and apparently, they will go back again on Monday.” Related video click below:
