Members of the Wits University Student Representative Council (SRC) are on the second day of a hunger strike. This is part of their protest over student accommodation and registrations. They demand that the university provide students with accommodation and that those who owe the institution R100 000 and less be allowed to register. The Deputy Secretary General of the Student Representative Council Thaakirah Savahl explains. “This hunger strike is also quite symbolic because it speaks to the students who are actually sleeping in the libraries, who don’t have food, who haven’t eaten in a few days. And this is almost as if we are showing sympathy towards them and we are in solidarity with them.” Click on video below
