Former Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, turns 95 years old on Thursday. The former veteran leader stepped down as the president of Zimbabwe after the military and his party ZANU-PF pushed for his resignation in 2017. A small family gathering is expected to take place at the Mugabe residence, “The Blueroof house” in Harare where family members are expected to wish him well. Zimbabweans on social media reacted with mixed feelings, some wishing him well, while others lamented the role he played in bringing the Zimbabwe economy down. This coming Saturday, two functions are lined up –  one with his friends and those still sympathetic to his life, while the ZANU-PF Youth wing will be holding a rally to mobilize support for current President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
