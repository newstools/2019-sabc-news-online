Police are searching for two prisoners who escaped from the high court in Johannesburg. The court has been evacuated as police continue with their search. It’s not clear at this stage how the prisoners managed to flee. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the inmates had just been brought into the court from prison. “At the moment police are still investigating to determine how the suspects escaped. At the moment what we got is that only two suspects escaped. The people are outside so that we can do a thorough investigation.”
