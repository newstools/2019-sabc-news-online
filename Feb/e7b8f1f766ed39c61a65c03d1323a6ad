Schooling has resumed at Shaleng village near Taung in the North West, after four weeks of disruptions. Community protests have prevented them from attending school. Demands include a road, a new school and RDP houses. A grade 11 pupil, 19-year-old Olibile Arone, says that they are concerned about falling behind. “It’s about four weeks since we’ve been at home. We only went to school for two weeks. We are worried about our work of term one.” The North West Education Department has pleaded with the community to stop disrupting learning. The community has agreed on condition that two new schools are built in Shaleng. John Semeri, school principal, says a priority for the school is making up for lost schooling. “School normally starts at 07:30 and ends at 14:30 but we will extend the times. School will start at 07:00 until 17:30 so children can have extra classes.” Residents say they are tired of voting and not receiving services. “We don’t have roads, schools, water and a clinic. That’s why the community took the decision of stopping children from going to school,” says a resident. “The community is tired of voting. That’s why they’ve taken the decision not to vote unless their problems are being heard by government. We are complaining about roads infrastructure.” The community has threatened to disrupt schooling again if its call is ignored.
