The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Studentsâ€™ Command would like to extend condolences to the family and members of Durban University of Technology (DUT) EFFSC on the passing of a DUT Student and member of the EFFSC branch. The student was shot dead during the student mass meeting at DUT demanding Free Registration and Free Education ultimately. He sadly becomes the 2nd student after Katlego Monareng of TUT Soshanguve to die in the brutal hands of private security and police brutality on campus for fighting for students genuinely. The EFF Student Command calls for the University, Department of Higher Education and the private security provider to account for the passing away of the student.
