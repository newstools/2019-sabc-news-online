Deputy President David Mabuza has dismissed the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) claims that Minister Pravin Gordhan is the one who acts as deputy president in the country. EFF Member of Parliament Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi told Mabuza that Gordhan was acting like a de facto deputy president who has taken over Mabuza’s powers. She was speaking in the National Assembly during Mabuza’s oral reply session. “He is and he believes that he is untouchable. It makes him believe that he is a de facto Deputy President undermining you; doing as he pleases, and purging qualified black engineers from Eskom. What are you going to do to make sure that Pravin Gordhan and others like him account to Parliament? And what do you make about the perception out there that Minister Pravin Gordhan in fact has taken your powers as the Deputy President?” Mabuza dismissed Mkhaliphi’s claims as unfounded. “On the question of Minister Pravin acting as the Deputy President, I think it’s incorrect. I am the Deputy President until otherwise. And when I look at Minister Pravin, he does not have any appetite to become the Deputy President.”
