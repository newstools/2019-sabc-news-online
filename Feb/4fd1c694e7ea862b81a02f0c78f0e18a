The trial of the controversial pastor of the Jesus Dominion International Church, Timothy Omotoso, and two co-accused has been postponed to April 16 this year in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. The suspects are facing more than 90 charges related to sexual crimes and human trafficking. Omotoso’s defence team has petitioned the Constitutional Court to hear an application to have the judge in the matter recused. The team blames judge Mandela Makaula of being biased. The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed the application by Omotoso’s legal team to have presiding Judge Makaula recuse himself. It dismissed the application on the grounds that it has no prospect of success. The defence wants Makaula to recuse himself, and the charges against their clients quashed claiming undue bias. Several witnesses are yet to take to the stand.
