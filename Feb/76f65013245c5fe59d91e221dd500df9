Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, has expressed concern about South Africa’s porous borders. Maimane says the country’s resources are not being allocated properly to ensure the borders are properly policed. He says the blame lies with the Department of Home Affairs. Political parties have been on the campaign trail this weekend ahead of the May 8th general elections. Maimane was addressing party members and supporters at the Makhuvha stadium outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. “There’s no country which can sustain itself when the border control doesn’t exist. Let’s secure our borders, let’s make sure that everybody is registered, let’s ensure that Home Affairs can make sure that citizens and non citizens are registered properly so that we can allocate resources properly. At this point in time it’s an open border system that ensures that there’s no accountability from anybody.”
