Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha says the construction of the High Court in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, is almost complete. He says this is despite a few challenges related to access to the court. Masutha met with stakeholders involved in the project in Mbombela earlier on Thursday to monitor progress made so far. The construction of the High Court has cost government over R900 million from the initial budget of R600 million; R300 million over budget. Masutha says additional costs will push the budget to over R1 billion. Masuthu says discussions aimed at addressing the existing challenges are at an advance stage. “Within the next three weeks more or less we should have reach this critical stage where most of the stumbling block shall have been removed. The project has taken quite sometimes has suffered many setbacks in-terms of the finalisation, not just of the construction from the building itself but other aspects such as access to the court.” The court precinct has one access road and Masutha says it needs another access road. “We are finalising negotiation with the TVET college on the access road issue and certain conditions in place where we don’t think they are a big problem.” Judge President of Mpumalanga High Court, Judge Francis Legodi, says this is a major relief to the provincial justice system. “It’s going to help because we will have more courts in operation, and two will have more judges and the personnel that will be helping judges.” Until the opening, High Court matters will still be temporarily heard at the Nelspruit and Middelburg Magistrate’s Court.
