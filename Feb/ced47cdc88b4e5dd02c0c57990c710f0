The African National Congress national leadership says the only recognised structure of the party in the North West, is the Provincial Task Team (PTT). The PTT, led by Premier Job Mokgoro, was appointed to run the province by the party’s national leadership last year. This is after the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC), led by former Premier Supra Mahumapelo was disbanded. Currently there seems to be a leadership battle within the province, as both the PTT and the PEC are adamant to be running the party’s affairs in the province. This follows the ruling of the Johannesburg High Court that declared the disbandment of the PEC un-procedural and ordered its immediate reinstatement. ANC acting national spokesperson, Dakota Legoete, says they recognise the PTT, as they have appealed both the ruling and the order. “The structure that we are recognising in line with the appeal that we have made is the Provincial Task Team. You would know that in terms of the court rules particularly Section 80 of the relevant Act, once an appeal has been made it means the execution of the court order is set aside.” However, Legoete further says as the party national leadership, they are engaging both the PTT and the disbanded PEC to find a political solution on the matter.
