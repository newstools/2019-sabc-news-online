Lawyers for controversial Nigerian pastor, Timothy Omotoso have indicated that they will bring a new application in his case in the Port Elizabeth High Court. SABC News has reliably learnt that the judge has shares in one of the accommodation establishments which is used by witnesses in this case. The trial, which started last year has been postponed to the 16th of April. Omotoso and his two co-accused face more than 90 sex-related charges. There is presently an appeal to the Constitutional Court calling for Judge Makaula to recuse himself as defence lawyer Peter Daubermann blames him for being biased towards first witness, Cheryl Zondi. Itâ€™s believed that the defence will bring evidence that witnesses stayed at a guest house, linked to Judge Makaula. Spokesperson for the office of the chief justice, Nathi Mncube has confirmed that they are aware of these allegations relating to shareholding in a guesthouse. He explained that an independent service provider places witnesses, after an administration process by the NPA. Related Video:
