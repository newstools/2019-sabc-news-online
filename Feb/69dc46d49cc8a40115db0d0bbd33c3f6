President Cyril Ramaphosa is about to deliver the State of the Nation Address at 7 o’clock. It is expected that he will speak about corruption. Various political parties represented in Parliament have said that they hope Ramaphosa will tackle the issue on the backdrop of recent revelations made at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. “ I think that have been taken thus are steps in the right direction- now those steps that have been taken need to be implemented in terms of prosecution of those people that have been implicated,” says  United Democratic Movement Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Nkwankwa. Various political parties represented in parliament said they hope Rampahosa will tackle the issue on the backdrop of recent revelations made at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The Freedom Front Plus says while it is good to see those implicated in State Capture being arrested, politicians should not be untouchable. Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenwald says more arrests should follow. “Yesterday (Wednesday) there were some arrests made in so far as the correctional services are concerned, but really is this a window dressing? Or are we serious? What about the politicians? UDM Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Nkwankwa says, “I think that have been taken thus are steps in the right direction – now those steps that have been taken need to be implemented in terms of prosecution of those people that have been implicated.”
