Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane will lead a picket to the Free State Premier’s Office to hand over a memorandum demanding the provincial government take immediate action against municipalities in the province, which have failed to pay Eskom their bills. The top two worst offenders at the end of last year were Maluti A Phofung and Matjhabeng, who owe Eskom over R2 billion and more than R1 billion respectively. Eskom is in R419 billion debt and reportedly has only two months left before being declared bankrupt. Maluti A Phofung and Matjhabeng municipality has seen a series of violent protests over service delivery, which include electricity. The Goldfields area has also been challenged by illegal miners who have tampered with electricity. The DA alleges that the two municipalities are in a dire state due to corrupt officials.
