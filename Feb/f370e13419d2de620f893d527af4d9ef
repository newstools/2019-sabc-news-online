The Anti-Racism Network South Africa has launched the fourth Anti-Racism Week for this year at the Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg. The launch, which was attended by a number of social activists, is aimed at building a movement to campaign for an end to racism in South Africa. Anti-Racism week is held annually from March the 14th to the 21st. The aim is to create awareness about racism and how it affects society. Anti-Racism Manager for the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Busisiwe Nkosi, says the foundation will take younger people to Sharpville during Anti-Racism week. “These will be 40 young people from different race groups and we just want them to understand the history of South Africa number one, but also to be able to talk to each other about that they are facing as young people. We’ll be taking young people to the Holocaust and Genocide Centre as well for a tour for them to also understand what happened and what was Genocide in Rwanda and all of that and at the same time we’ll be visiting schools.”
