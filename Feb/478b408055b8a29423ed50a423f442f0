ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule says the African National Congress upholds the principle of innocent until proven guilty with regards to the respective cases of party spokespersons Pule Mabe and Zizi Kodwa. The party earlier confirmed that Mabe and Kodwa have agreed to step aside amid allegations of sexual harassment and rape respectively. Magashule says the ANC does not want to judge anybody. He says: “A person is innocent until proven otherwise, but also those who made the allegations might have a case, we don’t know that’s why we are saying law enforcement are there.” “With Pule Mabe, it was a matter of the employer-employee relationship. With Zizi, it’s something which happened outside the employment area and that Zizi himself volunteered to say let me also step aside lets deal with these matters. We think some of these matters are fabricated. There is an agenda, what we don’t know is who is driving this agenda – we don’t know.” Related Video
