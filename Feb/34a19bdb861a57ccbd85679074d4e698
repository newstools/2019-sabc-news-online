Hundreds of flamingo chicks that were rescued from the Northern Cape’s Kamfers Dam will be micro-chipped in an effort to track and manage their movements. The chicks and eggs were abandoned by lesser flamingos that left the Kimberley Wetland which is rapidly drying up. Volunteers rescued the chicklings, which were later flown to bird rehabilitation centres in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. An ornithologist (bird expert) will be dispatched to the dam to monitor the situation. Provincial spokesperson for the Department of Environment and Nature Conservation, Lesego Pule explains, “This is an effort by all key stakeholders including our sister Department of Environmental Affairs, who have resources that we don’t have. They are going to send a bird scientist this week that is going to assess the situation further. The tagging and tracking will happen as soon as the birds are matured. This will be a first for flamingos in the Northern Cape were the chicks are hand raised to a point that they are matured. We want to have information about these hand raised flamingos once they are grown.” Click on videos below
