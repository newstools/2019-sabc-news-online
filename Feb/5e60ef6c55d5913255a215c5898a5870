The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) says it does not think President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s approach to unbundle Eskom into three independent entities is the correct solution. IFP Chief Whip Narend Singh says the issue of Eskom can be better handled by all stakeholders including government, labour unions, civil society groups and Eskom management. “The unbundling might be just the shifting of the beats on the chess board and it will [add] to more bureaucracy we think. We really need to get to the root of solving Eskom without getting to these measures. I think it is going to require a lot of working together with labour, government and Eskom management and see how we can get the matter of Eskom resolved,” adds Singh.
