The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has praised citizens for calling out racist comments by the Black Land First spokesperson, Lindsay Maasdorp over the Hoërskool Driehoek tragedy. A fourth learner has died in ICU and has been identified as sixteen-year-old Marnus Nagel. He was one of twenty-three learners hospitalised after a walkway at the school collapsed on Friday. Maasdorp earlier came out in support of a comment by a Facebook user Siyanda Gumede who said he does not feel pain for the learners who lost their lives in the tragedy, who Gumede assumed to be white. Foundation spokesperson, Zaakirah Vadi, says that the community must continue to express outrage over racism. “I think we must also commend the public who took to social media to express their outrage at the comments that were expressed. We think it’s essential that the community continues to express its voice of outrage against racism in the country. This is not the first time the BLF is accused of making such statements.”
