Former cabinet minister Siphiwe Nyanda has concluded his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Earlier, he spoke of rumours that were circulating among African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee members on an impending cabinet reshuffle that would affect him. He says the rumours were started by NEC members that had been called to the Gupta compound in Saxonwold. Nyanda says the Guptas had apparently told the same NEC members that they would be appointed cabinet ministers. Nyanda echoed what former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the Commission earlier that ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula was among those that the Guptas told that he would be appointed as Sports and Recreation Minister. Manuel told the commission that the extent at which state capture had impacted the daily running of government needed urgent intervention from the country’s judicial system. Manuel said he found himself being declared a “free agent” just for speaking out against state capture. Watch for more for more on the story:
