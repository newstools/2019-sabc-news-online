The DA has been barred from inspecting Hoerskool Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg, after hearing that it is another disaster waiting to happen. The party visited the school on Wednesday to conduct an oversight visit after teacher union, SAOU, revealed that a total of 18 classrooms are not being used at the school due to their extreme state of dilapidation. The union says an engineering company, employed by the school, found that the classroom floors had sagged and there were visible cracks on the reinforced concrete floors. This comes in the wake of a walkway collapse at Hoerskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, which left four learners dead. The DA’s Khume Ramulifho says they’ve been receiving a lot of complaints from parents who’re concerned about the safety of their children. “Unfortunately the school told us that they’ve got a directive from the department that we should not be allowed to do an inspection, or conduct an oversight, which is surprising because it’s a new phenomenon. We were told that there are about 18 classes which are not being used because they’re considered not to be safe. That’s why we came to verify whether it’s true or not. So the department should not hide, they just need to come open because parents are not sure whether their kids are safe. Yesterday we even visited another school in Lenasia, we were told the same that we can’t conduct our oversight.”
