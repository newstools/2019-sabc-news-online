Former President Thabo Mbeki says former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo will be key to the country’s healing and reconciliation process. Mbeki says any process in the country that excludes Gbabgo is doomed to fail and may eventually lead the country to another civil war. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague acquitted Gbabgo of crimes against humanity charges in January. He is currently in Belgium. Mbeki spoke to the SABC on the sidelines of the just-ended African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. “If this matter is not addressed in Côte d’Ivoire – the matter of reconciliation and national unity – one day that civil war will resume and many people will be killed.” Click below for more on the AU:
