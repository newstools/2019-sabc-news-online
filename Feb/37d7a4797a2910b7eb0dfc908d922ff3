Wits University says the student protests at its Braamfontein campus in Johannesburg have been called off following an agreement between management and students Thursday night. Students have been protesting since Monday demanding that the University provide them with accommodation and that students with historical debt of R100 000 and less be allowed to register. Some of the classes were cancelled on Thursday and are expected to resume on Friday morning. Wits University spokesperson, Shirona Patel says, “There are no protests happening at Wits today. All academic programmes scheduled for Friday will go ahead as normal as well as all university activities.”
