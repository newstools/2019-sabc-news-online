A trust fund has been set up for the 20 plus learners who were injured in the Hoërskool Driehoek tragedy earlier in February in the Vaal. One of the school’s walkways collapsed, resulting in the deaths of four learners. The trust fund will assist with hospital bills and other medical expenses for learners who are still in recovery. An event drive is underway to ensure continued medical treatment for learners who need it. “The idea behind today’s (Sunday) event was … we realized that kids got hurt at the end of the day and medical expenses don’t come cheap. So, we decided to have a little get-together here, have a fundraiser for the kids. We started up a trust fund. Any money that will be collected will be paid into the trust fund. So, if there’s a kid that needs medical attention or wheelchairs or crutches or whatever the case might be, we can cover that for them out of the trust fund,” says one of the organisers David Koln.
