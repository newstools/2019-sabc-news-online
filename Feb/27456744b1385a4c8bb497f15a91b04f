Fourteen civilians were killed in a jihadist attack in northern Burkina Faso near the Mali border, the military said on Monday. The army conducted raids in three northern provinces in response and said it had neutralised 146 militants. The jihadist attack, which took place in the town of Kain in the Yatenta province bordering Mali, is one of the most serious recorded in the country. “On the night of Sunday 3 to Monday, February 4, 2019 a terrorist attack in Kain left 14 civilian victims. In response to this attack, the national defence and security forces immediately began operations in the Kain, Banh and Bomboro areas. This counterattack…resulted in a land and air operation which neutralised 146 terrorists in the three areas,” says Colonel Lamoussa Fofana, Army spokesperson. A military source confirmed that the term “neutralise” meant kill. The death toll from jihadist attacks has now risen to nearly 300 since 2015. The killings occurred on the eve of the G5 Sahel summit to be held in Ouagadougou on Tuesday.
