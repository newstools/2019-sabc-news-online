The African National Congress (ANC) has conceded that what is happening in the party in the North West is embarrassing. The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) has confirmed that it has approached the High Court in Johannesburg to seek leave to appeal its ruling that the party’s North West Provincial Executive Committee be reinstated. The court made the ruling last week after the ANC NEC disbanded the PEC which was led by former ANC provincial chairperson Supra Mahumapelo last year. Acting ANC national spokesperson, Dakota Legoete, says it would be better to settle such matters out of court. “When we deal with matters through a political solution, it’s far better than dealing with them through the courts because sometimes the courts make their decisions which have an over-reach. It creates unnecessary problems. But as the ANC we remain committed to the rule of law. We would respect the authority of the court.” WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
