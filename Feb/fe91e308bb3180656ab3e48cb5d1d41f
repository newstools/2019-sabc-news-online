Suspended Deputy Director of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba, has lambasted the evidence of advocates Willie Hofmeyr and Glynnis Breytenbach, who questioned her integrity and fitness to manage the NPA. Jiba made the remarks at the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria before presenting her evidence in chief. She labelled Breytenbach and Hofmeyr’s attitudes as that of colleagues who never imagined being led by a black woman in their careers. Jiba and Mrwebi are being probed for their fitness to hold office, following allegations of mishandling high profile corruption cases. She says the current situation has had ripple effects in her legal career of 27 years and personal life. In 2012, former KwaZulu-Natal Head of the Hawks Major General Johan Booysen and more than 20 others from the now disbanded Cato Manor Serious and Violent Crimes Unit were arrested, following articles which the paper alleged they’d been operating a ‘death squad’. In her testimony on Thursday, Jiba spoke on the criticism she received by Judge Trevor Govern over the lack of evidence placed before him regarding her decision to prosecute Booysen. Jiba says the affidavit gave a summary of the evidence.
