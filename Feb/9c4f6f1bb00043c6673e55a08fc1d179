Former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Johan Booysen says he did not voluntarily resign from the South African Police Service (SAPS). Boysens is testifying before the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria. The enquiry has assured Booysen whose pending 2012 racketeering case is yet to be finalised in court that it will not make any findings in the case. He is the 13th witness to appear before the Enquiry which is probing into fitness of the suspended National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) senior advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to hold office. Booysen, whose career with the police spans over 40 years, testified that he was offered a golden hand shake to leave his job as KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head in February 2016, prior to officially scheduled retirement. Evidence leader, Nazreen Bawa, questioned what happened before Booysen left his job. Click below to watch the live streamâ€¦.
