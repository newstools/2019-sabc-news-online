Preparations for the official opening of Parliament for 2019 are at an advanced stage. On Tuesday and on Wednesday both the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and the South African Police Service (SAPS) will undertake their final rehearsals. The National Assembly maintains that the only agenda item will be President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address. Several roads in the Cape Town CDB will be temporarily closed leading to Thursday. National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson, Thandi Modise says there is no Question and Answer session scheduled on the day and no extraordinary security measures have been put in place.   She also says they have cut down on the cost of the event this year. “We are indeed ready, no extra ordinary measures have been taken. The joint rules are known. They are printed they are out there – we will apply them. Well, the economy of the country is not doing so well, the economy of the world is not doing so well, there is no way we could continue spending like there is no tomorrow,” adds the NCOP chairperson. “We have cut off the elaborate digital and the posters on the lampposts of Cape Town. There is no longer a dinner. We have cut down on the number of invitees, so we have cut down on those costs and that remarkably brings down our costs,” explains Modise.
