 The United States Tuesday slammed police repression in Zimbabwe, weeks after security forces crushed protests there. Washington also urged all parties to take part in the national dialogue that  opposition forces have sat out. State Department
spokesman Robert Palladino stressed US concern over “excessive use of
force” by the government since country-wide protests have escalated
against the doubling of fuel prices. He said the
crackdown had left at least “13 dead, 600 victims of violence, torture or
rape, and more than 1,000 arrests.” “The
Government of Zimbabwe’s use of violence against civil society and imposition
of undue internet restrictions betray promises to create a new Zimbabwe,”
Palladino said. And the United
States urges all parties to come together immediately in national dialogue. “The dialogue
process must be credible, inclusive, and mediated by a neutral third
party,” he stressed. Police arrested
more than 1,100 people, including leading trade unionists, lawmakers from
Chamisa’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and some children in last
month’s violent protests.
