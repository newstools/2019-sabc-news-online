Labour union Nehawu has vowed to intensify its strike action at Technical and Vocational Education and Training(TVET) and community training colleges across the country. This after a meeting between Nehawu, student organisations, the Ministers of Higher Education and Labour collapsed on Thursday. Nehawu says Minister Naledi Pandor allegedly refused to heed their request to excuse Higher Education Director General Gwebinkundla Qonde from the meeting. Nehawu says Qonde is the reason workers are on strike. Nehawu’s Secretary General Zola Saphetha says: “We are meeting over this weekend to focus on what needs to be done. We are quite clear that we must intensify and part of the intensification program – we’ll have to speak to other components under the Higher Education and Training such as members in the office of the Minister and members in Parliament to join the strike including our members in university. This is a war that cannot be lost.”
