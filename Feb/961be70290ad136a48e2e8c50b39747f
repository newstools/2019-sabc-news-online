Eskom has announced the implementation of Stage-three load shedding nationwide from 8am on Tuesday until 11pm. The power utility says although seven generating units that went offline Monday, they are now producing power, but diesel and water reserves are still very low resulting in the need for load shedding. Stage-3 load shedding calls for 3000 megawatts to be shed from the grid nationally. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says the power grid remains constrained. “Things are not looking good; the biggest thing that we are experiencing [is] a lot of breakdowns at our power stations. You have even new ones like Medupi and Kusile power stations also breaking down in addition to the old ones.” “The old ones I suppose there’s some expectation that some of these things could happen because some of these power stations were built in the 60s [and] they need a lot of maintenance. They need a lot of tender care … it is very unfortunate that we are having to go through load shedding at this stage,” explains Phasiwe. Click related video below:
