The African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa is starting his two-day visit in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, to launch the provincial leg of the ANC manifesto. He will start his engagements by addressing the traditional and religious leaders before a gala dinner on Friday night. On Saturday, he will address a rally at the Thohoyandou stadium. Many people in and around Thohoyandou are anticipating to meet President Ramaphosa when he launches the provincial leg of the ANC manifesto despite the continuing rainy conditions. After the rally on Saturday, President Ramaphosa will visit the bereaved families of the late South African Municipal Workers’ Union senior officials, Ronald Mani and Timmy Musetsho who were gunned down few weeks ago. Mani and Musetsho were shot and killed by unknown killers for being vocal against the municipal authorities who took public funds meant for service delivery to the now liquidated mutual bank, VBS.
