The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to scrap the e-toll system in the province. In an open letter to the President, the provincial ANC says it is disappointed that the issue was not addressed in last week’s State of the Nation Address. It says last year’s People’s March to the Union Buildings sent a clear message to the president’s office that the people of Gauteng want the scrapping of e-tolls in the province. ANC provincial Secretary, Jacob Khawe says, “We no longer want e-tolls in Gauteng. …. E-tolls in its current form today it has been part of a burden and… the cost of living we want e-tolls to be scrapped. And we as the ANC do have a few proposals to make to the President about how best we can use the gantries of e-tolls, but how best can we pay the debt and move forward without e-tolls in Gauteng.” Watch related videos below for more on the story:
