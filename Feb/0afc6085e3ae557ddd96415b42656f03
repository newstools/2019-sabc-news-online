Male students must play their part in curbing unplanned pregnancies. That’s the call made during the launch of a Family planning drive in KwaZulu Natal. The campaign comes just a week after a new born baby was found dumped inside a storm water drain in Newlands, west of Durban. The drive also coincides with National Condom Awareness Week. Many women bear the responsibility of family planning. But the recent images of a newborn baby found abandoned inside a storm water drain in Durban have made an impact on some men. “It changed my life in many ways. I had to give up a lot of my dreams so I can provide for my son.” Young fathers have called for more awareness of reproductive education among their peers. “That’s why you find that most parents are single parents because we say family planning is for girls. But we need to be in partnership with the girls in doing family planning in order to make the future of our children greater.” Authorities say condoms remain the most effective method of preventing unwanted pregnancies. “For males, we have family planning which is largely condom use. There is one that we advocate for older men where you do vasectomy. But that one is completely irreversible. You are saying you will not make any other person pregnant anytime,” says KZN Health MEC, Sibongiseni Dhlomo. Dhlomo also urged males to not shy away from their responsibilities saying their efforts will go a long way towards
solving the problem.
