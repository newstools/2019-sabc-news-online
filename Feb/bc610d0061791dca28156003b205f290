Eastern Cape Transport MEC, Weziwe Tikana and Sanral representatives have been meeting with the Ingquza Hill Traditional Authorities to discuss the thorny issue of the N2 Wild Coast Development. Some communities in the Pondoland have been resisting attempts to build the road through the pristine area. They’ve filed papers in the Pretoria High Court seeking the court to set aside Sanral’s authorisation to build the road. They fear it will open the road for the titanium mine in Xolobeni. Transport spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, “The meeting is mainly to speak to our people about the project and ensure that they work towards its success. Traditional leaders are here, representatives from Sanral and businesses are also here to listen in and ensure that they have their input in this meeting. We’re hoping that by the end of this meeting we would have found lasting solutions and ensure that this project is the success that it ought to be.”
