One of the four victims of the Hoërskool Driehoek tragedy will be buried on Thursday. Grade eight pupil Jandre Steyn’s funeral service will be held later on Thursday in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal. Steyn is one of the four learners who
died when a cement walkway linking two buildings at his school collapsed
trapping a number of learners underneath. More than twenty others sustained injuries. The other victims, Marli Currie, Manus Nagel and Roydon Olckers, will be laid to rest on Friday. The school has since been closed and is expected to reopen on Monday next week. Click on video below
