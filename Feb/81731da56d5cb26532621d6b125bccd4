Eskom Head of Risk and Sustainability and acting Head of Generation Andrew Etzinger says they will be implementing Stage 2 rotational load-shedding from nine o’clock on Monday morning. The power utility says this is as a result of a shortage
of capacity due to a number of generating units still out of service due to
breakdowns. On Sunday, Eskom implemented stage 2 rotational load-shedding across the country. According to the struggling power utility, this is “as a result of a shortage of capacity”. Etzinger says: “Our engineers are working on it. We still need to finish our pump storage, upper dam levels as well as our gas turbine diesel.” “So unfortunately for at least today it looks like a continuation of load shedding.” Full interview click audio below: Click video below:
