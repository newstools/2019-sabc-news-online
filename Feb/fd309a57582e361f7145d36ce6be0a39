Security arrangements around
Parliament have once again provoked criticism from residents. Several roads in the Cape Town CBD have been cordoned off in preparation for Thursday’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) in Parliament. There is a heavy police presence in the area. Security on the day of the opening of Parliament is a nightmare for citizens. Some say it is a major inconvenience. “I just came here
(Cape Town), I didn’t know the roads would be closed, I was here for this shop,
unfortunately it is closed, there is a lack of communication,” says one of the
people. Another resident says;  “ I was supposed to be in court and I  never got parking,  it is really an issue they obviously need to
take security measures, however there are quite a lot of resources out here, so
the extent, the amount of police out here, they could tone that down a bit.” Others are more understanding about what is happening around Parliament. “Well, I guess they know what they are doing, so maybe we shouldn’t 
complain. I don’t really have that much of a problem with it. Security 
is security and it must be done.” Earlier this week, Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli, asked for citizens to be tolerant of the arrangements. “All security can go
with some slight inconvenience, precisely because it is security. It would be
ridiculous not to make proper security arrangements that will unfortunately
cause some inconvenience but it is meant only for that time.” Roads around Parliament
will be closed until just before Thursday midnight.
