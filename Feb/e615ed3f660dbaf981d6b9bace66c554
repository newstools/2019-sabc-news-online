Eskom has confirmed there won’t be any loadshedding on Monday. Last week the country was plunged into darkness after the power utility lost some of its electricity generating units due to breakdowns. Acting head of Generation at the Power Utility Andrew Etzinger says, “At the moment the situation is looking good. Our plant performance has continued to improve so at this stage no loadshedding expected.” “As for rest of the week we hoping that the situation stays as it is for the moment, if we do see a change we will certainly come back to the public through the media or other communication channels but we off to a good start,” explains Etzinger.
