The Durban University of Technology (DUT) Students’ Representative Council (SRC) has handed a memorandum of demands to an official from the eThekwini Municipality outside the City Hall. In the memorandum, students are demanding the immediate arrest of a security guard who allegedly killed 20 year-old student Mlungisi Madonsela. They also want the security company and university management be prosecuted. Students marched from the university’s Steve Biko Campus to the City Hall after demonstrating at the office of the Vice-Chancellor. Municipality’s Mayoral Political Advisor Mlungisi Mtombela received the memorandum. “We are receiving this memorandum on behalf of the mayor who is not here now. She just left for a PEC meeting. We will then act as we are told. We will then send it to the office of the premier and the office of the MEC for Safety and Liaison and then to the NPA as well. We are hoping that it will reach the president of the Republic of SA through the premier.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
