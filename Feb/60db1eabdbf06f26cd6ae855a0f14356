The African National Congress (ANC) in Eastern Cape says it will set up a dedicated unit to monitor and assess the performance of its deployees in government every three months. This emerged at the party’s provincial lekgotla in East London. The party says the unit will be based at the ANC headquarters at Calata House in King William’s Town. It has vowed to ensure that all cadres are deployed in appropriate positions and that those who do not perform are removed. Provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukaitobi says, “There’s already a format that we have designed that will deal with specific areas of deployment. But for individuals that are deployed, we are going to do an assessment once every three months.” “The purpose of that performance appraisal is to do two things, [firstly is] to find if cadres that are deployed are appropriately deployed and [secondly is to] give support where it is necessary. We cannot continue with comrades that are unable to discharge because of their deficiencies.” Click below for ANC related videos….
