National Treasury official Catherine MacLeod is expected to give testimony when the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture resumes in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Tuesday morning. On Monday, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo ruled that the application for leave to cross-examine former National Treasury Director-General, Lungisa Fuzile, would only be granted once former finance minister and African National Congress (ANC) MP Des van Rooyen’s legal team submits a supplementary affidavit.   Former President Jacob Zuma appointed Van Rooyen as finance minister after axing Nhlanhla Nene in 2015. Van Rooyen only lasted three days in the portfolio after which Pravin Gordhan replaced him. The move is estimated to have cost the South African economy over R500 billion. On Monday, Fuzile said Zuma was dissatisfied with his handling of the nuclear procurement project, PetroSA, matters relating to South African Airways (SAA), the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grant contract, the closure of the Gupta bank accounts and the Denel-Asia matter. Fuzile said the former President told him that finance ministers in other countries don’t tell the President that there is no money, they simply find it. The commission is expected to also deal with matters relating to Eskom during the course of this week. WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
