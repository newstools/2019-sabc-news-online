National Health Education & Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) has called on all its members in the higher education sector to return to work. This comes after the union and the Higher Education Department reached an agreement that ended a nationwide strike at TVET and Community Education and Training Colleges. Nehawu’s national spokesperson, Khaya Xaba, says they will closely monitor the department to ensure that it sticks to its part of the agreement. He says: “We call off the strike and urge all workers including our members to return to work. No worker must not be at work.” “If they are not back, then the principal or the department will have to deal with that.” Related Video
