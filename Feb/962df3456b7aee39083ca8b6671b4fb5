Eskom‘s representation to the National Energy Regulator (Nersa) on tariff increases has been met with a heavy backlash. The power utility is proposing a 15% tariff increase over three years amidst worsening financial woes. Its Chief Financial Officer, Caleb Cassim says Eskom is in a dire situation and is using one credit card to pay its debt on another. Nersa has accused Eskom of providing misrepresented information. Various stakeholders are expected to make representations at the tariff hearing this week. The National Union of Metal Workers (Numsa) last week staged a picket outside Soweto where Nersa was holding public hearings.  The union also made submissions to the Nersa board on why Eskom should be denied further tariff hikes.  Click below for more on the story:
