South Africa will deposit its instruments of ratification of
the African Free Continental Trade Area in Addis Ababa, on the side-lines of
the African Union Summit. Five other countries including Senegal, Sierra Leonne,
Republic of Congo, Mauritius will also deposit their instruments. This will bring to 17 the number of countries that have
ratified the agreement. For the agreement to take effect, a minimum of 22 countries
must ratify the agreement. Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies says this will create

outline where finances will come from to unbundle Eskom and to establish a
directorate within the National Prosecuting Authority to deal with systematic
corruption. Click below for moreâ€¦
