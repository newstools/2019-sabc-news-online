Former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has concluded testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Earlier, he told the commission that the extent at which state capture has impacted the daily running of government needs urgent intervention from the country’s judicial system. Manuel says he found himself being declared a “free agent” just for speaking out against state capture. He has described how African National Congress (ANC) member Fikile Mbalula was emotional at an National Executive Committee meeting in August 2011. This is after he was informed by the Gupta family that he would become the Minister of Sport and Recreation. Manuel says Mbalula was excited and yet puzzled to have heard the news from the Guptas and not from the then president, Jacob Zuma. Former Cabinet Minister, Siphiwe Nyanda is expected to take the stand after lunch. Click below for more on the story:
