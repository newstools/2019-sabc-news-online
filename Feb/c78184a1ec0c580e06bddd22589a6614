More witnesses are expected to testify before the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria on Friday morning. Ten witnesses, mostly National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) senior officials, have already testified. The enquiry is probing the fitness of suspended senior advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to hold office. On Thursday, head of the Asset Forfeiture Unit in the NPA Advocate Willie Hofmeyer told the enquiry that the NDPP and the NPA were marred by political pressure and intimidation of staff under the leadership of Jiba and Morwebi. He questioned their ability to hold office. “I have issues of competency in the fact that they’re the most senior advocates in the NPA and the fact that they assisted Mdluli shows they have no regard for law and for me it’s a serious concern; especially to work with people in the organisation who were either spying to give information to people or sabotage in various ways,” Hofmeyer said.
