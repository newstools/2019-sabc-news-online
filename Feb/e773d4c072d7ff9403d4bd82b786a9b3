A jet from Khalifa Haftar’s east Libyan military forces
intercepted a civilian plane on Sunday as part of its push to control the
oil-rich south of the riven nation, the faction said. Libya has been in turmoil since the NATO-backed toppling of
Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with parallel administrations and armed groups carving
the nation into swathes of control. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) began an offensive in
the south last month to fight militants and take control of oil installations,
and this week banned flights without its permission. In a statement, the LNA said it scrambled a jet after a
plane took off from the El Feel oilfield without permission, and forced it to
land near Sabha, the largest town in south Libya. It was allowed to continue to Tripoli, seat of the
internationally-recognised government, after inspection. The Tripoli government protested against the interception,
saying the Libyan Airlines plane was carrying oil workers. The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the
eastern city of Benghazi, wants to secure the El Sharara oilfield, Libya’s
largest, and occupied a pumping station 20km (12 miles) away on Wednesday,
according to a field engineer. The Tripoli government, striving to reassert its former
control of El Sharara, has sent troops there, a source from the administration
said. El Sharara has been shut since December when local tribesmen
and state guards seized it.
