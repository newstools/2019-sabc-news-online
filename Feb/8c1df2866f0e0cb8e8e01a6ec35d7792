The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) has urged traditional leaders to work with the party to return the land to the people. PAC President Narius Moloto made the call during the launch of the party’s 2019 election manifesto in Johannesburg. The party’s manifesto focuses on returning land to the people, fighting crime and developing rural areas. It also says nurses, soldiers and the police will not pay tax if the PAC wins the elections. The party says it will work on becoming more relevant in South Africa. It says it is convinced that it is following the footsteps of the founding fathers of the PAC. Moloto has been speaking during the launch of the party’s 2019 election manifesto in Johannesburg. The party is currently embroiled in political infighting. It has two factions with one of them being led by Mzwanele Nyhotsho. The IEC has ordered both factions to find an urgent solution failing which none will be recognised during elections. Moloto says they have to instil discipline in the party. “The PAC will continue to clean itself so that it can also become relevant into the current political situation in the country. We could not continue to run the PAC being surrounded by in-discipline and ill-discipline elements that always refuse and defy the direction that the party is taking.” Related video click below:
