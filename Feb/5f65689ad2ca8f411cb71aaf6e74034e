Thursday marks the first year since Jacob Zuma announced his resignation as the President of South Africa. Zuma further explained that while he felt compelled to resign, he would remain committed to and will continue to serve the African National Congress (ANC). His address came after the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) affirmed its decision to recall him. Prof. Mcebisi Ndletyana, from the Department of Politics at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), says the pressure which was placed on Zuma by the ANC and nation eventually resulted in his decision. Mdletyana reflects on the changes which have taken place since Zuma left the Presidency. “We are beginning to restore the rule of law but at the same time we are also seeing that corruption is not really personalised, it was institutionalised,” says Prof Mdletyana.
