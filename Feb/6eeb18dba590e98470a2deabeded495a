The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has lambasted the province’s Premier David Makhura, for a projected deficit of R5 billion in the provincial health budget by the end of March. Gauteng Health MEC, Gwen Ramokgopa, confirmed the deficit at a meeting of the Provincial Legislature’s Health Committee last week. She said the department is presently at a deficit of R1 billion and that the remaining amount would accumulate from debt to unpaid suppliers. “This is Premier David Makhura’s greatest failure. He’s simply not managed to transform this department. It’s still inefficient, corrupt and mismanages huge amounts of money without providing a decent health service. It’s time the Gauteng Health Department was properly transformed so that it’s sufficiently run and money is effectively spent, and patients get decent healthcare,” says DA Gauteng Shadow MEC Jack Bloom.
