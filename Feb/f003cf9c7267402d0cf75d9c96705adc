Pupils in Keimoes near Uitenhage in the Northern Cape have been left stranded after the provincial Department of Education failed to pay school transport service providers. Parents say learners in the area are walking over 40 kilometres to the three affected schools. The department says they have requested funds from provincial Treasury, but it is not clear when the money will be transferred to pay service providers across five districts in the province. “We are aware of the fact that there are learners who were not transported as of yesterday and today in Keimoes as a result of delayed payment. However, we are pleading with the service providers not to discontinue the service. They must continue with the service as we engage Treasury to release some funds. However, we want to stress to service providers if they discontinue their service then there will be no payment,” says Lehuma Ntuane, who is the Provincial Spokesperson.
