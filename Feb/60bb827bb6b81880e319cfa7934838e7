Energy Minister Jeff Radebe has switched on a pump in Mfuleni on the Cape Flats that saw water gushing from a newly sunk borehole. The International Islamic Relief Organisation of Saudi Arabia funded the drilling of the borehole. The NGO plans to sink ten boreholes in the Western Cape in the next few weeks. Five of them will be in the Cape Metro and the rest in the drought stricken Karoo, including Beaufort West. The total cost of the project is one million rand. Radebe says bringing water to some communities in the province follows upon an agreement reached between the ANC in the province and the NGO.
