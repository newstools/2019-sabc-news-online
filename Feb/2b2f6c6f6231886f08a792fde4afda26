Three of the learners who were injured after a structure collapsed at Hoërskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark, have been discharged from hospital. Twenty more remain there, some of whom are still in the Intensive Care Unit. Various investigations are underway to determine the cause of the tragedy. Three pupils were killed when a walkway structure collapsed on Friday morning. The father of one of the pupils that lost his life, Dominic Olckers, says his faith has helped ease the pain of losing his 17-year old son. “The Lord needed my son and I am more then glad to have given him for a good worker and I enjoyed every moment with him.” Olckers says the accident could have been avoided. “I suppose it was preventable. I’m pretty sure, as is most things, maintenance or check-ups on the building. I don’t call it an accident, I’m not blaming anybody.” Edward Mosuwe from the Gauteng Department of Education says that the first priority is to deal with trauma. “Until we have dealt with the trauma issues, we will deal [with other things] only after we have dealt with this…” The school remains closed. However, one question begs; who will be held liable for the incident? “In the event that with the investigation, we find that there is negligence, SAPS will be investigating going forward,” said Nikiwe Hoaeane of SAPS. Trauma counselling remains accessible for all pupils at the school as they try to recover from the harrowing experience. watch related videos below:
