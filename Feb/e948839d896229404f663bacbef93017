The Executive Director of Bosasa, now African Global Operations, Papa Leshabane denies that he attempted to negotiate a settlement between African National Congress (ANC) Presidential Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa and the woman who is accusing him of raping her. He says he cannot confirm the claims of drugging and rape made against Kodwa as he was not at the place where the alleged incident took place in April last year. Leshabane says the woman informed him of her representatives’ subsequent engagements with Kodwa. However, he denies that he played a role in the course the woman and her friend who was allegedly also attacked. The allegations against Kodwa were made in a letter sent to the ANC’s office of the Secretary-General. According to the woman, Leshabane asked her not to go to the police after a doctor had found that she had been raped, suggesting she sort out the matter with Kodwa. She says her now then friend attempted to negotiate a financial settlement of first R20 000 and then R50 000. But after five months of no success, the woman and her friend pursue their own course of action. Leshabane has categorically denied playing any negotiation role, saying he simply listened when the woman would sms him about her attempts to get relief.    Meanwhile the ANC Women’s League has called on Kodwa to step aside until the matter is finalised. The League’s General Secretary Meokgo Matuba says they will support the victim and want to see her to find out what happened. She says the ANC should consider suspending Kodwa pending the outcome of the case.
