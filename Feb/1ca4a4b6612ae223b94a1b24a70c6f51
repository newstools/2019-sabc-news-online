Two buses and a police vehicle have been torched during a violent protest at Dipompong village outside Lephalale in Limpopo. The angry community members are demanding the completion of a road project. The project has been abandoned for several months. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says they have arrested 11 suspects for public violence and malicious damage to property. Ngoepe says the arrested suspects are expected to appear in the Phalala Magistrateâ€™s court soon. He says the protesters barricaded roads with stones and various objects and subsequently set two buses alight. Police continue to monitor the situation.
