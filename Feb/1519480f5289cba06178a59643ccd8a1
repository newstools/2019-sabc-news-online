Families will soon start to identify the 18 bodies that have been recovered at the Gloria Coal Mine in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, so far. Five bodies were recovered two weeks ago and 13 others on Friday. An unknown number is feared to be still trapped underground. More than 20 people were trapped underground in the beginning of the month after a gas explosion. They were allegedly stealing copper in the Gupta-owned mine that was closed after it was placed under business rescue last year. The recovery operation is expected to resume on Monday. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says: “We do not have the exact number of people that went into the mineshaft on the 3rd of February this year, however we have been given a list of 22 names and we are working on it…We are using that number as our case study or base.” Watch the video below for related news:
