Eskom has refused to divulge the names and countries of origins of the international banks that will be assisting with its finances. Eskom announced on Friday that it has secured a R 15-billion loan from a consortium of local and international banks. The state owned electricity generating company is in a serious financial crisis. It has a R 419 billion debt that it has to service and is calling for a massive tariff increase. “Generally it’s many of the international banks that we deal with. I’m not in a position to mention specific names, let they themselves go out and mention that they have given us the money. But from our side it’s nothing out of the ordinary. It’s many of the banks that we have always dealt with both locally and abroad,” says Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe.
