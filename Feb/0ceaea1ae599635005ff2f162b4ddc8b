Former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor has told the State Capture Commission – under cross examination – in Parktown, Johannesburg, that there are issues regarding South African Airways (SAA) flight records detailing her alleged trip to Johannesburg to meet then President Jacob Zuma. The legal team at the Commission has argued that there
are no SAA records showing she boarded a plane to Johannesburg on the date in
question. Mentor had last year testified that she boarded an SAA flight to Johannesburg to meet with Zuma. Mentor says she’s compared SAA records with those of the parliamentary travel agency, and there are disparities.
