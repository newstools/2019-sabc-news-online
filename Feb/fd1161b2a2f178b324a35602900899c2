Former African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor will be back on the stand when the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture resumes in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday. She will complete her evidence and be
cross-examined by some of those who have been granted leave to do so. They include Hawks’ Advocate Mandla Mtolo and Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi. So far, some witnesses who have
testified before the commission have implicated a number of officials and
high-profile ANC members in alleged corruption. They include ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe, National Executive Committee member Nomvula Mokonyane, former party deployee Dudu Myeni and Member of Parliament Vincent Smith. Cosatu general-secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says those who are implicated should recuse themselves from any party position until their names are cleared. “They must wait for their fate. We accept that some of them are not guilty until proven otherwise but for the sake of good governance, the best thing is to wait, clear your name and then say I’m ready to be deployed because I’ve been cleared.” Click on video below:
