An Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai turned back several
hours into its journey on Sunday after discovering it did not have permission
to land in China, the airline said. Flight NZ289 carrying about 270 passengers left Auckland shortly
before midnight on Saturday only to return about 10 am on Sunday (2100 GMT
Saturday). It turned around several hours into the flight. “A technicality meant the particular aircraft operating
this service did not have Chinese regulatory authority to land in China,”
the airline said. China’s foreign ministry did not make any immediate comment when
contacted by Reuters. Calls to the civil aviation administration were not
answered. Air New Zealand apologised to passengers and said a special service
would fly them to Shanghai at 11 p.m. on Sunday (1000GMT). “We know customers will be deeply disappointed and frustrated
by this situation and we are very sorry for the disruption to their travel
plans,” Air New Zealand said. Disgruntled passengers voiced their disapproval on social media.
One posted a picture on Twitter of the on board flight map showing the aircraft
turning around over Papua New Guinea. “I’ve just experienced a new level of China Bad: midway
through our flight from Auckland to Shanghai, the pilot informs us that Chinese
authorities had not given this plane permission to land, so we needed to turn
around. A permitting issue, supposedly,” the passenger commented. The same flight, NZ289, was turned back on a flight to China
on August 24 last year, although an airline spokeswoman said that was due to an
engineering issue, not a permitting one.
