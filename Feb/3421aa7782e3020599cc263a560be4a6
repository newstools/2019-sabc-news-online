Heads of state and government representatives are gathering in Ethiopia this week for a meeting of the African Union (AU). This year, the African Union has a special focus on the refugee crisis. They will discuss issues like the
rising challenge of refugees and internally displaced persons, following
conflicts in some parts of Africa. South Sudan, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Somalia generated at least 2 million newly displaced persons in the first half of 2018. Now African leaders are putting their heads together to address this challenge. Women and girls are the worst affected. Conflict has not only exposed them to
rape but also lack of equal opportunities including education and productive
employment. With just over 7% of refugees and 9%
of Internally Displaced Persons resettled, Africa is staring at a bleak future
and her people will be watching keenly to see if leaders gathered in Addis
Ababa will silence the guns by next year ending the cycle of displacements.
