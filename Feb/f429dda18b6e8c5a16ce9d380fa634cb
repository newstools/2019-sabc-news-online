On Tuesday February, 26th 2019, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared that the 6th general elections will be held on the May, 8th 2019 and stated the day will be a public holiday. One has to be registered on the voters’ roll to elect a new National Assembly and new provincial legislatures in each province. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) closed the voters’ roll on Wednesday. IEC Commissioner Moepya Moepya says the IEC is anticipating just over 26, 7-million voters – an increase from the previous general elections. “We do have 26, 7-million, we will finalise those numbers. I’m sure we will issue them because persons who have registered on Tuesday will still go through the verification process with the National Populations Register and we will then validate that and we will issue final figures but we are anticipating that it will be just over 26, 7-million.” Moepya says 82% of the excess of at least 1-million are first time voters. “The majority of those, in access of 82% of those are persons who are young, first time voters but you do have persons who fall between the age of registration since the last elections.” Click on video below:
