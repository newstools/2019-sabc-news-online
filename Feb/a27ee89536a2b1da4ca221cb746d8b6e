The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has issued a statement explaining a violent incident that took place shortly after the adjournment of Parliament on Thursday night. This after a video, in which one of their members is seen slapping a man dressed in a black suit at the exit of Parliament, went public. This happened as the EFF entourage, including party leader Julius Malema, were leaving the Parliamentary precinct after the State of the Nation Address (SONA). The EFF says they were merely defending their leader Malema after receiving information that he was to be assassinated during Thursday nightâ€™s SONA. They have referred all queries regarding the death threats to the police.
