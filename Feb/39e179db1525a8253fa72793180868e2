Police Minister Bheki Cele has reiterated that police are allowed to use deadly force when under attack. He was addressing the commemoration of the five slain police officers at Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape. Three were shot at the police station and two on the outskirts of town last year. Cele says police are there to protect, combat and investigate to ensure all South Africans are safe. He says, “The Criminal Procedure Act Section 49 says police have a duty of protecting the innocent and themselves and when attacked they must use deadly force, the word there is deadly.”
