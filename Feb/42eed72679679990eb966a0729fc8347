Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor says she’s deeply concerned about what she terms an over-security of tertiary institutions in South Africa. Her statement comes after a student, who was involved in protests at the Durban University of Technology‘s Steve Biko campus, was killed last week. Twenty-year-old Mlungisi Madonsela was shot after an altercation with private security guards contracted to the institution. He died while receiving medical
attention at a hospital in Durban. Pandor says the issue of security at institutions of higher learning needs to be urgently dealt with. “I think the security services are a matter that should be looked at far more carefully.” “Sincerest condolences to the Madonsela family on what I think is one of the most painful experiences a parent can go through which is a loss of a child. To lose a child and there’s nothing more terrible than that.”R
