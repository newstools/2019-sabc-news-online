Gauteng Education Department officials are visiting a primary school in Pretoria on Wednesday morning following allegations that a teacher has been sexually assaulting learners at the school. Some of the learners are as young as six-years-old. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona says it’s not clear at the moment how many children have been affected. He says disciplinary processes against the teacher are underway. “It’s important for us to fast-track the process to ensure the teacher is removed from the school. He will report from the district office so that we don’t have the educator in the same environment with the learners.  But what is paramount for us, is the counselling of those learners.  So we have dispatched our psycho-social unit to visit the school and ensure that all the learners are attended to.”
