The South African Revenue Service says drug and currency smugglers will face the full might of the law. This after customs officers intercepted a suspected currency smuggler in possession of almost $1-million which equates to more than R13-million at the OR Tambo International Airport in Gauteng. SARS spokesperson Sicelo Mkosi says customs officers will stop at nothing to intercept suspected smugglers. Mkosi says they have picked up a trend among the suspects. He says: “On a daily basis they continue to test our resolve by trying to smuggle either currency or drugs and so forth. We would want to warn that we would actually stop at nothing and our customs officers will stop at nothing to ensure our ports of entry are safe.”
