The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the African National Congress has established a Rapid Response Team (RRT) to look into challenges facing the ANC in various communities. On Saturday afternoon, the RRT met with members of the former Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) and Provincial Task Team (PTT) to communicate the decision of the NEC on North West. In a statement, the ANC in North West outlines that, among other decisions, the meeting concluded that the two groups will be united into a single PTT. “The primary mandate of this PTT will be to work on elections.” The meeting also decided that North West Premier Job Mokgoro will focus on the administration of the province and the service delivery of the province’s residents. “Comrade Salivar will continue to head the Provincial Elections Team (PET) as head of elections,” reads the statement in part. The PTT will be led by Obed Bapela as its Convenor, and Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane as the Coordinator. The PTT will be supported by Malusi Gigaba, Violet Siwela, David Mahlobo and Nkenke Kekana. The party says alliance partners will be taken on board. Click below for more on the story:
