Six suspects have been arrested over the killing of an investigative journalist in Ghana who helped to expose corruption in African football, police said on Thursday. Ahmed Hussein-Suale, part of a team that carried out an undercover
investigation, was gunned down as he returned to his home in the Accra suburb
of Madina on January 16. The shooting sent shockwaves through Ghana, one of the most stable
democracies in turbulent West Africa and a beacon of media freedom. Chief spokesman for Ghana’s police David Eklu told reporters the suspects
were arrested and then granted bail. “Eyewitnesses have been interviewed and as I speak now six suspects
have been arrested, questioned and are currently on bail,” Eklu
said. “We are working around the clock to get those criminals to face the
full rigours of the laws,” he said, adding a sketch artist had been hired
to make portraits of those seen doing the killing. Police have also taken a statement from veteran MP and businessman Kennedy
Agyapong, who published a photograph of Hussein-Suale on his private television
channel before his death, Eklu said. Agyapong, a prominent figure in the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), also
offered a reward to anyone who attacked the journalist. The broadcast prompted Hussein-Suale to lodge a complaint with the police. Eklu also said police questioned former president of the Ghana Football
Association Kwesi Nyantakyi and journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who led the
investigation into football graft. The documentary by Anas’s Tiger Eye investigation team was aired by the BBC
last June. Exposing deep-seated corruption including rampant match-fixing, it led to
the banning of Nyantakyi, the then-head of the Ghana Football Association, and
dozens of other football officials both in Ghana and across Africa.
