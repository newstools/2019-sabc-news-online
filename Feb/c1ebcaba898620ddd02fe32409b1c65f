Suspended NPA Senior Advocate, Lawrence Mrwebi, has taken the stand to face cross-examination at the Mokgoro Enquiry. On Thursday, Nomgcobo Jiba, was cross-examined. The Enquiry is probing Jiba and her colleague Lawrence Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office. The two have been accused of mishandling high profile corruption cases. On Thursday, Jiba argued that she’s been persecuted by those who never imagined to be led by a black woman. She urged retired Justice Yvonne Mokgoro to come up with recommendations that will protect the independence of prosecutors. “Really I would want the situation whereby, at the end of it all, whether I’m removed from the NPA or not – I humbly request a situation whereby the independence of prosecutors is not weakened. This enquiry must in fact find ways how it can strengthen the independence of the prosecutors. And in my view take the same format that is afforded to the judges.” Click on video below:
