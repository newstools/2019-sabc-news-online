Mining and Energy Advisor Ted Blom says he expects loadshedding to last for the next five years. This comes as President Cyril Ramaphosa said Finance Minister Tito Mboweni will announce government measures to assist Eskom to stabilise its finances. Eskom earlier this week announced that loadshedding would take place after another six generating stations went offline. President Ramaphosa last week announced the splitting of Eskom into three units – generation, distribution and transmission. Trade unions have slammed the move saying they are concerned about possible job losses. Blom says he is not sure if there is political will to solve the problems at Eskom.
