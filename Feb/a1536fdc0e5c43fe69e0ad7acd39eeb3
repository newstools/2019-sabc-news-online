It’s a natural phenonmenon tailor-made for the digital era. This explosion of wild poppies in Southern California has turned towns like Lake Elsinor into instant tourist attractions, as visitors rush to capture the perfect selfie. California resident, Debbie Briant says, “I absolutely love the flowers, I love the bloom and I love the colour of it. It is pretty bright, as you can see, but it is beautiful.” This is Southern California’s second Super Bloom in recent years, thanks to a combination of wildfires to clear the undergrowth and a whole lot of rain. “It was a lot more than I expected. I thought it was just going to be maybe just a little bush here and there but they are all over the place and I keep walking and walking and every time I make a turn it is just more beautiful than the last one” says Francis Silva a Los Angeles resident. Meawhile, local officials have launched a “preserve while you observe” campaign, urging visitors to please stay off the flowers.
