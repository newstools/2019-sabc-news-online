Sentencing proceedings in the case of former property mogul, Jason Rohde, are on Wednesday expected to continue in the High Court in Cape Town. Last year, he was found guilty of murdering his wife Susan at the Spier Wine Estate outside Stellenbosch in 2016. The former property mogul’s mother, Brenda Rohde, earlier testified in mitigation of sentence. She says her son never displayed any signs of aggression. She says, “As a son he’s been a very good son to us. He has always been there and has been caring, just being a stable personality when times have got tough for us. He’s got a heart of gold and I ask the court to be lenient. He is not a threat whatsoever to anybody.”
