The Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions, Willie Hofmeyr will on Tuesday morning conclude his testimony at the Mokgoro Enquiry in Centurion, south of Pretoria. During cross examination on Monday, he argued that the NDPP ignored crucial evidence to prosecute former president Jacob Zuma in the spy tapes matter. The Enquiry is probing fitness to hold office of suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. Hofmeyr says his firm stance against how things were done at
the NDPP nearly got him fired. “[They] really wanted [me] out of the NPA … and even offered me other jobs so that I could be out of the NPA. So all I can gather from the document that’s put in front of me is that this issue was not pursued further. And I would welcome the opportunity to go back and find out what happened to it afterwards,” adds Hofmeyer.
