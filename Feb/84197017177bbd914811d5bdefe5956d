Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has raised concern about the lack of security at the Gloria Coal Mine in Middelburg in Mpumalanga which he feels led to the illegal miners gaining entry to the facility and becoming trapped. The people were allegedly trying to steal copper cables when they became trapped. At least 12 people died. A number of bodies are believed to still be trapped in the mine. The minister says the mine should beef up its security. Mantashe says the mine should also find a way of retrieving the trapped people. The rescue operation has been halted following the bad weather conditions and toxic gas in the mine shaft.    Watch video below for more on the story:
