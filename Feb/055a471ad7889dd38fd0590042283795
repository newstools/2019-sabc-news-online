The Film and Publication Board (FPB) has urged South African parents to closely monitor their children’s online Internet activities, especially the games that they download. Acting Chief Executive of the Film and Publication Board, Maria Motebang, says the warning follows information from abroad that claims that the game, “Momo Challenge”, is a form of cyber-bullying that targets children. It allegedly encourages self-harm that may lead to suicide. The FPB has requested parents to download monitoring apps on their children’s devices to inspect their online behaviour. Research in South Africa has shown that children as young as 10 are being allowed to play games with an age restriction of 18, exposing them to gruesome violence and offensive language.
