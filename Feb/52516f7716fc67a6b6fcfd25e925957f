African National Congress (ANC) spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, has asked to be relieved of his duties while  investigations of rape allegations against him continue. The party’s NWC has agreed to the request but says Kodwa remains a National Executive Committee (NEC) member. At the weekend, reports surfaced that Kodwa had allegedly raped a woman last year and offered to pay her off. The party was notified of the allegation and they advised the woman to file a criminal complaint with law enforcement. Kodwa denies the allegations and labelled it “dirty tricks”. Pule Mabe,  another spokesperson, has requested more time away from his job after the party cleared him of sexual harassment allegations last week. He too remains an NEC member. Secretary General Ace Magashule addressed a media conference following the NWC meeting . ” The ANC accepted that Zizi step aside with the allegations so he doesn’t speak for the ANC during this time. As well as Pule Mabe who asked to remain at home.” Watch video below:
