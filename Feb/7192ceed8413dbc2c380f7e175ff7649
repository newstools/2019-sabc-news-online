The four suspects, accused of robbing the state-of-the-art Menzi Primary School in Tsakane, east of Johannesburg, will be back in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday for a formal bail application. The robbery took place early last month a few days after the Gauteng Education Department opened the school. The case was postponed to give the State time to probe the men’s legal status. The four foreign nationals were arrested during an intelligence-driven operation in the Johannesburg CBD. Equipment, believed to have been stolen from the school, was recovered. Police say 22 tablets and three laptops were recovered when the men were arrested.
