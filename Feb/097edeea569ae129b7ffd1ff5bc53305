The funeral service of one of the learners that died in the HoÃ«rskool Driehoek tragedy is currently underway in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal. Roydon Olckers died last week after
the cement walkway connecting two buildings at the school collapsed. Olckers is one of the four that died
as a result of the incident. The church, with just under a hundred seats, is packed to capacity as friends, parents and teachers gather to lay Olckers to rest. Others have been forced to listen from
outside the church. They have spilt over to the steps and
into the garden of the church. Many have shed tears and others are
seeking comfort from their colleagues in and outside the church. Over 20 others
were injured in the tragedy. The Gauteng Education Department has since confirmed that about 12 learners have been discharged from hospital and are recovering at home. Click video below:
