President Donald Trump has edged closer to defying the power of the US Congress by declaring a national emergency in an attempt to obtain funding for a US-Mexico border wall. Trump says that he might declare such an emergency because it doesn’t appear that Democrats in Congress are moving towards a deal that would provide the money he wants to help fund the wall. Under the US Constitution, Congress holds the national purse strings and approves major expenditures of taxpayer funds. Trump has discussed possibly declaring an emergency and redirecting funds already allocated by Congress for other purposes, possibly at the Defense Department, to his wall. President Trump says, “We will be looking at a national emergency because I don’t think anything is going to happen. I don’t think the democrats want boarder security and when I hear them talk about the fact that walls are immoral and walls don’t work; they know they work.”
