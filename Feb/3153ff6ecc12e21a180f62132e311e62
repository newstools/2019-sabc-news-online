The opposition party in Nigeria has called on the country’s electoral commission to release the results from Saturday’s presidential election. As vote counting continues from the 120 000 polling stations, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) wants its candidate Atiku Abubakar to be declared the winner. The PDP Secretary-General in South Africa, Emeka Ugwu says there has been violence in the opposition stronghold and some polling stations officials were attacked. “What we are trying to do is to make the international community and Nigerians to know that there are some sinister moves to change the result of yesterday’s election. “What I can tell you is that in each polling booth there are representatives of each political party. The second thing is that the election was marred in so many parts of Lagos and a couple of other places, most of these places are PDP strongholds.” However, the ruling APC party of President Muhammadu Buhari has dismissed the allegations as unfounded. APC national chairperson in South Africa Bola Babarinde says it is unfortunate that PDP is violating the electoral accord.  Dozens killed in Nigeria poll violence As many as 39 people have been killed in election violence in Nigeria, civil society groups said on Sunday, as the country awaited the results of voting in what was forecast to be its tightest election since the end of military rule in 1999. The Situation Room – which represents more than 70 civil society groups – gave the death toll the day after voting, citing data from Lagos-based consultancy SBM Intelligence. But authorities were braced for the possibility of further unrest after election results emerge later this week. -Additional reporting by Reuters
