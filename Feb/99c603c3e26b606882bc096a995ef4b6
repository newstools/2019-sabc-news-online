Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor says no student should be prevented from registering on the basis of historical debt and especially if they are funded by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The Minister met with all presidents of Student Representative Councils in Pretoria over the weekend. This follows several protests at
institutions of higher learning last week leading to suspension of classes in
some institutions. Students were demanding among others
that students with historical debt be allowed to register and for the
institutions to help provide students with accommodation. The meeting resolved to allow the
student councils to report back to their constituencies on the outcomes of the
meeting. In some institutions protests were put
on hold pending negotiations. The minister’s spokesperson Lunga
Ngqengelele says Pandor expects students to return to classes following the
meeting. “On issues relating to accommodation the minister explained that the department is committed to working with universities to make accommodation available wherein we are going to be supplying about 300-thousand beds. It’s a ten year programme.” Click on video below:
