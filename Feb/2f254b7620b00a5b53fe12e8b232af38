The African National Congress (ANC) says it will appeal the judgment by the High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday to reinstate the North West Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) led by Supra Obakeng Mahumapelo. The court ruled that the ANC’s National Executive Committee’s decision was unlawful and broke its own constitution when it decided to disband the PEC  in the North West. Chairperson of the North West ANC, Mahumapelo explains that discussions have been taking place between the two parties for a negotiated solution. “We are already in discussions even before the court ruling, we were in discussions with our leadership at Luthuli House so there are some serious discussions that are taking place.” Click on interview below: Click on video below:
