The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape is expecting Premier Sylvia Lucas to outline plans to alleviate poverty, unemployment and inequality in her State of the Province Address (SOPA) this week. Speaking on the sidelines of the party’s provincial Lekgotla in Kimberley, the party’s provincial Chairperson Zamani Saul says Lucas should also indicate plans to fight corruption in government and improve the quality of education. Saul says the aim of the one-day Lekgotla is to assess the progress the party has made in the past five years. “We’re going to make rigorous assessment of the progress that we’ve made. These processes are linked. A month ago, we launched a manifesto. We are going to look into our manifesto for 2019 general elections; what are the issues which we can pick out and implement. Issues that we’re focusing on here are creation of jobs and fighting poverty in the province. “The last State of the Province Address for the 5th administration – we expect the premier just to highlight some of the achievements, highlight some of the challenges that are still there,” says Saul.
