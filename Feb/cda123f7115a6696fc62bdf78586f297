Vodacom says its compensation to the Please Call Me inventor, Kenneth Makate, is final and will not change. The mobile giant briefed the media on Friday morning. According to the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Till Streichert, only courts can amend the offer. The company defended its company Chief Executive Officer, Shameel Joosub. This follows concerns that he’s conflicted. Streichert says Vodacom did not generate a substantial amount from revenue from the service because it’s free. “There no direct attributable revenue as part of the Please Call Me message because it has never been charged, to the question of did it actually generate incremental revenue from costumers calling back. That is a highly speculative question, given that normal calling patterns are occurring and evolving over time and we have not been seeing any incremental revenue with regard to that proposition in particular because we have never been able to charge for it,” says Streichert.
