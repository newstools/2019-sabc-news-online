The state must enforce existing laws effectively and efficiently against religious leaders found in the wrong. That’s according to Michael Swain from Freedom of Religion South Africa. He was speaking after the national religious leaders summit that was held in Johannesburg last week. The summit was held by the CRL Rights Commission and was attended by over 800 church leaders from across the country to address issues that are plaguing the religious community. Many religious leaders were unhappy about the findings in the CRL’s report titled “Commercialisation of religion and the abuse of the peoples’ belief system.” These church leaders opposed the report and said the CRL had a threatening tone. Swain says churches are already regulated.
