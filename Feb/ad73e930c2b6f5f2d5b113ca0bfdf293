The bodies of 24-illegal miners have now been recovered from a gold mine in Zimbabwe that was flooded following heavy rains. Eight people have been rescued from the mine near the town of Kadoma, south west of the capital Harare. Authorities say at least 70 people were trapped when the disaster struck on Tuesday night. The company that owns one of the mines, Rio Zimbabwe, says people entered the shafts illegally to look for gold. The operation is still ongoing and authorities are hoping to retrieve more bodies. They are also hopeful they will find more survivors as the day progresses. Water is still being pumped from the sections that rescue workers have not been able to reach, where more bodies are expected to be found.
