Security arrangements around Parliament has once again provoked criticism from citizens. Several roads in the Cape Town CBD have been cordoned off in anticipation of Thursday night’s opening of Parliament. There is a heavy police presence in the area. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the nation at seven o’clock. Citizens have complained about the impact of the road closures. “I just came here, didn’t know the roads would be closed. I was here for this shop, unfortunately is closed. Lack of communication. “ “I was supposed to be in court and I never got parking, it’s really an issue.” “They obviously need to take security measures, however there are quite a lot of resources out here, so the extent, the amount of police out here…they could tone that down a bit.”
