Cosatu leadership will on Monday morning meet with municipal workers of the Vhembe District Municipality in Thohoyandou, Limpopo to decide the way forward, after a two-week strike. The workers are demanding the arrest of people who killed two senior members of trade union Samwu, who were employed at the municipality.
