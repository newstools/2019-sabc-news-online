Dozens of animal activists in the Eastern Cape are calling on government to shut down the East London Zoo. They say living conditions at the facility are not conducive for wild animals. For the second time in weeks the activists held a peaceful protest at the zoo. The zoo is one of the oldest in the county. Elizabeth Kan is from the Ban the Animal Trading Organisation. “They are also isolated. They are not with their own kind. They are alone and they are in a restricted environment where they suffer from zoo ciasis, which is a type of depression. We just feel that all kinds of animal exploitation in 2019 should come to an end,” says Kan.
