The African National Congress’ (ANC) head of presidency and acting spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa has released a statement denying rape allegations. A woman has come forward accusing Kodwa of having sexually assaulted her after allegedly drugging her at a private party in April last year. In the statement, Kodwa refers to these allegations as “extortion and blackmail” against him. He says these accusations are a “dirty tricks campaign”. In the same statement, Kodwa says he is in the process of seeking legal advice in relation to a possible case of extortion or defamation. ANC Acting spokesperson, Dakota Legoete says there is not much they can say about the allegations, as this is a case that should be opened with the police.   Read Kodwa’s statement:  Meanwhile, the ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) has called on the ANC Acting Spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, to step aside following rape allegations levelled against him. Earlier, the ANC confirmed a receipt of a letter from the woman in which she alleges that Kodwa raped her at a private party last year. ANC Women’s League General Secretary, Meokgo Matuba, says they will support the victim and want to see her to find out what happened.
