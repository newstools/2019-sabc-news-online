The lawyer for suspended National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba has confirmed that former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi will appeared before the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria at a date yet to be determined. As the enquiry resumes senior police officer Kobus Roelofse is expected to conclude his testimony. During his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Agrizzi alleged that Jiba received bribes in order to block investigations. Jiba’s lawyer Zola Majavu says they welcome the chance to cross-examine Agrizzi. “We expressly said we would like him to come to this enquiry so we were told yesterday that he is going to come. What the evidence leaders and ourselves are busy grappling with is just around the dates. Of course we welcome the opportunity to cross examine Mr Agrizzi,” adds Majavu.
