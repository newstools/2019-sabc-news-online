Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa has held talks with diplomats accredited to his country. Mnangagwa has come under pressure for failing to address the challenges facing Zimbabwe. He told the diplomats that his government is implementing the recommendations given to them by the Commission of Inquiry led by former President Kgalema Motlanthe that looked at the post-election violence. Back from the African Union summit where Mnangagwa held talks with many African leaders to share information on the situation in his country, the first order of business was engaging the diplomats. This is part of the campaign to lobby support. The security forces have come under fire on how they handled the recent protests that turned violent. President Mnangagwa says violence has no place in the country. Mnangagwa has also assured the diplomats that the recommendations from the Motlanthe Commission are being implemented. He called on the opposition parties that have boycotted the political dialogue to reconsider their position. The opposition says it will only join the political dialogue under an independent mediator.
