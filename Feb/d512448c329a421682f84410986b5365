In his reply to the debate, in the National Assembly, the President refuted the allegations and says such inquiry would be a waste of taxpayers’ money. “I can testify that I have never ever been a spy. I’ve never worked with the enemy. All I have ever done in my life is my commitment to the people of our country – that’s all. “You say you want us to establish a judicial commission. I have no interest as President of this country to appoint judicial commissions which are going to waste taxpayers money for nothing; that I will not do, because the ordinary people of our country know that there is no truth in this thing,” Ramaphosa defended. Earlier, President Ramaphosa has wished the women of South Africa a Happy Valentine’s Day.  Ramaphosa also handed out roses to his wife, who is seated in the Parliamentary gallery, as well as the female Members of Parliament.
