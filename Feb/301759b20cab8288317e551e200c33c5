 Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) members have arrived at the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. The labour federation has called a national strike against job losses and the high unemployment rate in the country. The march started at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown in Johannesburg. Marches are planned across eight cities throughout the country.  Members of Cosatu-affiliated unions in the Western Cape will take to the streets on Tuesday, next week. Cosatu Gauteng chairperson Amos Monyela, says they will be calling for an end to retrenchments. A large police contingent has also been deployed to Newtown and officers are keeping a close eye on proceedings.  Meanwhile, in Limpopo, lessons have been disrupted in some parts of the province as teachers who are members of Sadtu have joined the Cosatu nationwide industrial action against job losses. Some learners in Thohoyandou are not happy that they’ve been turned back from school. “No it won’t help us because they have to teach us, soon they will saying we are not doing well at school. So it is not good when they are striking and we have to miss our classes,” adds affected pupils. –  Additional reporting by Rudzani Tshivhase
