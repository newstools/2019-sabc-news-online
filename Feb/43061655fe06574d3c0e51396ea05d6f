Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communications says that it hopes to finalise the shortlisting process for new SABC Board members before the end of March. Chair of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communications, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize, says the committee is looking at candidates with a good track record. Mkhize was speaking on SAFM’s Sunrise show. “We’ll be looking for critical skills, of course people with a good track record of integrity, with no criminal record and really the core thing is to look at the skills and of course representation in terms of the demographics of the country.” Mkhize hopes to complete the process within three to four weeks. “We were just talking generally as a committee looking at a period of three to four weeks including the vetting which won’t be done by us and of course the presentation of the names to parliament so we are hoping we will meet all the deadlines.”  Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/657156">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
