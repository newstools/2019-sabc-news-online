Former  African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor is back on the stand at the  Commission of Inquiry into State Capture underway in Parktown, Johannesburg. Mentor, who previously appeared at the commission, testified that she refused a ministerial position offered to her by the Guptas. Evidence leader Mahlape Sello has presented to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that records from the Department of Home Affairs show that Atul Gupta was in the country in August 2010. The Commission is now dealing with matters that Mentor included in her previous testimony pertaining to the residence of the Gupta family. Mentor previously told the Commission how she boarded a
flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg, where she was expected to meet with then
President Jacob Zuma. She included in her testimony that she was taken to the
Gupta Saxonwold home, where she claims she met Zuma and the Gupta brothers. The commission has since conducted their own inspection at
the property, accompanied by Mentor. Meanwhile, an in loco investigation by the Commission has found only one home, at number five Saxonwold Drive, the home which belongs to the Gupta family. This revelation appears to contradict testimony of Mentor where she previously testified at the commission that she remembers four to five houses in the Gupta compound. She has told the commission that during the in loco inspection the other homes were not part of the so called Gupta compound.
