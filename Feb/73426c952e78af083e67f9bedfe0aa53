Retired Judge Robert Nugent reinforced all the recommendations in his final South African Revenue Services (Sars) report when he appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance in Parliament on Wednesday. Nugent was appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to probe tax administration and governance at the Sars during former Commissioner Tom Moyane’s tenure. Moyane was fired by Ramaphosa in November 2018 following the recommendations in Nugent’s interim report. Nugent says former Sars Commissioner, Tom Moyane, destroyed key oversight bodies and systems at Sars. He says he stands by his recommendation for the re-establishment of capacity to monitor the illicit trade of cigarettes, and the re-establishment of the Large Business Unit, which used to handle tax administration for high net-worth individuals and companies. Nugent says the Commission of Inquiry into Sars gave the revenue service employees a rare opportunity to share their feelings without the fear of intimidation which had characterised the organisation under Moyane’s leadership. Nugent says a lot of staff members still remain displaced within the organisation.
