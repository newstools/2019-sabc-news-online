Police Minister Bheki Cele says they will act hard against police officers who collude with known groups terrorising communities in the Vhembe region in Limpopo. “The first intervention to be made will be to arrest the criminals, that should happen in the possible shortest time. There are political matters that I will take to the political structures, but we are here to deal with criminal activities. The community has raised issues here that some of our officers on the ground – to such an extent they go and accused them of colluding sometimes with the criminals and we are going to be very hard to any police officer that collude with criminals,” says Cele. Cele has visited the families of two slain senior members of trade union SAMWU, Ronald Mani and Timson Musetsho, in Lufule outside Thohoyandou to update them on police investigations. Mani and Musetsho died after being shot in two separate incidents around Thohoyandou last week. He has assured the families that arrests will be made soon.
