Health services have been restored at the Jane Furse Hospital in Limpopo which was damaged by floods in December. Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba says most of the repairs have been completed. Ramathuba conducted an inspection of
the hospital which began re-admitting patients in January. A thunderstorm, which hit Jane Furse in Sekhukhune in December, left a trail of destruction at the hospital. Several parts of the hospital were flooded during the storms which lead to the temporary closure of the hospital. The Minister of Health Aaron
Motsoaledi and Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba acknowledged they had to call for
urgent repairs and renovations. In January, the maternity wing began
re-admitting patients. Ramathuba says it is now fully functional. “We have done almost all the repairs.
The issues that are remaining will be long standing issues, which warrant the
province and infrastructure at the province to assist us with a permanent
solution, especially when you look at the drainage system up there.” Local residents say they are relieved
to have a fully functional hospital again. “We are happy. The staff treats us
very well, we are happy the hospital is now open. I am happy; we are being
looked after at this hospital although we are struggling with access to water
at this ward.” “Patients who were moved to
neighbouring hospitals, especially those undergoing TB treatment, have also
returned to Jane Furse. Ramathuba says over 100 patients have already been
admitted at the hospital.” The hospital still faces challenges such
as the shortage of water in some wards, including the maternity section. Patients have also complained about
the shortage of linen and beds.
