Durban University Technology  (DUT) student, Mlungisi Madonsela has been buried at his homestead at Msiyane area in Jozini, northern KwaZulu Natal. Madonsela was gunned down last week Monday after a scuffle between students and campus security guards at the Steve Biko campus in Durban. The EFF and the Madonsela’s family say they are concerned that no-one has been arrested in connection with his death. EFF secretary general, Godrich Gardee, says the justice system has failed them as no one has been arrested. “This is what is happening in the security services of this country.”  It was a sombre mood as hundreds of DUT students, mainly EFF members, came to bid farewell to one of their own. EFF members dressed in party regalia, paraded along the road accompanying Madonsela’s body in a slow moving vehicle, as he was welcomed home. They were chanting slogans and singing struggle songs as traffic came to a standstill. 21-year-old Mlungisi Madonsela is alleged to have been shot by a security guard at the Durban University. Those who were with him claim that they were provoked by security guards who ordered them to leave the university premises. A scuffle broke out when the guards used teargas and the students retaliated by pelting the guards with stones. Several gunshots were fired by the security guards and Madonsela was hit. He died at a Durban hospital a short while later. Madonsela’s uncle, Xolani Ncanana, says they will take the matter to court. Classes at DUT had been suspended for over a week following his death. In a statement, the institution says academic programmes will resume on Monday.
