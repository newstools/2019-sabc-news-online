The African National Congress (ANC) has advised the woman who is accusing the party’s Head of Presidency and acting spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa of rape to go to the police because she is not an ANC member. The party’s Deputy Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte, confirmed on Saturday that they had received a letter from the woman in which she alleges that Kodwa raped her at a private party in 2018. “The advice we have given the complainant is that she needs to go to the criminal justice system with her complaint in a sense that it’s a bit different from when there is difficulty between staff and membership. This is something that to our understanding happened in a private party setting, of course that’s the allegation. Therefore the ANC really cannot do anything about it in terms of finding relevant facts, investigating it properly, that is the work of the criminal justice system,” says Duarte. The allegations against Kodwa come less than a week after the ANC’s spokesperson, Pule Mabe, was cleared of sexual harassment allegations by his former personal assistant. Kodwa was acting as ANC spokesperson after Mabe took special leave pending the outcome of an ANC panel investigation into the allegations. Watch a related video below:
