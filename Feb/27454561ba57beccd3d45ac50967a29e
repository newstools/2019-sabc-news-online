The Mokgoro Enquiry has raised concerns after former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer Angelo Agrizzi announced that he will no longer testify at the hearings in Pretoria. In a brief letter sent to retired Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, Agrizzi’s lawyers say their client’s position has changed due to pending criminal charges against him. He was arrested last week on charges of fraud and corruption. Agrizzi was expected to testify about allegations of bribes he recently made against suspended senior  National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi at the Zondo Commission on State Capture. Evidence leader Nazreen Bawa says Agrizzi is not the only witness to be lost to the Enquiry. Meanwhile, NPA deputy head Willie Hofmeyr will again take the stand at the Enquiry. His cross examination was postponed on Tuesday following gruelling cross-examination from both Jiba and Mrwebi‘s legal teams earlier this week. This comes after Hofmeyr gave damning testimony against Jiba and Mrwebi. He made allegations of political interference and lack of action against corruption cases under Jiba and Mrwebi’s watch. However, Hofmeyr’s credibility as a witness was questioned multiple times. This after the role Hofmeyer played in the NPA’s controversial decision to drop corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma in April 2009.
