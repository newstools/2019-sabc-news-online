Former president, Thabo Mbeki, says the State Capture Inquiry should be allowed to conclude its work but insists law enforcement agencies should do their work to probe some of the allegations. Mbeki was taken on a private tour of the Freedom Park Heritage site in Pretoria. Dozens of senior officials and the former president have been implicated in corrupt relations with Bosasa at the Zondo Commission. Allegations include fraud, corruption and money laundering, some of which happened under Mbeki’s tenure as president. Despite growing calls for President Cyril Ramaphosa to act against those implicated, Mbeki says the commission should be allowed to finish its work while investigations continue. “There are state organs and other organs who are obviously following what is happening at that commission and it would perfectly at liberty to act in terms of their own mandate so that the police or whoever else they can act on that. But in terms of the president of the republic he has to wait for a report from the commission. It must complete its work, submit its report and he must then consider the report and decide what to do.”
