Managing Director at Business Partners, Ben Bierman says that not much mention was made about Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises (SMMEs) during the State of the Nation Address on Thursday. Bierman says however, the little that was mentioned could make things easier for small businesses. “There was not a lot mentioned on SMMEs, but I think if one takes for instance the drive to improve our competitiveness rating and the ease of doing business – all of those initiatives would make things easier for small businesses in terms of removing some of the red tape.” Bierman says a vital point made by the president was how SMMEs could drive economic activities through exports. “For SMMEs I think that, that could be quite vital as well, in the sense that we need to find new markets for those already existing businesses to ensure that they also grow bigger.” Bierman says the biggest constraint SMMEs face is funding; however he is hopeful that the Budget Speech will be clearer about startup capital and funding for small businesses.
