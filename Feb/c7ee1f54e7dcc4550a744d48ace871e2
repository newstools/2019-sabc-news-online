Emergency services departments in the northern parts of the country are on high alert after the South African Weather Service issued a warning of heavy rains and localised flooding earlier on Thursday. Residents in low laying areas are encouraged to keep a lookout for a rise in water levels.   In recent years, persistent rainfall has resulted in flash floods, leaving many homeless. This week, the South African Weather Service has issued a warning of heavy rainfall in parts of Gauteng, Free State, Limpopo and the North West. While no severe incidents have been reported in Johannesburg, Emergency Services remains on high alert. Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson Nana Radebe says if water levels rise, residents on river banks should save their lives and not furniture. For road users, the wetter than usual road surface coupled with Stage 2 loadshedding means static traffic. With rainfall is expected to continue well into the weekend, motorists are discouraged from attempting to cross flooded roads.
