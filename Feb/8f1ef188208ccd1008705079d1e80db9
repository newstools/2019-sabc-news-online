Lack of school infrastructure continues to impede learning and teaching in Limpopo. Hundreds of schools don’t have proper classrooms and sanitation. Parents are hoping Finance Minister Tito Mboweni will channel more funds to Education. John Mutheiwana High is one of the best performing schools in the province. Since 2015, it’s achieved a 100% matric pass rate. A few weeks ago, parents closed the school, demanding better infrastructure. Although the school has since received five mobile classrooms, pupils are still learning under trees. The old classrooms are dilapidated. Community leader Musiiwa Mulaudzi says, “We really appreciate what the government has done for us, bringing those mobile classes. But this is not a permanent solution. We still want the government to come back to us with a solution. What we need is a permanent infrastructure.” For years, pupils at Maanda-Mahulu Primary in Mulima attended classes in the corrugated structures. After severe storm damage a few weeks ago, they were moved to the new state-of-the-art school Limpopo MEC for Education Ishmael Kgetjepe says, “We are working around the clock to make sure that we have projects running on the ground every year. This year, we have above a billion allocated to 111 schools.” Limpopo had the lowest 2018 matric pass at 69.4 %.
