Eskom says it will resume Stage 3 loadshedding starting from 8:00 to 23:00 on Wednesday. The power utility says it
has a shortage of capacity because a number of generating units are out of
service due to breakdowns. Eskom says its maintenance
teams will continue to work hard to bring units back online. Four units totalling 1 675 megawatts have been back online. An additional
600-megawatts are expected to return to service. Eskom says despite the
return of the generating units as planned and some replenishment of diesel
supplies, the water and diesel emergency reserves are still very low. Meanwhile, the power utility says it is concerned about the risk to its operations as a result of Cosatu’s planned national strike. Click on videos below:
