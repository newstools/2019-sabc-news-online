The Democratic Alliance (DA) has slammed the North West government for erecting marquees as a venue for the delivery of the State of the Province Address. The party says existing infrastructure could have been used instead. DA’s Karin Visser says, “We have to know what it costs to erect that massive venue there when, as you say, there is other places, other venues that we can utilise. Specially in times like these where we have got roads that we cannot travel on; we have got people without water.” Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it will only take the premier’s utterances seriously, if politicians implicated in corruption are arrested. The remarks follow a debate on the address which was held last week. “Arrest of the so-called Big Fish, who the ANC rhetoric has told us he is responsible for corruption and collapsing of service delivery in the province. Suspend, investigate and arrest former MEC of Agriculture for illegal disposal of wild animals,” says EFF’s Papiki Babuile. ANC member of the provincial legislature Raymond Elisha, has come to the premier’s defence. “We will continue raising issues about corruption ourselves. We will not wait for you to raise these issues on our behalf. We will continue to raise and we will continue to address these issues of corruption in a manner that we feel we need to deal with. You have raised a whole host of demands to the ANC to deal with certain issues i am not going to get into the details of that.”
