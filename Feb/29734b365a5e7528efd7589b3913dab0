The Mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato, has marked his 100 days in office by highlighting projects that aim to improve the lives of residents. Plato addressed several issues including unemployment and reduced water restrictions during an informal feedback session in Cape Town on Wednesday night. He said the approval of the city’s adjustment budget during council two weeks ago was key in ensuring that certain projects take preference. Plato said one of these include the beefing up of the city’s law enforcement unit. “We budgeted a R165 million for safety and security specifically for the appointment of over a 100 new metro police officers and the whole R165 million is an inclusive package built into that  – the buying of equipment such as buying of uniforms buying of extra vehicles and also the training aspect,” says Plato.
