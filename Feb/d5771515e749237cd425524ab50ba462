The United States (US) has called on Zimbabwe to end its security forces’ excessive use of force and embrace national dialogue. In a statement, State Department has expressed serious concern about the actions of security forces since January 14, which resulted in the deaths of at least 12 people and the wounding of several others. Those victims suffered violence, torture or rape while more than 1 000 people were arrested during protests against dire economic conditions in the country. The US says the Zimbabwe government’s use of violence against civil society and the imposition of undue internet restrictions betray promises to create a new era in the country. The statement calls on all sides to come together
immediately in national dialogue, one that must be credible, inclusive and
mediated by a neutral third party. In order for such a dialogue to succeed, the statement continues – the Government of Zimbabwe should end its excessive violence and intimidation, immediately release civil society activists who have been arbitrarily detained and hold security force members responsible for human rights violations and abuses accountable. Washington also reiterated its call for Zimbabwe’s government to enact promised political and economic reforms. Watch a related video below:
