The Tripartite Alliance partners in the Free State are at loggerheads over the expulsion of 16 ANC councillors in the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in QwaQwa. The SACP has even vowed not to campaign for the ANC if the expelled councillors are not re-instated. The 16 councillors have taken their fight to court. They accuse the ANC of flouting its processes. The expelled group was found guilty of voting with the oppositions during the election of the new executive mayor. They are challenging their expulsion in the High Court. Free State SACP second deputy secretary, Mojalefa Simango they are highly opposed to the decision. “For the ANC to expel 16 councillors, as the SACP, we disagree with the ANC. We are not going to support ANC in the by elections for sits that are outstanding its possession.” Free State COSATU secretary, Monyatso Mahlatsi concurs. “We are concerned about the situation in Maloti-a-Phofung. The situation shouldn’t have come in this situation because we believe both the ANC and the government should have intervened in that area to make sure that situation doesn’t come.” Both the SACP and COSATU say the mass expulsions are nothing, but purging of political foes in the Free State. Politicial analyst, Dr Sethulego Matebesi, believes the move would have negative impact on organisational unity. “I strongly believe that 16 councillors some of the people may not vote against the ANC, but they may stay away from voting during elections and this will have serious implications.” Free State ANC deputy chairperson, William Bulwane says they were left with no option, but to rein in truant councillors. “We don’t understand why it’s so difficult that Alliance when we have discipline our members who didn’t want to be discipline, it becomes a big issue but we are not backing down, we are filling vacancies.” The SACP has also rejected the Free State ANC’s list. The Communist Party says the list is riddled with the names of those implicated in corrupt activities.
