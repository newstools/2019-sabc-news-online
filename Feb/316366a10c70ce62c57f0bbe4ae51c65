Newly elected Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has promised to focus on service delivery. On Tuesday, the council elected Mokgalapa as the new mayor to replace Solly Msimanga, who officially left office on Monday citing he wanted to focus on his Gauteng premiership candidacy campaign ahead of the May 8 general elections. “My first priority is on service delivery. I’m quite focused on ensuring that the city does the basic service delivery services. I want to see the grass being cut, I want to see potholes fixed, I want to see streetlights that are functioning, I want to see the city being cleaned and refuse being removed quite frequently,” says Mokgalapa. He has also vowed to settle controversies around the irregularly awarded tender to an engineering company GladAfrica within a week in office. “What I can promise you is that this matter will be sorted out in due course, within a week. I want to look at legal means of extracting the city from this contract and cancelling it once and for all and focusing on our service delivery mandate.” Click on the audio below for more: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/654563">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on video below:
