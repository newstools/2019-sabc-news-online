The Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Willie Hofmeyr says he made a mistake by supporting a decision not to prosecute former president Jacob Zuma in 2009. The 2017 Supreme Court of Appeal
judgment criticised his role in the matter. Hofmeyr is appearing before the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria. The enquiry is probing the fitness of suspended NPA senior advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to hold office. Hofmeyr said during cross examination
that the decision to prosecute Zuma was at the time aimed to benefit his
predecessor Thabo Mbeki to be re-elected at the Polokwane ANC conference. Hofmeyr, was questioned by Jiba’s
lawyer, Norman Arendse. Click on video below:
