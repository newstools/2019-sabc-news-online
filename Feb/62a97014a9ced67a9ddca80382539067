The Dikgatlong Local Municipality in the Northern Cape has
received a backlash from residents of Smith’s Mine near Barkley West after
failing to provide them with basic services. The former mining area, which comprises more than one hundred households, has had no water, proper sanitation or electricity for more than twenty four years. Residents claim all they have received from the municipality
are empty promises. Boitumelo Keopetse is a member of a committee representing
residents. “They told the
parents that they will bring a jojo tank and they will bring solar. They say
that they will bring a [mobile] clinic but they never did that. So we are
asking for any political party to come help us because the ANC keeps on failing
us,” adds Keopetse.
