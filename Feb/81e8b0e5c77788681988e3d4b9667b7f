Home Affairs Minister Dr Siyabonga Cwele has on Monday paid an unannounced visit at the Scottburgh Home Affairs to visit Nosipho Mkhupheka and to monitor service delivery. This is after Mkhupheka was on spotlight over the weekend after social media user Marius Botha posted that he was moved by her dedication to her work as she assisted citizens beyond office hours. “Ms Mkhupheka is one best example of the thousands of Home
Affairs officials who are dedicated to serve our people with a smile. When I
arrived, the office was full and she was still assisting our citizens. The
people who were there at the time I arrived said they appreciated her work,”
says Cwele. Cwele says the Home Affairs Department has thousands of
unsung heroes who quietly go about doing their work. He encouraged them to
continue serving with integrity and pride. Mkhupheka has been a civil servant in KwaZulu-Natal for 30
years. She moved to her current position as a supervisor at the Scottburgh Home
Affairs office in 2012. “When I leave my home each morning, I put myself in the
shoes of the citizens who come to our office. I greet them when we open our
office and regularly communicate with them should we have challenges”, says
Mkhupheka. Mkhupheka has also thanked her team for the support. “What happened last
week surprised me. I wasn’t expecting it. Usually, I would be working beyond
office hours with Elvis Mavundla and Malcolm Ratube. They left shortly before
the picture was taken and after we assessed how we were going to assist the
citizens,” said Mkhupheka. Minister Cwele has been visiting front line service delivery
offices throughout the country. “I support the
Department’s efforts of finding lasting solutions to the connectivity
challenges. I thank all those staff members who go beyond the call of duty to
practice the principles of Batho Pele on a daily basis,” says Cwele.
