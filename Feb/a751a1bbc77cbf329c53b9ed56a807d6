The South African Federation of Trade Union (Saftu) and its affiliated partner unions have accused the government of presenting a Budget Speech which only serves rich. The march took place ahead of Finance Minister Tito Mboweniâ€™s Budget Speech. Some hundred workers aligned to Saftu and affiliated unions have taken to the streets of the Cape Town CBD calling for a pro-poor-centered budget and end to unemployment. Members of the Food and Allied Workers Union and metal workers union, Numsa, are two of the bigger unions which are taking part in the march. Leading the movement to Parliament, Saftu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said the gap between rich and poor was widening with no concise solutions coming from government. He said for the past 25 years, government has presented a Budget Speech, which only serves the rich, which has a detrimental effect on the poor and working class.
