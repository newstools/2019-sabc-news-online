Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu says fighting corruption is one of the cardinal pillars of their election manifesto which was launched in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria at the weekend. On Saturday, thousands of EFF supporters attended the party’s election manifesto launch. Other issues on the EFF election manifesto list were land and unemployment in the country. The party’s deputy president has been linked to the VBS saga through his younger brother, Brian Shivambu. But despite this, Shivambu says they will not relent in ensuring that those who are involved in corruption are not allowed to hold positions of power. The party has also promised its supporters that it will pass legislation that will make all public representatives and civil servants lose their pension funds and savings if they are found guilty of corruption. The red berets also pledged to return land to black people regardless of the social status.-Additional reporting by Tshepiso Moche Click below for more… <a href="https://iono.fm/e/650983">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
