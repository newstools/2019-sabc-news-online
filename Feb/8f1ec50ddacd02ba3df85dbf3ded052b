The late African National Congress (ANC) Veterans League Deputy President, Bonisile Philemon Norushe has been hailed for his immense contribution towards development and liberation of the country. Norushe was laid to rest at his rural homestead in Keiskammahoek in the Eastern Cape. He died two weeks ago after a short illness. He was accorded a provincial official funeral. His colleagues described the former uMkhonto weSizwe militant as an extra ordinary patriot who served the country with distinction. ANC veterans league’s Snuki Zikalala says:”You left us when our movement has taken a bold step to confront corruption and state capture. We will not disappoint you. We commit to build a strong and united veterans league that will help build a strong ANC and prosperous South Africa.” Eastern Cape Acting Premier Oscar Mabuyane says:”After learning that Norushe was hospitalised we had hoped for his speedy recovery, we had hoped to share another moment with him, we had hoped to tap into his wisdom. However fate had its otherwise. Today we mourn a leader who never wavered.” The family also shared memories of his selfless life. Daughter Thokozani Norushe says:”I saw my daddy few days before he passed away and I was so devastated that I could see his situation, he was giving me a hint that his time was near.” Norushe is survived by his wife and children.
