The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape says it will not wait for the court outcome on the allegation that its Ward Councillor abducted and raped a 14-year-old mentally-ill girl in Kimberley. The party says it will look into the matter. Police say the 46-year-old man held two women hostage over two days at a house that was built for veterans. The man is charged with abduction, rape and attempted rape and is expected to appear in the local Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. The ANC’s Deshi Ngxanga says such allegations can harm the image of the party. “We believe that if you are a public representative, you should desist from any action that will bring the name of the ANC into disrepute. As for the ANC, we will be meeting with the regional leadership of the ANC here, talk and raise this matter with them, and in fact agree on a way forward. But surely, we will have to take stringent action and ensure we deal with this matter. We can’t wait for the outcome of a court. We should be proactive because this thing is now denting the image of the ANC.”
