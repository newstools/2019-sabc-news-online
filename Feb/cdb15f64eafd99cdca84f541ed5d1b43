Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert McBride is heading back to the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday morning to fight for his job. McBride wants the court to set aside Police Minister Bheki Cele’s decision not to renew his contract as head of IPID. Cele has reportedly argued that his decision is not cast in stone and it’s up to Parliament to make the appointment. In 2015, Mcbride successfully
challenged an invalid decision by former Police Minister Nathi Nhleko to
suspend him. Cele has written to Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police, proposing that McBride’s five-year contract not be renewed. McBride says the Minister is acting unlawfully because the committee won’t have time to consider the matter before his contract ends. Related video click below:
