Western Cape police say allegations of assault levelled against police based in Nyanga will be investigated. On Friday 36-year-old Luthando Frans appeared in the Fezeka Community court in Gugulethu on charges of crimen injuria, assault and intimidation. Frans says he was arrested on Wednesday after admonishing police not to drive fast in the area. He has also laid a counter charge of assault against the police for allegedly breaking his arm. Provincial police spokesperson Novela Potelwa says they are aware of the allegations. He says parties involved in this matter have opened cases against each other. He says: ” We urge you to allow this process to unfold in order for the allegations to be tested and investigated. If any member of the SAPS in Nyanga is found to have brutally assaulted the complainant without provocation, decisive action will be taken as this would be in contravention of the SAPS Code of Conduct.”
