President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to announce more plans on how to solve Eskom’s power crisis on Thursday. The Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, told Parliament on Wednesday that the power utility needed a cash injection by April in order to survive. Eskom has implemented loadshedding for the past four days. It will implement Stage 2 loadshedding on Thursday starting from 08:00 until 22:00. Eskom is laden with more than R416 billion in debt, and is battling a shortage of capacity that is threatening to derail government plans to lift the sluggish economy. Ramaphosa said last week during his State of the Nation Address (SONA) that Eskom would be unbundled into three entities – generation, transmission and distribution under Eskom Holdings – although this idea has been met with resistance by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu).
