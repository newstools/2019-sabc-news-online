In a bid to address the drought crisis in the Eastern Cape, the Rural Development and Agrarian Reform Department has set aside an amount of R42-million. The fund will be distributed across
all districts to assist farmers, fixing of windmills, and boreholes for
livestock. MEC Xolile Nqatha says the hardest hit
districts include Amathole, Sarah Baartmaan and Alfred Nzo. Nqatha has also urged farmers and
communities who are battling with drought to report at their nearest offices. “We wish to express our deep concerns with the spell of drought that has affected our province as a result of climate change. Working together with the Department of Forestry and Agriculture nationally, we have allocated an amount of R42 Million to help farmers. We are doing this work with farmers so that our response can be in line with the needs of farmers.”
