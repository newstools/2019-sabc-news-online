ANC Women’s League, Young Women’s desk’s Precious Banda is calling for the ANC to suspend the party’s Head of Communications in the Presidency Zizi Kodwa. She says the African National Congress (ANC) must pursue the matter. Banda states that as young women’s desk, they support the victim in this difficult time. “We are calling on the woman to open a case of rape against Zizi Kodwa, and she must take legal route.” Meanwhile, police say no case has been opened against African National Congress (ANC) Head of Communications in the Presidency Kodwa following allegations of rape against him. On Saturday, the ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte told the media at Luthuli House that Kodwa’s accuser sent a letter to the ANC Secretary-General’s office and they had advised her to go to the police. The allegations against Kodwa come days after the party’s national spokesperson Pule Mabe was cleared of sexual harassment allegations made by his former personal assistant. The media spotlight is expected to be firmly focused on the rape allegations against Kodwa this week, which is expected to create problems for the ANC with the upcoming 2019 general elections in May.
