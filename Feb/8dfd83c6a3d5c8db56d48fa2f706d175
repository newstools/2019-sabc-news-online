Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says South Africans have the opportunity to vote for change and free themselves from what he terms the oppression of the governing African National Congress (ANC). He was delivering the party’s 2019 election manifesto at the Rand Stadium in Johannesburg, ahead of the May elections. Maimane has decried the state of the country under the ANC leadership saying the former liberation party has forgotten about the poor. Around 20 000 DA supporters from across the country attended the launch of the election manifesto. Maimane says they want to rekindle the dream of a better life for all that former president Nelson Mandela had promised. Maimane says the governing party which liberated the country has forgotten about the people because of their greed. The DA document which is titled “The Manifesto For Change – One South Africa For All” focuses on three pillars including economic growth and creating jobs and building a caring and opportunity-rich South Africa. Maimane says all corrupt politicians should be sent to jail for no less than 15 years. He says the late Helen Suzman laid the foundation for the values that the party stands for that of a united South Africa. The DA says it is ready to govern South Africa, and its readiness will be reflected in the manifesto. Maimane says although they celebrate the struggle icons the party must also celebrate the everyday heroes, ordinary South Africans who struggle to survive every day.
