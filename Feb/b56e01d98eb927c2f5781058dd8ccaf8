DA leader Mmusi Maimane says public resources have been looted by ANC politicians in many municipalities. He led a picket to the Free State Premier’s Office to hand over a memorandum demanding the provincial government to take immediate action against municipalities that have failed to pay Eskom. Maimane says the ANC led provincial governments cannot hire comrades and expect them to turn around municipalities. He says half of the money that is put in the municipalities has been stolen and that where the DA is in Government, it collects revenue and services are delivered to the people because the DA wants to build sustainable cities and municipalities. “Now we are demanding that municipalities that can be able to purchase directly from other sources of energy must be allowed to do so. If you can be able to purchase energy from a solar plant, you must do so immediately because if we all depend on Eskom, they will hold all of us at ransom as South Africa,” he adds.
