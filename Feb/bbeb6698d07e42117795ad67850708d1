The DA has unveiled a new billboard in the Johannesburg CBD that reads: “The ANC Has Killed The Lights”. The party accuses the ANC of being responsible for the current spate of load shedding in the country.  DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says, “It’s the ANC that has brought Eskom to its knees and they are the reason we have load shedding in SA. What we see is a government that’s incapable of transforming Eskom and turning it into an entity that can supply electricity in SA. So while the ANC are killing the lights – they are also killing jobs in SA, none of the job/economy targets mentioned at SONA are achievable while we have load shedding.” Last month, a DA billboard with the names of the Life Esidimeni victims, miners who were killed in the Marikana Massacre and children who’ve died after falling into pit toilets, was damaged after families of some of the deceased said they didn’t give permission to the political party to use the names.
