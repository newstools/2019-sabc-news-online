A suspected cash-in-transit robber is in police custody in
hospital following the bloody shootout with police in a heist at Nongoma in northern
KwaZulu-Natal a week ago. This emerged at the funeral of police Special Task Force member Erasmus Musa, who was shot dead in, together with Crime Intelligence colonel Carl Van Der Vyver. Seven robbers were killed in the shootout, while three got away. Police Minister Bheki Cele said after the funeral outside
Port Shepstone on the South Coast that the latest report on tracing the outstanding
suspects is promising. Cele wants them to be arrested within 24 hours.
