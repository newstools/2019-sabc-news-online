The Mokgoro Enquiry should completely disregard former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer Angelo Agrizzi‘s testimony. This is according to lawyers acting for suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. Agrizzi has changed his mind about testifying before the Mokgoro Enquiry. An affidavit of Agrizzi’s testimony has already been submitted to the enquiry.  The enquiry is probing the NPA advocates fitness to hold office. Agrizzi had made damning allegations against both Jiba and Mrwebi at the State Capture Commission. There he testified that the two NPA advocates had received monthly bribes between R10 000 and R100 000 to halt investigations into Bosasa officials. Following that testimony Agrizzi was called to appear before the Mokgoro Enquiry. While he initially agreed, Agrizzi has since made a U-turn saying that he received legal advice against giving testimony at the Mokgoro Enquiry. He was arrested shortly after his disclosures at the State Capture Commission. The advocates are accused of maladministration and misconduct for their alleged mishandling of high profile cases. “The evidence of Agrizzi must be disregarded completely. It cannot be right and just for these allegations to be left hanging… my client has been labelled a snake due to Agrizzi. Our client is extremely displeased by these turn of events. Advocate Jiba was willing to address these allegations,” says Jiba’s legal Representative Advocate Zola Majavu.
