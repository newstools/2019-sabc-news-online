The South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) condemns the blocking of journalists by Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams from covering the actions of protestors at an ANC manifesto launch in Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape. SANEF has seen the video footage which was also broadcast on
television stations showing the minister preventing the journalists from
covering the protest and ordering them to cover what they came for and not give
coverage to “people that are out of order”. Furious supporters stormed the rally complaining about poor
service delivery. Journalists from the SABC and other media were among those
blocked. The organisation says while they note the Minister has
apologised for the incident, they are concerned that she refers to her actions
as an “altercation”. Given the Minister’s high profile portfolio relating in
particular to the SABC, we would like to have an urgent meeting with her to
discuss the matter and our concerns. SANEF salute the SABC for airing the footage, showing fierce
editorial independence and a shift from the recent past where freedom of
expression was undermined at the public broadcaster. SANEF held its council meeting on Saturday and ahead of
elections it is calling on party leaders to allow the media to do its work
without fear or favour and ensure the safety of journalists at their events. SANEF is concerned that attacks against journalists are
escalating and calls on political parties and those elected to lead not to use
journalists as pawns in their political infighting or to cover up corruption. In the run up to the
elections highly contested hot spots often pose a threat to the safety of
journalists. SANEF will be holding elections workshops in all nine provinces focusing on elections coverage, ethics and fighting fake news.
