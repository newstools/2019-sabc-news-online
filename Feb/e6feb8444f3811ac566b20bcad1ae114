The IEC has postponed two by-elections that were meant to be held in wards 35 and 37 in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro to the 6th of March. The wards in the Northern Areas became vacant after the DA expelled councillors Trevor Louw and Neville Higgins, after they defied the party’s advise not to attend a council meeting. The two have since appealed their expulsion in the Grahamstown High Court. Provincial Electoral Officer, Khayakazi Magudumane says they’ll await the outcome of the appeal. “The appeal has an effect of restoring the situation to that which existed before Judge Reveres made the order. In order words the two councillors remain councillors until such time the appeal is decided. The report of the IEC is that there are no vacancies and thus no by-elections to administer.”
