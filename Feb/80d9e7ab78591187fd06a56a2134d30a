With another very hot day predicted for Durban, KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Rescue Services spokesperson Robert McKenzie has cautioned that especially children, the sick and the elderly should drink enough fluids. A maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius is expected in Durban on Tuesday. This after temperatures have been in the high twenties for a number of days. McKenzie says Durban’s high humidity and the UV index will add to discomfort levels. He has urged people to try and stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day. “People are advised to stay out of the heat during the heat of the day, which is between 10 and about 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Also, please stay well hydrated, by drinking plenty of fluid. The average adult needs to drink about 2 litres of water a day to stay well hydrated. Also don’t forget children are also at risk when they are at school. So make sure that they have taken enough water juice to school and refill their juice bottles at school so that they stay well hydrated.”
