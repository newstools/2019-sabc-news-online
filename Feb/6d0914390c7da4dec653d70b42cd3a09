Newly-elected Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, announced his members during a media briefing in Pretoria. The MMCs will prioritise service delivery and deal with the scourge of cable theft in Tshwane. But uncertainty continues to rock the mayor’s office over the embattled City Manager’s future and the illegal R12 billion Glad-Africa tender. Barely a week in office and Mokgalapa continues where his predecessor, Solly Msimanga, left off. His team has four new members, the rest are from Msimanga’s committee. Enhancing service delivery their biggest mandate. But outside, two protests demanding exactly that. Mokgalapa also has the difficult task of dealing with the irregular multi-billion rand Glad Africa tender and the future of City Manager, Dr Moketse Mosola, who allegedly awarded the fraudulent tender but Mokgalapa is playing his cards close to his chest. As the country waits with bated breath to hear what Mokgalapa’s plans are on the illegal Glad-Africa contract and Mosola’s fate. Speculation is rife that he will opt to save the embattled City Manager in a bid to calm political tensions in his party and minimise the political onslaught from opposition parties.
