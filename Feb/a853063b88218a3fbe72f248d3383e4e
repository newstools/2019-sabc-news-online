The African National Congress (ANC) has apologised to two of his senior members. The ANC extends an unreserved apology to both Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan and the ANC head of Organizing Comrade Senzo Mchunu, after the party has established that their remarks were taken out of context. The ANC acknowledges the importance of constructive engagement with all professionals including black engineers and the Black Management Forum. “The ANC believes that it is important to have such engagements on an ongoing basis in order to discuss issues of mutual interest and find a common ground,” the statement reads. It says the ANC, within its structures, has a wide range of progressive professional bodies and has worked very hard to build and maintain the progressive and revolutionary relationships. The ANC promises to meet with the black professionals in the coming week and to engage on issues of mutual interest.
