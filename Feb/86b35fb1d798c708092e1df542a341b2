Conjoined twin boys born in Yemen who were in urgent need of
treatment abroad died on Saturday, the health ministry in Houthi-controlled
Yemen said overnight. Doctors treating two-week-old Abd al-Khaleq and Abd
al-Rahimin the capital Sanaa had said the boys could not survive within Yemen’s
war-ravaged health system and needed to be taken abroad. But the airport in Houthi-controlled Sanaa has been closed to
civilian flights since 2015 because the Saudi-led coalition has control over
Yemeni airspace. Only UN planes can land there currently and re-opening the
airport is a key aim of UN-led peace talks which began with negotiations in
Stockholm in December. A Saudi organisation, the King Salman Center for Relief and Humanitarian
Works, had been looking into how to get the boys abroad for treatment, Saudi
state news agency SPA said on Wednesday. The tiny boys had separate heads but a shared torso. In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Saba news, the health
ministry said the deaths reflect the health and humanitarian situation Yemen’s
children are living through as a result of the war. Yemen’s almost four-year war pits the Iran-aligned Houthi movement
against a Saudi-backed coalition trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu
Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, collapsed
the economy and brought millions of people to the brink of famine.
