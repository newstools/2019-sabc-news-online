Eskom says it may have to implement stage one loadshedding from 14:00pm until 22:00pm on Thursday night. In a statement, the power utility says the move is due to a shortage of generating capacity. It has warned that there is also a strong possibility of load shedding for Friday and at the weekend. This is because Eskom needs to replenish emergency diesel and water reserves.
