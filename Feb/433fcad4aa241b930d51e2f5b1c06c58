Suspended National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates Lawrence Mrwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba will finally tell their side of the story when they take the witness stand at the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria on Wednesday. This comes after weeks of damning testimony against Mrwebi and Jiba by multiple witnesses. The Mokgoro Enquiry is investigating the fitness to hold office of both Jiba and Mrwebi. They are accused of misconduct and mishandling high profile cases. Testimonies from current to former colleagues have painted a crippling picture of political interference and dubious prosecutorial decisions by the pair. One of the key cases is the controversial withdrawal by Mrwebi â€“ of charges against former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. This was according to North Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi during his testimony on the stand.
