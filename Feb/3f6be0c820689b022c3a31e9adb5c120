The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), has announced that it will embark on a secondary strike in the platinum sector over job cuts. Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa has called on its members at Sibanye-Stillwaterâ€™s platinum operations to down tools over job cuts and wages. Last week, Sibanye-Stillwater said that it could cut nearly 6 000 jobs in its effort to restructure its gold mining operations. During a media briefing in Johannesburg, Mathunjwa also lambasted Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe, saying he had shown no interest in engaging with the union. Mathunjwa says Mantashe is more concerned about the illegal miners trapped a the Gloria Coal Mine than retrieving the bodies of the three mineworkers at the Lily Mine that have still not been recovered since 2016 following an underground collapse.
