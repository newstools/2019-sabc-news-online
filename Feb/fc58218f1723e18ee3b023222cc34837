A Solar Park in Kathu in the Northern Cape is now operating commercially and is expected to supply energy to more than 170 000 houses around the province. The R12 billion Solar Park is in line with government’s
vision to drive renewable energy in to the country’s energy mix. Regional Managing Director of SENER Southern Africa, which
contributed in the construction of the Solar Park Siyabonga Mbanjwa, says this
was urgent for the country. “South Africa largely relying on coal for its
production of electricity needed to look at finding alternative ways of
generating electricity. A few years ago, loadshedding was starting to have a
negative impact on economic growth. There was an urgent need to find cleaner
ways of generating electricity and for us to be able to get additional
megawatts on to the grid,” says Mbanjwa.
