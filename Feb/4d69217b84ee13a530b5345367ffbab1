The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it
has resorted to Wednesday’s nationwide strike against job losses because
government has been refusing to sign the minimum service delivery agreement. The labour federation says as a result, workers are being unfairly retrenched. Cosatu has called on all workers in the country to join its
national strike. In Johannesburg, the march will start at the Mary Fitzgerald Square around 10am on Wednesday morning. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla says, “We have been discussing the issue of the minimum service delivery agreement since 2007 strike. It is [the] government that has been refusing to sign that, so we have exhausted that process. Until they come back and sign on the dotted line so that we know how many of the workers do we leave behind.”
