Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams  on Saturday met with the task team working on the recapitalisation of the SABC. The team sought to provide the Minister with a progress update as she prepares to pursue Cabinet approval for the allocation of a SABC government bailout. This will enable the public broadcaster to normalise operations and position it for a turnaround. The Public Broadcaster has been in a dire financial crisis, with senior management reporting late last year that the organisation wont be able to pay salaries after March 2019. The SABC said at the time it had to retrench over 1000 full-time employees to reduce its heavy wage bill. However, the SABC announced in January that it has decided not to renew the notice to invoke Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act. The team tasked with the recapitalisation comprises of senior officials from the Department of Communications, National Treasury and the SABC. Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams appreciated the progress made and reiterated to the team that restoring the SABC’s financial sustainability is of vital importance as this will enable it to deliver on its public service mandate to inform, educate and entertain. Further noting the corporate governance issues emanating from an inquorate board. The Minister indicated that whilst Section 13 (1) of the Broadcasting Act of 1999 as amended, provides that “non-executive members of the board must be appointed by the President on the advice of the National Assembly,” she will, in terms of her shareholder responsibilities, continue engaging Parliament to bring finality to this matter. The Minister lastly reiterated her unreserved apology for the incident involving SABC journalists, amongst others.
