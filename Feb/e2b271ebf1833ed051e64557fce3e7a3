CEO of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) Professor Eddy Maloka says there has been great improvement in issues of good governance in Africa. Maloka was speaking on the backdrop of the meeting of the African Union (AU) taking place in Ethiopia. Heads of state and government representatives are gathering for the summit, which this year, has a special focus on the refugee crisis. They will discuss issues like the rising challenge of refugees and internally displaced persons following conflicts in some parts of Africa. Maloka says the APRM will be presenting a governance report â€“ the first time such a report is being presented in the AU. He says though there has been great strides made in governance, there is still stagnation in political governance. For more watch below:
