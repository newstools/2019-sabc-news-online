The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee says internal party squabbles in the North West may affect its performance at the 8th May general elections. The national leadership has disbanded the Supra Mahumapelo-led Provincial Executive Committee, and now the Job Mokgoro-led Provincial Task Team or PTT. Both committees have been replaced by an interim structure, led by NEC members Obed Bapela and Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, as convener and coordinator, respectively. The newly-established Provincial Task Team (PTT) says it’s now working to uniting the factions in the province. “We are worried as the African National Congress. The polls also are indicating that North West is one of the marginal provinces. And we know that North West used to be one of the biggest deliverer of the African National Congress, hence this intervention; hence the appeal to comrades and leaders that are in these fights, to say ‘suspend everything, let’s work together for the elections.’ That was the message coming through. And that, any major challenges that are there, we are not setting them aside, we are just postponing them,” says  Bapela.
