Executive Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, Mongameli Bobani, will on Thursday face another no confidence vote, which gets underway in Port Elizabeth council chambers in the Eastern Cape. The urgent motion of no confidence in Bobani has been submitted by councillor Marlon Daniels of the Patriotic Alliance (PA). Daniels is expected to vote with the Democratic Alliance (DA), Congress of the People (COPE) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP). Bobani survived his first motion of no confidence in November 2018. “Bobani does not consult with the rest of the coalition partners. Bobani is quite okay with the fact that Andile Lungisa from the ANC publicly stated he is the actual mayor of the Metro and evidently, so we know that Bobani takes instruction from Lungisa and in this regard the rest of coalition partners. That was not part of the script; it was not part of the agreement and the Patriotic Alliance said, we shall never allow the ANC to lead this Metro,” says Daniels. Several attempts to get comment from Bobani were unsuccessful. Political Analyst at the Nelson Mandela University (NMU), Ongama Mtika, says the motion results will give an important indication as to whether the coalition is still united.
