Former Acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko says Stage 4 loadshedding that was recently experienced across the country is due to gross incompetence at the power utility’s top level. Eskom implemented the most severe stage of loadshedding after it unexpectedly lost six additional generating units. It has now managed to obtain emergency diesel, to help ease the current energy crisis. The rolling blackouts left several South Africans fuming, but Eskom says the chance of loadshedding is low, for now. Koko, who headed Eskom’s Generation, has questioned how leaders at the power utility failed to foresee the crisis. “For an organisation that is 95-years old, it cannot be that you get into Stage 4 loadshedding that is unprecedented and no one in the organisation saw it coming. Eskom has given you many reasons for why we have loadshedding. I bet you that tomorrow we will have more loadshedding and the reasons will be different. We’ve had reasons such as the coal quality from the Guptas, state capture, the coal stock, the breakdowns and now we are hearing new stories about Medupi and Kusile. This points out to a leadership that just does not know what is wrong with its business.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/655906">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on videos below:   <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
