President Cyril Ramaphosa says he hopes the Northern Cape will increase its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The province only contributes 2% to the country’s GDP which is the lowest by any province in South Africa. Ramaphosa was delivering the keynote address at the opening of the over R21 billion investment Gamsberg Mine near Aggeneys in the Northern Cape. “We are impressed with the way the mine is run; the way that it got established and the people who work in it. All of you are well-skilled in what you do. You know your craft and after all as miners you do everything so well, so precisely. We are very very pleased to be here. We are particularly proud because operation is one of the most investment drives that we have been on to.”
