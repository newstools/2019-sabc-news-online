At least 17 people died on Tuesday as
a fire tore through a budget hotel in Delhi before dawn, in the latest disaster
to raise concerns over fire safety in India. The fire broke out at the Hotel Arpit
Palace in a congested part of central Delhi, with images showing it engulfing
the entire top floor. “We have confirmed with hospital authorities, the toll is now 17 including a child,” Sunil Choudhary, a fire brigade official said. Local media reports said a woman and child
died as they tried to escape by jumping from a window. G.C. Misra, Delhi fire brigade
director, said the blaze had been brought under control and that 35 people were
rescued by fire-fighters in an operation lasting several hours. “There was wooden panelling on corridors
because of which people could not use corridors to evacuate,” another fire
officer told reporters. Images showed thick smoke and flames
billowing out of the top floor of four-storey hotel, popular with budget
travellers. Police said they were investigating
the cause. The blaze was extinguished in the
early hours with the help of at least 25 fire engines, with the top floors
being gutted. Fires are common across India because
of poor safety standards and lax enforcement of regulations. Activists say builders and landlords
often cut corners on safety to save costs and have accused civic authorities of
negligence and apathy. Fire disasters are particularly
frequent in Mumbai, India’s financial capital where millions live in cramped
and dilapidated properties because of high rents. In December, eight people were killed
when a fire engulfed a hospital in Mumbai. In 2017, 14 people were killed, also
in Mumbai, when a huge blaze tore through a popular restaurant.
