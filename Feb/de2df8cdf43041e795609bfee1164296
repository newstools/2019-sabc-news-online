Five of the seven suspects linked to fraud, corruption and money laundering involving Correctional Services tenders will appear in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes court Wednesday afternoon. The suspects aged between 50 and 78 were arrested by the Hawks Wednesday morning. The Hawks say the arrests follow a marathon investigation. The Hawks say almost R1.6 billion was misappropriated in tender irregularities involving Bosasa. Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi spent nine-days at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture detailing how the company and its subsidiaries bribed Correctional Services officials, laundered millions of rand and rigged tenders in their favour. Former President Thabo Mbeki signed a proclamation for the SIU to launch a probe into Bosasa dealings with the Department in 2007. The 2009 SIU report, which was never acted on, found wrongdoing on Bosasaâ€™s part, and some Correctional Services officials. Correctional Services officials and their families benefited financially from tenders awarded to Bosasa. The Head of the Hawks, Godfrey Lebea has welcomed the arrests.
