Learners will not return to class on Wednesday morning at Hoërskool Driehoek, as the Gauteng Department of Education still awaits the structural report from the Department of Labour, which is expected to be handed over today. Four learners died and 20 others were seriously injured when a cement walkway collapsed on them last Friday. The Gauteng Department of Education says it will make a final decision on the reopening of the school once they receive a structural safety report from the Department of Labour, later today. On Tuesday night, parents met with school management as well as officials from the Gauteng Department of Education at a local church to get an update on the incident. Spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “Probably at the latest, next week Monday – but we will confirm after we have perused the report from the structural engineers that we have already appointed as the Department of Education.” Funeral services of the three learners, who died at the school on Friday, will be held on Thursday and Friday this week.
