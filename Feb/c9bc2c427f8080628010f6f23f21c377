Robert McBride is no longer the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. This after Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police recommended that his contract should not be renewed. McBride has since launched urgent court interdict to have his term extended. The committee had to consider whether McBride should remain in the position or not. This follows Police Minister Bheki Cele‘s decision not to renew McBride’s contract. McBride took Cele to court saying only Parliament had the power to decide whether his contract should be renewed or not. Thursday was the deadline for the committee to report back to the High Court in Pretoria on the matter. African National Congress Member of Parliament Leonard Ramatlakane explains, “The committee has concluded that the appointment of the ED of IPID Robert McBride should not be renewed for further term.” Watch related videos:
