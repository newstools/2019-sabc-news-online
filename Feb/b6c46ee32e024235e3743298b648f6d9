The president of the African People’s Convention (APC) has committed to the nationalisation of land and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) among other pledges in its election manifesto on Saturday. The party’s leader Themba Godi was addressing supporters in Mninginisi village, outside Giyani, Limpopo. Godi started his address by acknowledging contributions by struggle icons and emphasised that the APC believes that socialism is the solution for the attainment of happiness and well-being of the African nation and the working class. In its manifesto, the APC commits to improve infrastructure, employment and to prioritize agriculture and mining. “There will be a standardisation of farm sizes for substinence farming, small and large scale commercial farming. No individual will have more than one farm, however, co-operatives can be allocated more than one farm on account of their production excellence…The APC will ensure that strategic minerals are in the hands of the State through total ownership or in partnership with private companies,” says Godi. Scores of supporters have gathered in a local sport stadium for the launch of the manifesto ahead of the May general elections.
