The mother of the baby boy, who was found dumped on medical waste at the King Edward Hospital in Durban, has arrived at the Durban Magistrateâ€™s Court. The 20-year-old woman is set to appear in court on a charge of attempted murder. She gave birth to the infant at the hospital prematurely. The child was kept in hospital in order to give it a chance to gain weight. The baby boy survived the ordeal and is still in hospital. In an earlier incident, a baby girl was rescued from a storm water pipe in Newlands East, north of Durban, after being trapped for hours.
