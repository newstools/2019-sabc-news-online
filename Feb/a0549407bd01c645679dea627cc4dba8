Parliament is working on introducing into law the Aarto demerit system to help regulate road users for traffic safety. Chairperson of Parliament’s Transport Portfolio Committee Dikeledi Magadzi, says the process started in 2016 and passed the legislation in November 2017 at the National Assembly, which then went to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). “The first issue which the National Council of Provinces indicated to us as the Portfolio Committee was that we cannot say when there is dispute and when there is a tribunal. We give it a time frame because you don’t know when the panel of the Tribunal will be able to sit and deal with the challenges that are there in terms of the dispute,” says Magadzi. Magazi says the legislation has been improved from previous demerit systems and believes it will improve South African road safety.
