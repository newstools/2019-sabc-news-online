Two people have died and 29 others have been injured in a crash on the N4 near Valentia Park in Nelspruit on Saturday night. Two minibus-taxis collided head on, in what has been described by paramedics as a horror crash. ER24â€™s Ross Campbell says when emergency services arrived on scene, they found four people still entrapped in the wreckage of the vehicles. Two of the entrapped showed no signs of life and were declared dead on arrival. The two critical patients needed to be extracted by rescue services before being treated with Advanced Life Support interventions. Campbell says 29 adult patients in total, with injuries ranging from moderate to serious were treated on scene and then transported to Barberton hospital as well to a private hospital in the area. Police were on scene for further investigations.
