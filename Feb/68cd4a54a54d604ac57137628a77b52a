Former Sol Plaatje Municipality Speaker and ANC member Elizabeth Johnson has accused the ANC in the Northern Cape of failing her, hence her decision to become a member of the newly formed GOOD party. The former speaker accuses the party of protecting the then Mayor of the Municipality – Mangaliso Matika’s – corrupt activities and overriding her complaint that he made her job impossible through his sexual advances. She says she was fired as speaker and
party member allegedly after she refused to table and approve a budget that she
believed had financial discrepancies. “I refused any corrupt activities, I was in his was, so must remove me. He wanted a relationship with me. You can’t give someone money and say come to my place then he start to kiss me, I did not agree with that. I did go to the police station and did an affidavit.” Click on audio below:
