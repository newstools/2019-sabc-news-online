President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers his annual State of the National Address. This is his second since the recall of former President Jacob Zuma in February last year and the last for the fifth Parliament. Extracts from President Ramaphosa’s SONA Ramaphosa started his State of the Nation address in Parliament without any interruptions. Rampahosa kicked off his speech by calling on all South Africans to reflect on the journey of the last 25 years. Ramaphosa said he is committed to building a South Africa where injustices of the past no longer defined the living conditions of South Africans. The President says 2019 should be a year of reflection for South Africa on the progress made and mistakes that were committed in recent years. Soon after taking the reins last year, Ramaphosa channelled the late Hugh Masekela by adopting the phrase “Thuma Mina” (send me) as his manifesto. He says South Africans have embraced government’s message of renewal following tumultuous years. “We must use this time to reflect on the progress we have made, the challenges we have encountered, the setbacks we have suffered, and the mistakes we have committed. A year ago, we set out on a path of growth and renewal.  Emerging from a period of uncertainty and a loss of confidence and trust, we resolved to break with all that divides us, to embrace all that unites us.  We resolved to cure our country of the corrosive effects of corruption and to restore the integrity of our institutions.”
