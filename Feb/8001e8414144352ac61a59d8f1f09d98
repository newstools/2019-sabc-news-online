The Kings and Queens Funeral Services has labelled as a ‘hoax’ – an incident in which a Johannesburg based pastor claimed to have raised a man from the dead. A video showing Pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia Ministries, went viral on social media – after he claimed to be praying for a dead man who he then resurrected. The Kings and Queens Funeral Service’s vehicle was used to ferry the alleged deceased man to the church. The funeral service’s spokesperson, Giyani Dube, explains their version of Sunday’s incident. “The incident is shocking. There is nothing whatsoever that amounts to a miracle. That was a hoax. We urge the listeners not to be duped into such scams. As Kings and Queens, we did not have that body in our mortuary. We only came in as service providers to provide them with a hearse which they requested from us. The very person who acted as a dead person was identified by the people who were inside another quantum before this drama took place. He was there alive.” Three funeral parlours have announced that they have approached the police to investigate the matter. The companies have been criticised for their alleged involvement in the incident. The companies say they are victims of misrepresentations by the so-called Prophet who wanted to display his would-be supernatural powers.   Click on video below:
