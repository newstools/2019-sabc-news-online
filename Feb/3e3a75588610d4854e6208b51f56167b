Motorists are advised to avoid Allandale road between Dale road and Modderfontein road in Midrand north of Johannesburg, due to an on-going protest. Protesters have completely closed Allandale road with burning tyres and rocks. It’s believed the protest is over water related issues.  Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says police have been deployed to the area. “Motorists are advised to avoid that area for now. There was a protest there, also last night. They say they were not having water or adequate water. So motorists are advised to avoid that area for now.  Officers are on the scene managing the situation.”
