The positions of North West mayors, whose municipalities invested illegally with the controversial VBS Mutual Bank, are still safe. This comes as the newly-established ANC Provincial Task Team says it has suspended a decision to remove them and will instead focus on preparing for the May elections. The implicated municipalities include, Madibeng, Mahikeng, Moretele and Dr Ruth Segomotsi District. Convenor for the newly-established PTT, Obed Bapela, says: “The ANC has advised that let’s not touch municipalities, let’s not touch government. We must focus on the election campaign.” “Where there are issues, the convener, the coordinator and the NEC members who are deployed to the North West, will attend to those issues and advise the Rapid Response accordingly.” Related Video
