United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader General Bantu Holomisa has challenged President Cyril Ramaphosa to act on cabinet ministers that are implicated by former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer, Angelo Agrizzi. Agrizzi testified at the Zondo Commission that is investigating state capture. Speaking on the sidelines of his party’s meeting in Durban, Holomisa was welcoming new members to the party. Holomisa says the ball is in President Ramaphosa’s court to act on the Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe and Environmental Affairs Minister, Nomvula Monkonyane. This follows Agrizzi’s explosive testimony about bribes and kickbacks for contracts that were given to cabinet ministers and high-ranking public servants. “When you deal with public representative, sometimes you don’t have to prove beyond doubt. Balance of probability is always sufficient to take a decision or act. President Ramaphosa has got those powers. So, he wants to be associated with looters and thieves … it is his own business,” says Holomisa. Holomisa then shifted focus to preparations for the 2019’s general elections. He has welcomed about 400 new members whom he says are coming from different political parties. Among them was former National Freedom Party National Executive Committee member Sindi Maphumulo-Mashinini who parted ways with the NFP last week. Holomisa says the UDM is still a force to be reckoned with. “It means that the UDM is growing. Secondly, it also means that the people of KZN are becoming free in these days  because in the past there were certain areas here that were known to be no-go areas and if you join another party then you are in trouble. But it shows that democracy is maturing in this province.” Meanwhile, the UDM will launch its election manifesto in East London, Eastern Cape, in February. Click below for more on the story:
