The CRL Commission says pastors who claim to stage miracles, defy the laws of nature by alleging that they can resurrect people from the dead, do so to mislead people into giving church leaders money. This follows an incident in which a Johannesburg based pastor claimed to have raised a man from the dead on Sunday. A video showing Pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia Ministries has gone viral on social media – after he claimed to be praying for a dead man who then resurrected. The funeral parlour, whose vehicle was used to ferry the alleged deceased man to the church, has labelled the incident as a ‘hoax’. The Deputy Chairperson of the CRL commission, Prof David Mosoma says, “Resurrection means suspension of the laws of nature. When somebody claims to have suspended the laws of nature when someone has passed on, it means there must be credible witnesses, a certification that the person is dead, the person must be in a registered morgue. The morgue must certify that this person is dead. All of these things are the questions we are asking ourselves, how did this happen? We have discovered that there are no such things as miracles. They are made up to try to get money from the hopelessness of our people. We cannot allow our people to be abused in this way.” Watch related videos:
