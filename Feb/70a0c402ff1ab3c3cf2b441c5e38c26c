A report by the AFP news agency has found that a spreadsheet that has gone viral on social media in Nigeria is in fact a fake. A screenshot of the spreadsheet, which claims to be from the Nigerian Electoral Commission, has been shared by more than six-thousand people on Facebook and Twitter. It shows that Atiku Abubakar of the opposition PDP Party was actually the victor in the 2019 general election. The ‘Hope For Nigeria’ Facebook page, which is notorious for spreading misinformation, first circulated the image. The image was also shared by Eunice Atuejide, the presidential candidate of the National Interest Party (NIP). According to official INEC figures, President Muhammadu Buhari won the election. This result was verified by various local and international election observers.
