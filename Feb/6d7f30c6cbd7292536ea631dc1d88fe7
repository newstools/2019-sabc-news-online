The runner-up in Senegal’s presidential election has accepted the outcome of the vote in which President Macky Sall has been named the victor. Opposition candidate Idrissa Seck, says will not appeal the election results. Earlier Seck, along with the three other candidates, had disputed the results. President Macky Sall faced four challengers in his bid for a second term. Official provisional results show Sall winning a clear victory with 58.27 percent of votes. Former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck came in second with 20.5 percent. Sall’s victory in the first round is a blow to the opposition. Just hours after polls closed Sunday Seck declared a run-off inevitable citing unofficial tallies by opposition parties. Candidates have 72 hours to challenge the provisional result in court.
