The SABC says it’s in the process of reviewing the freelance contracts of on-air talent which will expire in March. In 2018, the public broadcaster implemented Section 189 of the constitution to facilitate the retrenchment 981 employees and end the contracts of 1 200 freelancers. The proposed cuts were met with political and civil resistance. They were halted after the resignation of several board members, despite warnings that without job cuts or a financial bailout of approximately R6.8 billion, it would be unable to pay salaries by April. SABC Spokesperson, Neo Momodu, says current contract reviews and negotiations are nothing new. “This is an annual process, which takes place in February and March and is informed by various factors such as revenue, audience performance of the specific programmes, return on investment, as well as the strategic direction of the various platforms. SABC management is currently engaging with radio and sport freelance on-air talent about their respective contracts which are expiring on the 31st of March 2019. The SABC remains committed to ensuring its platforms provide relevant and compelling content while ensuring growth in audience and revenue.”
