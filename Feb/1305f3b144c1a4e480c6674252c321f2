Teacher union SAOU has warned of another impending school disaster in the wake of the Hoërskool Driehoek tragedy. A total of 18 classrooms at Hoërskool Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg, are not being used due to their extreme state of dilapidation. The union says the school has already been issued with a notice by the City of Johannesburg’s Development Planning Department for contravention of the National Building and Buildings Standards Act. SAOU says an engineering company employed by the school found that the classroom floors had sagged and there were visible cracks on the reinforced concrete floors. It has also been found that the three-storey building, where classes are located, pose a danger to learners. SAOU spokesperson Johan Kruger says they have written letters to the Gauteng Education Department to intervene. He says: “I wrote a letter to the MEC last week, I didn’t get any response from Mr Lesufi. On Tuesady, we wrote him another letter but up to this stage no response from the MEC. As an interim measure, they have to put temporary classes there at the school. That is the only thing I can see that can assist the situation.”
