The South African Teacher’s Union says they fully support their member at San Souci Girls’ High School in Cape Town, who was seen slapping a Grade 9 learner in a video that had gone viral on social media. CEO of the union, Chris Klopper, says
should the teacher need representation, in either a disciplinary or criminal
process, they will undertake that representation if permitted to do so. “We’re fully aware of the fact that she is employed by the school’s governing body and as such that disciplinary processes may emanate from her employee-employer relationship. We intend to represent the teacher, Clarissa Venter, in those disciplinary processes. We’ve also appointed external legal advisors to take responsibility for any other possible criminal procedures that may emanate from this.” Click on video below: Students protesting in support of teacher:
