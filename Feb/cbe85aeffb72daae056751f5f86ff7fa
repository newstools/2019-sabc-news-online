International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, says South Africa is hopeful that elections will go well in Nigeria this coming Saturday. This comes after the Electoral Commission in Nigeria postponed the elections five hours before polling stations were due to open last weekend. Nigerians have expressed disappointment with political parties blaming each other for the postponement. It is business as usual in Nigeria, but there is still no clear explanation why the elections were postponed. Candidates are again allowed to campaign. The elections are scheduled to take place on Saturday. South Africa says while there may be concerns, this is not the first time the country has changed the election date. Sisulu says, “Nigeria has previously postponed their elections and when this happened, Nigerians have accepted and are waiting patiently for Saturday to cast their ballots.” Pretoria is hopeful that Nigerians will participate in elections to strengthen democracy on the continent. “Nigeria is one of the important countries and is expected that all will go well. But, we haven’t gotten any information on why elections were postponed.” The international community is monitoring the situation in Nigeria with keen interest. Another country in West Africa that will go to the polls this weekend is Senegal. And also South Africa will go to the polls in May. Minister Sisulu says all South African diplomatic missions abroad are prepared for the elections. “Our missions are ready to receive those living abroad for that day. They will be voting. We’ve done it before. So, this is not a new venture for us.” The continent will see 15 countries head to the ballot box in 2019.  Related video, click below:
