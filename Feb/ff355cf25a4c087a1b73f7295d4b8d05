Free State premier Sisi Ntombela will deliver her first State of the Province Addresses (Sopa) at Vista Arena in Bloemfontein on Tuesday morning. It will be the first time she will outline programmes and plans of the province since she took over from the former premier Ace Magashule in April 2018. Ntombela is also expected to highlight the province’s performance in the last year administration ahead of this year’s general elections. The province has experienced service delivery protests in different areas and the Estina dairy corruption case was also one of the highlights in 2018. She is expected to touch on education, health care system and dysfunctional municipalities in the province. Opposition parties have already expressed concerns on lack of action from the Premier’s office. The Democratic Alliance (DA) made the alternative state of province address where it highlighted the crisis in health care system, lack of economic growth and corruption among others. Ntombela will deliver her first and the last state of the province address before general elections in May.
