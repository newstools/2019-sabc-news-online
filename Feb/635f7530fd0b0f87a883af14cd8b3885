The Mokgoro Enquiry, which began six weeks ago, has concluded its hearings in Pretoria. It will hand its recommendations to President Cyril Ramaphosa in two weeks’ time. Ramaphosa established the enquiry to investigate the fitness of suspended senior NPA advocates Lawrence Mrwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba to hold office. This followed allegations that they mishandled high profile corruption cases amid political interference. The cases included that of former Crime Intelligence boss, Richard Mdluli. The enquiry’s spokesperson, Bongiwe Gambu, explains the way forward. “What’s going to happen next is that the evidence leading team is going to submit its own arguments and they’ve a deadline of next week Tuesday and after that; the panel will sit down with their notes and all the information that have been submitted and start putting together the report. They will submit it to the President by the 9th of March 2019.” Lawyers of suspended senior NPA advocate Nomgcobo Jiba have objected Freedom Under Law’s presentation before the Enquiry, saying it was biased and incited the anticipated recommendations of the enquiry. Freedom Under Law’s Max du Plessis told the Enquiry that former President Jacob Zuma ignored several court decisions citing the unfitness of Jiba and suspended senior NPA advocate Lawrence Mrwebi to hold office. Du Plessis has further accused former NDPP head Shaun Abrahams of unlawfully withdrawing fraud and perjury charges against Jiba. Jiba’s lawyer Norman Arendse says Du Plesis’ utterances are without basis. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
