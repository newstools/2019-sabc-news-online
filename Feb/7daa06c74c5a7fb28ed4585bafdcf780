Rescue operations will continue on Monday at the Gloria Coal Mine in Middleburg, Mpumalanga in an attempt to reach at least 20 illegal miners who are still trapped. Efforts to reach them were suspended last night because of the methane gas underground. The death toll after the explosion at the mine earlier this month currently stands at 13. “Round about 11 pm last night we encountered a high levels of methane gas and we pulled back. We have been installing ventilation to clear the area of methane. We have welded this bigger fan into place”, says Gloria Coal Mine business rescue practitioner Mike Elliot.
