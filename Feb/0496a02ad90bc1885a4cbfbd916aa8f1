The National Assembly’s Programme Committee wants the filling of eight vacancies in the SABC Board to be expedited. DA member of the committee John Steenhuisen says it will be a problematic state of affairs if the country goes to election while the SABC does not have a board. The current board lacks a quorum as there are only four non executive board members left. Over 223 candidates have been nominated and the shortlist process starts next Tuesday. Steenhuisen says it is critical to expedite the SABC Board selection process. He says: “What we don’t want to do is to go into an election period without a board at the SABC. I think it is going to be a very problematic state of affairs if that occurs and the board itself cannot meet because there is no quorum.” “I really think we need to push that into overdrive and I am reminded of the process we went through when the Public Protector was selected. It might not have had the desired outcome but certainly the process, people were sitting in Parliament all day into the night to finalise that. I think we need the same level of focus on filling these vacancies on the SABC Board.” Related video below
