The University of Kwa-Zulu Natal (UKZN) Student Representative Council (SRC) has extended its condolences to the friends and family of the Durban University of Technology (DUT) student killed amid protests on Tuesday. The student was shot dead during the student mass meeting at DUT demanding free registration and free education ultimately. Meanwhile, the UKZN SRC President Sanele Hlongwa, says the major issue is for the clearance of students who have outstanding debt in order for them to register. “The majority of our students can’t afford to pay the university fees in order to be cleared for registration, that’s part of the issues we are protesting for. The university needs to consider that there are people who can’t afford the fees that we are being subjected to,” says Hlongwa. Hlongwa says the university residences are not conducive and have a negative affect on students’ academic performance.
