Suspended National Prosecuting Authority senior advocate, Lawrence Mrwebi, has accused the police for having frustrated probes on the Richard Mdluli matter as they failed to declassify evidence documents in the docket. The Crime Intelligence Head was in 2012 accused of fraudulently purchasing luxury cars using the police secret fund. Mrwebi has been accused by previous witnesses of unlawfully withdrawing charges against Mdluli. Mrwebi is being cross examined by the Mokgoro Enquiry in Pretoria which seeks to determine his and colleague Nomgcobo Jibaâ€™s fitness to hold office. He blames the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. Meanwhile, evidence leader Nazreen Bawa has reminded Mrwebi that the enquiry has no subpoena powers to compel potential witnesses to appear before it.
