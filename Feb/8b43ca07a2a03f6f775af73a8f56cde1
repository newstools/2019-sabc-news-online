Four bodies have been retrieved from the bottom of a cliff at an airstrip in Port St Johns in the Eastern Cape after a car plunged off the cliff on Sunday. It’s apparently the third time a vehicle has been found at the bottom of the cliff. Police Spokesperson, Nozuko Handile, says defence force helicopters were used to assist in retrieving the bodies and the remains have been identified. “SANDF chopper was summoned, although it was dangerous to go there, but they didn’t take out the bodies. They went there again with another rescuer, which is (when) they got four bodies of the people who were there. Three were males, one was female. The families were already there and they identified the bodies,” says Handile.
