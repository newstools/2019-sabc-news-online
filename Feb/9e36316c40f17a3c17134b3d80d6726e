The disciplinary hearing over allegations of sexual abuse will continue on Wednesday against a 33-year-old Bryanston High School employee. This after a 17-year-old pupil at the school and her mother opened a sexual offence case.  The employee has since appeared in the Alexandra Regional Court. It’s understood that at least three female pupils have come forward with allegations against the man. The alleged incidents of sexual assault took place between 2017 and 2018, during netball matches and on school outings. The man is also facing an additional charge of financial mismanagement. It’s alleged he was receiving money from pupils and their parents but was not depositing the funds into the school account as required.
