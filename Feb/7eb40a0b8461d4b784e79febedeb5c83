The Democratic Alliance has written to the South African Human Rights Commission over Black First Land First spokesperson, Lindsay Maasdorp’s comments that celebrate the deaths of white learners at Hoërskool Driehoek. A fourth learner died on Saturday. Marnus Nagel was one of the 23 learners hospitalised after a walkway at the school collapsed on Friday. Maasdorp came out in support of a comment by a Facebook user who said he did not feel anything for the learners who lost their lives. The DA also launched a petition to prevent BLF leader Andile Mngxitama from contesting the 2019 General Elections. DA Youth Leader, Luyolo Mpithi says,  “We’ve also asked that the investigation is expedited to ensure that we can write to the IEC so they can bar the BLF from contesting the 2019 elections. We find it completely unacceptable that a group of people celebrate the death of young kids, regardless of their colour. We find it very disgusting. That is not a South Africa we want to be a part of or belong to.” Watch related video:
