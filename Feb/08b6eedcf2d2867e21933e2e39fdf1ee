The National Assembly has unanimously passed a motion that would dissolve the Assembly before the expiry of its term of office. More than 200 Members of Parliament voted in favour of the motion. The motion brought by African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu follows the recent announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that the election will be held on the 8 May. National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete read the results of the vote. “Honourable members whereas the House according to the Constitution needs at least 201 votes, we did achieve 249 votes in favour of the motion. And therefore the members have voted in support of the motion as required by Section 51 of the Constitution. The motion is accordingly agreed to and I thank you very much.” National Assembly to Dissolve https://t.co/FE7vTH5tdA #5thParliament pic.twitter.com/KHNbnkxw0l — Parliament of RSA (@ParliamentofRSA) February 21, 2019
