Suspended Deputy National head of Public Prosecutions Advocate, Nomgcobo Jiba, says there were no ulterior motives when she authorised the prosecution of racketeering charges against former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head, General Johan Booysen. Jiba is now facing grilling questions at the Mokgoro Enquiry. Booysen and scores others, attached to the Cato Manor Violent and Serious Crimes Unit, were in 2012 arrested and charged following a series of murders of taxi violence suspects and possible witnesses. Most of the victims belonged to the Stanger and Kwa Maphumolo Taxi Associations respectively. Jiba has been accused by witnesses of fabricating the charges against Booysen. Jiba insisted she did not have any personal vendetta against Booysen as she doesn’t know him personally. Click on videos below:
