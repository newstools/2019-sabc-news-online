Catherine McCleod, a national treasury economist, is expected to give testimony when the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture resumes in Parktown, Johannesburg. On Monday, deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo ruled that the application for leave to cross-examine former director-general at National Treasury, Lungisa Fuzile, would only be granted once former Finance minister and African Natioinal Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Des van Rooyenâ€™s legal team submits a supplementary affidavit. Former President Jacob Zuma appointed little known van Rooyen as Finance minister after axing Nhlanhla Nene in 2015. Van Rooyen only lasted three days in the portfolio after which Pravin Gordhan replaced him. The move is estimated to have cost the South African economy over 500-billion-rand.
