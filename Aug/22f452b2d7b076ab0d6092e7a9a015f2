Agriculture Minister, Thoko Didiza, says she’ll institute an investigation into the Mathulini community feud at uMthwalume on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Earlier, Didiza met both groups in an attempt to defuse land tensions. It’s alleged that a group of community members damaged farm property and attacked farm manager Sthembele Ngcobo, and also threw him into a burning cane field. Ngcobo survived the attack with third degree burns. Didiza says both groups allege some officials from the Land Claim Commission played a role in the problems. “We are here today to actually listen to both groups and understand what are the issues and how best can we resolve them. So, we have concluded after meeting both groups that the best way would be to have an investigation because as part of the allegations that are being raised, interestingly, by both groups point fingers to how the Department, as well as the Land Claims Commissioner and the Land Claim Commission in the region, might have acted which in some way might have created problems amongst this community.”  Watch video below:
