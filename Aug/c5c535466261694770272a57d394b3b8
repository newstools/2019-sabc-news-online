The High Court in Port Elizabeth has postponed until October 7Â the case of Pastor Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused and for the defence counsel to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). Judge Irma Schoeman dismissed his application for leave to appeal her decision that the authorisation certificate was valid and that the charges remained centralised and should not be heard in this jurisdiction. Schoeman says there are no reasonable prospects that the SCA would come to a different decision. She reiterated that the accused previously did not object to the jurisdiction and that there was no need to provide a new authorisation certificate when the court case re-started.
