The SABC is this morning expected to release its much anticipated report on alleged editorial interference. Veteran journalist and the former chairperson of the Press Council Joe Thloloe was tasked to look into political and editorial interference at the public broadcaster. The commission of inquiry also investigated alleged personal favours in the workplace. Meanwhile, a non-profit advocacy group, the Right2Know Campaign says those found guilty of wrongdoing must be held accountable. Songezo Mazizi says:”As a Right2Know campaign we believe that accountability is important and also this report will be able to cleanse what is happening at the SABC, knowing very well there are perpetrators within the SABC who have harassed workers at the SABC those must be brought to book and be sent to law enforcement.” Click video below:
