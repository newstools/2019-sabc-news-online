Member of the newly formed Regional Task Team Thabani Nyawose says:”We support them for the disbandment of the PEC in eThekwini and the establishment of the RTT as well the recalling of ANC deployees in the Ethekwini municipality.” “Those comrades who are not happy with decisions of the ANC, they must stop insulting our leadership. They must stop singing songs that incite violence that intimidate other members.” “They must stop disrupting ANC meetings. We have observed an attack directed to Mdumiseni Ntuli who is our provincial secretary. This must stop.” Related video click below:
