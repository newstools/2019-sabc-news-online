A brother of the late Gavin Watson, Valence, has lashed out at some media houses saying they’re engaged in a nefarious and racist agenda aimed at tarnishing the Watson family name. The CEO of African Global Operations, formerly known as Bosasa, died in a vehicle crash near OR Tambo International Airport on Monday morning. Bosasa has been implicated at the State Capture Commission in bribes allegedly paid to senior ANC leaders in alleged attempts to secure tenders. Speaking to SABC NEWS after his brother’s memorial service at the Little Falls Christian Centre in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg on Friday, Valence Watson said: “I believe a lot of the mainline media have been not only off the mark, they have lied, painted a story that is completely foreign to us and to those who know us.” “The agenda is nefarious, vicious and callous but we are comforted that people start realising that there’s an agenda here. Gavin’s passing just confirms that we need to be strong, steadfast, resolute because this country will still be what it should be. A non-racial, non-sexist country where everybody has an equal chance.” Related video:
