South African Communist Party General Secretary Blade Nzimande says the party will continue the fight against state capture and will also ensure that it still battles to protect the rights of the down-trodden. Nzimande was speaking in Ermelo in Mpumalanga at celebrations to mark the 98th anniversary of the founding of the party in South Africa. Nzimande says South Africaâ€™s SOEs like Eskom are in crisis because of the greed. The communist leader says the current energy crisis in the country is directly linked to the ravages of state capture.
