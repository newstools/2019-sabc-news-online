The trial of pastor Timothy Omotoso will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday, following the dismissal of an application to compel the state to provide further particulars on the charge sheet. Presiding Judge, Irma Schoeman said she was dismissing the application on the basis that the charge sheet has sufficient information for the defence’s preparations. Omotoso and co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho face a total of 97 charges. Schoeman told the court that the details that are reflected on the charge sheet are reasonable and they are sufficient for the accused. She further stated that the previous case, presided by Judge Mandela Makaula, had proceeded with no indications of a further appeal by the defence. On Thursday, defence lawyer Peter Daubermann said he did not anticipate that his application would be dismissed and needed time to prepare. Judge Schoeman then postponed the case until Friday. Meanwhile,  an official from the Department of Home Affairs gave Omotoso a document to sign, which stated that he remains a prohibited citizen. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
