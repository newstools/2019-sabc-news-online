The Stellenbosch Municipality has launched its first-ever Housing App for smartphones. Municipal Communications Manager, Stuart Grobbelaar says this is part of a campaign to update and refine their new Housing Demand Database. He says the app will help them determine where future projects should focus, as well as the type of housing assistance that residents qualify for. “The app is one of the first municipal applications in the country that focuses exclusively on providing a digital platform on which our residents can submit a housing application. Mayor Gesie van Deventer said at the launch today that this new app will feed into our new and updated housing demand database, that will allow us to keep accurate records and plan according to the needs of our residents.”
