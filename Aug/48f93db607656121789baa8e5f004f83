South African Revenue Service Commissioner, Edward Kieswetter, says they are working closely with the National Prosecuting Authority and other law enforcement agencies to get those involved in State Capture and tax fraud arrested. He says they will sign an memorandum of understanding. The commissioner says they have close to two thousand tax related cases awaiting prosecution and the SARS Specialised Tax unit will be working around the clock with law enforcement agencies. Kieswetter says the wheels are turning slowly but gradually. Last week, they had a number of tax payers who admitted to being part of a VAT fraud syndicate and some of them were immediately arrested.
