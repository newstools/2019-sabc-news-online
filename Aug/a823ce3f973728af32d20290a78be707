Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha says the court battle over the Vha-Venda kingship is a set-back to government because resources have already been utilised in the operation of the royal office. Mathabatha was addressing traditional leaders during the sitting of the House of Traditional Leaders in Polokwane. The dispute over the Vha-Venda kingship between King Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana and Princess Masindi Mphephu-Ramabulana has been heard in various courts, including the Constitutional Court as well as the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Mathabatha says government has already built infrastructure for the kingship. “The Vha-Venda kingship was recognised by the President. Government has already recognised that kingship and government has already build infrastructure for that kingship. But now if we have to reverse everything after this court ruling, for us its actually a very serious setback. Because you have to start things that you have already done, you will start them once again.”
