DNA experts have linked blood from one of the Phoenix triple murder victims to a pair of pants belonging to accused Colin Pillay 47, who pled not guilty to the murders. Pillay is accused of killing Jane Govindasamy and her daughters in their flat, and he has been charged with the theft of a cellphone and money. Senior forensic analyst Captain Regina Janse Van Rensburg told the court that DNA from samples taken from the pair of jeans tested positive for both Pillay and blood belonging to the youngest victim, 16-year-old Rackelle, who is believed was strangled to death. State prosecutor advocate Cheryl Naidu is expected to lead evidence from cell phone experts about messages sent between Pillay and the deceased.
