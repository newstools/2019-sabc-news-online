The City of Cape Town‘s traffic officials have arrested 300 taxi drivers in a week-long operation. The errant drivers were arrested for a host of offences, including drunk driving, reckless and negligent driving and outstanding warrants. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says the taxi drivers had close to 1 600 outstanding warrants totalling nearly R 3 million. “The enormity of the operation cannot be underestimated, but it needs to be done. Our traffic department continues to be overrun by complaints about the behaviour of taxi drivers, and the high number of warrants executed just in the last few days bears testament to the problem. The taxi industry needs to take responsibility for its actions. I urge errant drivers to pay their outstanding fines and to start showing greater regard for the rules of the road.”
