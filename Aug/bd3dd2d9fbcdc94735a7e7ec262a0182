The Board of Healthcare Funders of Southern Africa (BHF) has welcomed the release of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill . The long-awaited NHI Bill was introduced in Parliament on Thursday and is to be fully implemented by the year 2026. NHI is a health financing model which aims to provide quality health care to all South Africans, regardless of their financial status. The BHF says it will participate fully in the NHI and submit to the processes of the contemplated Bill. The BHF has always supported the NHI Bill with a sense that it advocates the provision of quality healthcare which is affordable, something that is currently lacking.    Watch video below:
