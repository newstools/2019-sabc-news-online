Free State Judge President Cagney Musi has refuted claims of corruption levelled against his division by former Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana. Giving evidence at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Dukwana said former Premier Ace Magashule had created a system of patronage and that structures such as the judiciary were compromised. Dukwana also referred to a defamation case that Magashule had filed in Bloemfontein, after claiming that he would never lose a case there. In a statement, Musi rejected Dukwana’s claims that Magashule had close relations with the province’s Judiciary. The Judge President has reaffirmed the commitment of all Judges and staff at the Division to the principles of independence, impartiality, accessibility, and effectiveness of the courts. He further encouraged members of the public or entities that have evidence of wrongdoing by a Judge to lodge a complaint with the Judicial Service Commission or any law enforcement agency so that the complaint can be dealt with as prescribed by the law.
