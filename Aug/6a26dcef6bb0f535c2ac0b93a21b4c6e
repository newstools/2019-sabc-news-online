Accident reconstruction expert, Konrad Lotter says the investigation into the death of Gavin Watson ranges from an accident to the possibility of a murder scene. The Bosasa CEO – now known as African Global Operations – died near the OR Tambo International Airport, east of Johannesburg, Monday morning. Police have opened a culpable homicide case after the 71-year-old crashed into a concrete pillar on the R21 highway. Lotter, who has been appointed to investigate the crash, says his team is looking into all possibilities which led to the incident. “At this stage, we will be analysing any possible explanation of the incident. In my investigation so far, based on things like the layout of the roads, I have probably identified three additional things that we need to look at which means we have to investigate a lot of details. One extreme could have been an easy explanation – a medical condition of the person in the vehicle. At the same time, you have to investigate it as if it were a murder scene – which means a lot of detail needs to go into the investigation.” Click video below for more:
