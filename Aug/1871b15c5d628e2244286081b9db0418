Chairperson of the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Federal Legal Commission, Glynnis Breytenbach says no decision has been made about action being taken against one of its MPs, Phumzile van Damme. According to weekend newspapers, the party is considering taking disciplinary action against Van Damme for punching a man at the V and A Waterfront during an alleged racist exchange in June. On social media, Van Damme had said the party has not informed her of any impending steps against her.    Breytenbach says the matter is still being investigated. “The Federal Legal Commission writes a report, sends it to FedEx with a recommendation and they will instruct us what to do. So whether Ms Van Damme will be charged or not, I have no idea and it is way premature to be talking about charges; we are talking about an investigation.”
