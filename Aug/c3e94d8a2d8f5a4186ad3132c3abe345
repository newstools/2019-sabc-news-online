The South African Optometrists Association (SAOA) have noted that they are being unfairly treated and their claims are being withheld by medical aid schemes based on their race and ethnicity. SAOA says unreasonable practices, lack of cooperation and intimidation by medical aid schemes, have prompted them to make submissions at the Investigations Inquiry. The Inquiry chaired by advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi is investigating the National Health Care Professionals Association. SAOA President Dolah Seboloka says there are many issues that need to be brought up for resolution. “Intimidation of members by schemes, the guilty until you prove yourself innocent approach as part of under section 59. That’s what the schemes do to our members. The non-accreditation of these networks, that means they are police, they are judges, they are prosecutors. They do everything. You are always at their mercy.”
