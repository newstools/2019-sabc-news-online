Teachers’ Union, Sadtu has accused the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department of being too scared to deal with former white schools that appear to be condoning racism. Sadtu Provincial Secretary, Nomarashiya Caluza says officials are to blame for the incidents of racism and abuse reported at the former Model C schools. In one incident, a teacher at the Westville Girls High School in Durban allegedly told learners that white people are genetically smarter than people of colour. Caluza says department officials are reluctant to investigate allegations of racism and misconduct and this makes the situation even worse. “I really don’t think there is anything wrong with the policies that the department has because the first one that is supposed to be guiding all of us is the constitution of the land, which is very clear. Then on top of that, there are educational policies. The only problem that we have are the officials of the Department of Education who are scared of going to some of these schools. There are schools here that are untouchable because the officials are afraid of going there and those schools continue to behave in a manner as if we are still in the apartheid,” says Caluza.
