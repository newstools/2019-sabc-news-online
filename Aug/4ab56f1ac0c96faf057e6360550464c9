A body has been found in a sugarcane filed in Camperdown in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. The body is believed to be that of a man who was kidnapped in July in Westcliff in Chatsworth south of Durban. Police managed to arrest three suspects. Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane says the kidnappers demanded a ransom from his family, who transferred a sum of money into a bank account but the victim was never released. He says they managed to arrest another two suspects who were linked to the kidnapping of this man in the Hammersdale area. Police have opened a case of murder and investigations continue.
