Public Service and Administration Minister, Senzo Mchunu, has allayed fears that public servants aged 55-years-old and above will be forced into retirement and that the civil service will be reduced by 10% to cut the wage bill. He was addressing hundreds of senior public servants at the launch of the annual Integrated Public Service Month in Polokwane. Mchunu says they are still in discussion with labour and an announcement will be made once an agreement has been reached. “What we are prioritising is stabilising public service in the Republic and there are many aspects on this one. We are dealing with that matter with the leadership of labour and very soon when we meet and deliberate, we will make an announcement of the outcome of our deliberations.” Mchunu also urged public servants to be professional when assisting the public. “Each and every accounting officer here, each and every senior officer here, check the people that work under you, how professional and how unprofessional they are, from what they say, from what they do in particular, help them to be professional.”
