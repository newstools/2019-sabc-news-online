President Cyril Ramaphosa will be meeting with the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on a monthly basis along with various departments to oversee the implementation of the agenda set out in the Nedlac report on the Framework Agreement adopted at last year’s Presidential Job Summit. This was announced by Employment and Labour Minister, Thulas Nxesi after the President received the Nedlac report on Thursday. Nxesi says amongst the key issues discussed at the gathering was the issue of electricity prices and water licensing. “Two big issues which have emerged is the issue of electricity and the pricing of electricity. What is going on in terms of dealing with Eskom turning it around became a big issue and the other issue was the issue of the water licensing. As a result of that, the President has taken extraordinary measures to say instead of meeting as Nedlac dealing with these issues on a quarterly basis, now he has instructed that he is going to need to meet on monthly basis – every first week of the month – and then we are going to be drawing a plan talking about timelines and talking about the milestones.”  On Thursday, Ramaphosa received Nedlac’s report on the progress regarding the Framework Agreement adopted at the job summit. Nxesi says in light of the latest unemployment statistics, it’s time for a plan of action in tackling the jobs crisis. “All the departments now who are responsible are going to be made to account on everything. There will be no excuses; this is crunch time. We are in a deep crisis we can no longer just talk in the boardrooms. We need concrete plans and that’s what is going to start happening from September. Concrete actions have to be implemented.” Watch a related video below:
