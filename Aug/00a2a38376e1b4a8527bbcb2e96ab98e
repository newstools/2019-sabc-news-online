The South African Communist Party (SACP) in Limpopo has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to establish a ministerial task team to investigate all political killings in Limpopo. This after six African National Congress (ANC) members who were vocal on allegations of corruption in municipalities were shot and killed in areas such as Thohoyandou, Mogakalwena and in Tubatse in the past three years. Addressing members during a march to the Thohoyandou police station, SACP provincial spokesperson Matshike Thobejane says, “The SACP gathered here together with the alliance and MDM structure supported by business in making a pertinent call to the President of the Republic of South Africa Comrade Cyril, to put an inter-ministerial task team which must investigate and report back to him immediately on progress with regard to underlining of political killings in Limpopo. Because we cannot take it anymore. “This task team must work with speed report back to him, and there should be action based on their recommendation which must consider with normal law processes which must put to book the killers and their financiers,” Thobejane explains.
