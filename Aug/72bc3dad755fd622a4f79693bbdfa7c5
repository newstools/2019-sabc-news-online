South Africa and Tanzania have pledged to boost trade-investment during a state visit to Dar Es Salaam by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Tanzania is also looking to learn from the South African economy while calling for more investment. Ramaphosa’s reception in Tanzania marks decades-long cooperation between the two nations. Tanzania President John Magufuli says his visit to “our country is another opportunity to grow and strengthen the cooperation that we have.” South Africa is Tanzania’s biggest purchaser of exports, importing $743 million worth of products from Tanzania in 2017. The relationship goes both ways with Tanzania importing South African goods worth $437.7 million in 2018.   -Reporting by Daniel Kijo.
