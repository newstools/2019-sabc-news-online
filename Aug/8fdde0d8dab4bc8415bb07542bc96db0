The Presidency has called on the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to act in line with rules that demand that any information that she has in her possession be kept confidential. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s lawyers have asked the High Court in Pretoria to ensure that the bank statements that Mkhwebane used in her Bosasa report are not made public. There are reports that the statements will be in the public domain on Sunday. In a letter addressed to the Deputy Judge President, Aubrey Ledwaba, Ramaphosa argues that he, as well as those who donated money to his CR17 campaign for ANC presidency, are entitled to privacy. Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko says they have received information about the leaking of the statements to the media. She says the Public Protector must take reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of the bank statements. Click video below:  Mkhwebane’s investigation has found that Ramaphosa spent hundreds of millions of rand on his campaign for the ANC presidency. Ramaphosa is contesting the entire investigation and has maintained that he did nothing wrong or illegal. Diko is adamant that the President has nothing to hide. “There is no regulation that demands that any party require politicians to disclose their personal funding. The President has said on record that if such a policy existed he would comply with it. The CR17 was undertaken in a manner that is within the legal system, there is no crime, no public funds but rather you have 100 private individuals who came together and donated to this campaign.”
