The former Rural Development and Land Reform Minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, says she will study Friday’s court ruling against her in relation to a redevelopment plan for District Six in Cape Town. The Land Claims court found that she failed to comply with a court order from the High Court in Cape Town in November last year to have a plan ready by February this year. Nkoana-Mashabane is currently the minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth, and Persons with Disabilities. Her spokesperson, Shalen Gajadhar, says the minister will also seek legal advice on the cost order issued against her. “Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth, and Persons with Disabilities Ms. Maite Nkoana-Mashabane notes and respects the court order issued by the Land Claims Court, relating to her while she was Minister of the then Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. Minister Nkoana-Mashabane will study the court judgement, and take legal advice on what further actions to take, especially in relation to the cost order issued against her in her personal capacity.”  Click on the video below:
