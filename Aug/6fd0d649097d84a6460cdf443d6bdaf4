The community of Ciko, near Willowvale in the Eastern Cape, are still struggling to comprehend the death of seven family members two weeks ago in a house fire. The members of the Xhalisile family perished when the house they were sleeping in caught fire in the early hours of the morning. The deceased were buried in the village on Saturday. The 56-year-old Nowandisile Xhalisile, her daughter, and five grandchildren as young as three years old died in the inferno. The family is still utterly devastated. The cause of the fire remains unknown as the police investigation is ongoing, but there is a strong suspicion among the community that this was no accident. Police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha says, “We are busy with extensive investigation and within three weeks we will come up with the report.” In recent weeks, house fires have killed 12 people in Mthatha, Mbizana, and Willowvale. A point of concern for the provincial government. Social development MEC Siphokazi Mani-Lusithi says, “We are concerned about these killings in the province… We are calling on people to unite and fight it.” The department of social development will also be rolling out an awareness campaign about gender-based violence, with a focus on rural areas.
