SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter has warned people to continue paying their taxes even though there has been lack of trust in the institution. Kieswetter says taxpayers are feeling justified in withholding their taxes because of the widespread corruption in the country. He says SARS has lost billions of rands because of the non-payment of tax. He was speaking at the Tax Conference in northern Joburg on Tuesday. “I caution against anyone who is promoting a tax revolt. As far as we are concerned, if you do not pay your taxes you are breaking the law but international theory that informs revenue authority suggests that when the public loses confidence and trust in the revenue authority and there are a number of reasons that we can explore, that brings about that lack of trust but currently where we are there is a low level of trust. We see a decline in tax morality people feel morally justified to withhold their taxes.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/737713">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on the related video below:
