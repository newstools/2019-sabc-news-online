Struggle stalwart, Sophie de Bruyn, says the generation of the 1956 struggle would be shocked at the current state of the country. Ahead of Women’s Day, De Bruyn was paying tribute to fallen comrades Mary Moodley and Ma Albertina Sisulu at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg. “I often wonder how Aunty Mary and our other leaders and icons feel about our country. The country they worked for so hard to make a difference in the lives of our people and generation what it has come to. She must feel it has come to naught,” says De Bruyn. More concerning for the struggle icon is the apparent marginalisation of minority races, an issue she took up with the former African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general, Gwede Mantashe. “I never thought the day would come where I will be known as a minority. He said to me no, he jumped up quickly he said no, you are not a minority…don’t worry about that. I said that is what you say, but what are you as a leader doing to the rank and file as you sit in your office you say I’m not a minority but on the outside the ANC and its people say the opposite, so we left it there, things have gone worse.” Fast forward to 2019, the struggle for women still endures.
