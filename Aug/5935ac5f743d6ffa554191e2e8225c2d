Speakers have paid tribute to business tycoon Thandi Ndlovu at a memorial service held in Kempton Park in Johannesburg. A medical doctor by profession, Ndlovu died in a car crash in Rustenburg in North West on Saturday. The business tycoon has been hailed for venturing into the male-dominated construction industry when she founded Motheo Construction. Labour minister Thulas Nxesi was among those who attended the service for Doctor-T as Ndlovu was affectionately known. Nxesi hailed Ndlovu for being exemplary. “The details of Dr Ndlovu’s life were exemplary, a soldier in the service of the liberation struggle, an academic and intellectual, a businesswoman of note. We can honour the memory of Dr Ndlovu by continuing her work, by supporting the role of women in construction, may her soul rest in peace.” Her funeral service will be held at House of Treasure Ministries in Johannesburg this Friday.
