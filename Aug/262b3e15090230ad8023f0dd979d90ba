Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba says police should effect swift arrests following Thursday’s violent scenes in the Johannesburg CBD where illegal vendors hurled stones at police vehicles. The South African Police Services requested backup from the Metro police after their nyala was pelted with rocks. In a video the nyala can be seen reversing before driving away from the advancing crowd. Four police vehicles were damaged. Police were trying to evict illegal vendors in a highly congested area.  Mashaba says it is unacceptable to have a society that treats law enforcement agencies with such violence. “South Africa is having serious, serious problems with counterfeit goods being brought into our country which are destroying jobs, they’re destroying our economy and the police were dealing with this illegal activity and on the basis of that these traders unfortunately decided to attack our police. It is totally unacceptable that we can have people attacking our law enforcement agencies in that manner,” says Mashaba.
