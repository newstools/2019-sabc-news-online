The recalled African National Congress (ANC) political office bearers in the eThekwini Metro and uMsunduzi municipality have until Monday to tender their resignation letters with their respective municipal managers. Among them is eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede and uMsunduzi mayor, Themba Njilo. ANC members of the two municipalities’ executive committees were recalled by the party for the alleged collapse of governance in the two municipalities. Gumede, who is facing fraud and corruption charges, has been on leave since June on the ANC’s instruction. ANC provincial secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli, is said to have written them a text message, reminding them to tender their resignation. Meanwhile, the ANC wants KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Mxolisi Kaunda, to replace Gumede as eThekwini mayor. A full eThekwini council meeting is scheduled for Thursday. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
