Gauteng police say at least 11 people have been arrested after foreign-owned businesses were looted and foreign nationals were attacked on Wednesday night in parts of Soweto. Several shops in Dobsonville, Rockville, Zola, Meadowlands, Ennerdale and Protea Glen were looted and shop owners forced to flee. Community members claim the looting was in reaction to counterfeit goods raids on shops by police in the Johannesburg CBD three weeks ago. Gauteng Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says: “Police are still monitoring the area and we are continuing to make sure that those who still want to leave the area are escorted out of the area. We are continuing to identify those who were involved [in the attacks] and we are going to trace and arrest them.” WATCH BELOW:
