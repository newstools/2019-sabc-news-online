A group of protesters have invaded a Metrorail train station on the Germiston Knights railway line on Gauteng’s East Rand, causing extensive damage to property on Wednesday. It’s believed the group was protesting over service delivery related issues.  There are reports of tyres being burned on the railway tracks. Metrorail security guards have so far arrested three people.  The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) says trains operating along this line have been affected. “It absolutely has because in the past where we had similar situations with protesters coming to our stations, they have stoned the trains, putting the lives of our customers in a negative position. We’ve had to close that line because in most cases there are objects put on the rail track. We can’t guarantee the safety of train movement,” says Nana Zenani  Prasa Spokesperson.
