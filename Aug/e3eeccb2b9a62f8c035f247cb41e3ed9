Botswana’s 2019 polls may be the toughest and most competitive elections the landlocked nation has seen yet. This as the governing Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has experienced a significant decline in popular votes over the years, falling from 80% in 1965 to 47% in 2014. The BDP faces a tough battle to retain power in the face of fierce competition from a coalition of three parties under the Umbrella for Democratic Change, as well as new parties including the Botswana Patriotic Front. The elections are due to be held in October. Wynter Mmolotsi, the President of the Alliance for Progressives, which will be contesting elections for the first time says, “We are hoping for a win. We are in this game to win because we are doing everything in our interest and in our power to ensure that we cover all corners of this country.” He adds: “We have produced one of the best manifestos that we are trying to sell to the nation and we are very convinced that Batswana are listening to us.” Watch related video below:
