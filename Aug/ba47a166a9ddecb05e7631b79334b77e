Serious economic crime expert Mike Bolhuis says foul play shouldn’t be ruled-out in the death of African Global Operations (AGO) CEO Gavin Watson. This comes amid reports that the Hawks are to meet investigators looking into the death of Watson.  AGO, formerly known as Bosasa, had been linked to numerous donations to politically connected people and alleged tender rigging. Watson died when his car crashed near OR Tambo International Airport, east of Johannesburg. His car hit a concrete pillar at a bridge close to the entrance to the airport on the R21. Bolhuis says there are many possibilities. “In the last couple of months we have seen an increase in hits and very professional. In other words those who commit these hits are getting away with it and it has to do with people with extremely important information.” Watch video below for more on the story:
