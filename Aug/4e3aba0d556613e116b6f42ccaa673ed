The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to reconsider appointing a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the 2017 stampede at the FNB Stadium in Soweto which claimed the lives of two people. The party is not happy with Sport, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa’s written reply to a Parliamentary question on the matter. In his reply to DA MP Tsepo Mhlongo, Mthethwa says Ramaphosa is of the view that there is an unprecedented proliferation which has resulted in too many Commissions of Inquiry being established. Mthethwa told Mhlongo that all remedies and actions emanating from the finding and recommendation of the Ngoepe Commission of Inquiry which investigated the 2001 Ellis Park tragic stampede have not yet been exhausted. Mhlongo says an inquiry into the FNB incident is crucial. “Families cannot find closure after two years of this tragedy. The stampede will happen again in different stadiums because there is no plan and we did not even investigate.” “As the Sports Committee I am calling on the ANC-led government to relook this matter.” Related video click below:
