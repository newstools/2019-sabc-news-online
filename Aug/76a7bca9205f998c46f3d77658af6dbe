It has emerged that the embattled mayors of the eThekwini and uMsunduzi municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal have not yet officially resigned. Zandile Gumede and Themba Njilo were removed from their positions earlier in August in a move that the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) described as  deployment. Gumede was removed following her arrest for fraud and corruption in connection with a tender. The party placed her on a two-month leave of absence. Some reports say Gumede and Njilo were removed due to poor performance in the delivery of basic services. The African National Congress (ANC) provincial secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli, says the two officials are now expected to officially resign: “There’s an expectation that now that we’ve finalised the deployment, all of them are going to be resigning during the course of this period leading to the next sitting council meetings. In eThekwini for instance, the council meeting is going to be taking place next week Thursday and we’d expect that council meeting to elect the new leadership which effectively means that the comrades are required to tender their resignations to the councils and the ANC in terms of the current positions which they occupy.” Watch a related video below:
