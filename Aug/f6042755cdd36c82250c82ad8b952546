Suspended KwaZulu-Natal Correctional Services Commissioner, Mnikelwa Nxele, has been dismissed. He was implicated in the State Capture Commission in Parktown Johannesburg for allegedly receiving monthly bribes of about R57 000. Announcing Nxele’s dismissal, Acting Provincial Commissioner, James Smalberger, says the department would continue to operate as normal. “The decision was as a result of an internal disciplinary process and Mr Nxele has been duly informed. The key thing at this stage is to ensure that the department continues to execute its function unhindered. I will continue to act as the regional commissioner. It’s safe to say I am the Chief Deputy Commissioner at our National head office, but since deployment I’m here on a fulltime basis.” Watch related video below:
