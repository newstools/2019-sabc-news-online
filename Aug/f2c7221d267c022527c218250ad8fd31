Members of the environmental NGO, Greenpeace Africa have blocked the entrance to Eskom’s headquarters at Megawatt Park in Johannesburg. The protest is aimed at highlighting what they say is the premature deaths and diseases allegedly caused by Eskom’s coal-fired power stations. According to a Greenpeace study, Mpumalanga is the second worst pollution hotspot in the world. Greenpeace Africa’s Kristen Steel says, ”We are here today because this is an air pollution crisis and people are paying the price for Eskom’s pollution with their health in some places with their lives. What we are asking is that Eskom agrees to comply with the minimum emission standards which are set in place to limit the pollution.”
