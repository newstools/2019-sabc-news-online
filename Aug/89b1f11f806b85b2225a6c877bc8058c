Political analyst, Ralph Mathekga, says President Cyril Ramaphosa should not be selective about what information should be available to the public. Ramaphosa has approached the Deputy President of the High Court in Pretoria to request that certain information contained in the records of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane be sealed and not disclosed to the public. Earlier emails suggesting that President Ramaphosa had knowledge of the CR17 funding raising campaign for African National Congress (ANC) Presidency were leaked to the media. This is contrary to earlier assertions that he was not involved. The President’s lawyers have accused Mkhwebane of unlawfully obtaining financial information from bank accounts linked to a company which she used in a report implicating Ramaphosa in money laundering. Last month, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa violated the Executive Ethics Code by misleading Parliament on the R500 000 Bosasa donation. Mathekga says President Ramaphosa’s decision raises more questions than answers. “You cannot seal that information. If people realise that you are making an effort to hold things confidentially in this regard, it does raise questions such as why is it that you are so committed to keeping this information from the public eye. It just doesn’t seat well with someone who actually said that they are going to behave differently with regard to transparency. It makes this thing bigger than it was initially was.” Watch video below:
