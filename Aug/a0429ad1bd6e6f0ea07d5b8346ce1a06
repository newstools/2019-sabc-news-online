The Bakoena ba Mopeli chiefdom in QwaQwa, Free State, says the passing of the princess is a great loss not only to the family but to the entire community. Princess Manapo Mopeli died on Saturday evening following a short illness. She will be laid to rest on Friday at Thaba Bosiu cemetery in QwaQwa. Royal family spokesperson, Tsholo Mopeli says the princess will be remembered for her efforts to see the Basotho nation developing like other nations. “We know about her efforts and endeavours she made to try and elevate our culture as Basotho by taking the customary Basotho blankets and modernising it to be more appealing to the modern generation. The passing has really hurt us as the family. She will be remembered as a very fun, loving, jolly and forgiving princess. We are also very grateful to the entire public who decided to support and cry along with the family,” says Mopeli.
