The  African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) is calling on the Department of Basic Education to do away with Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) at schools. The opposition party marched to the department’s head office in Pretoria on Saturday to demand that CSE be removed from the school curriculum. ACPD President Kenneth Moshoe addressed party supporters outside the headquarters of the Basic Education Department in Pretoria. “CSE promotes condoms to children without informing them of their failure rate. When you read CSE, when they teach about giving children condoms, it not just handing them over; they say they must know how to put them on. It even says boys should know how to wear male condoms and they should also know how to put in female condoms. How are boys going to put in female condoms on the girls?…” The ACDP has given the department until August 30 to respond to its memorandum. Failure to that, the party will partake in more protest marches to all department offices in the nine provinces.
