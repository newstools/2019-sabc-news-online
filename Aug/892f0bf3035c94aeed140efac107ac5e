Thirty-five-year old Tshegofatso Selahle, who died while being arrested by metro police in Johannesburg, will be laid to rest in Polokwane on Saturday. The JMPD alleges that Selahle was resisting arrest because he was drunk. The funeral service will start at the Selahle home in Mankweng. Mourners will then proceed to the Westerburg community hall. Selahle died on Sunday after being pursued by Johannesburg Metro Police officers, who said he had skipped a red traffic light and resisted arrest. It is alleged Selahle informed officers that he was struggling to breathe after being put inside a JMPD van. An ambulance was called, but he died before its arrival.
