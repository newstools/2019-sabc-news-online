The attempted murder trial of ex-convict Mark Scott-Crossley will resume in the Lenyenye Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Scott-Crossley is on trial for allegedly running over Silence Mabundza with a vehicle twice in December 2016. During his last appearance, the Lenyenye Magistrate set aside Scott-Crossley’s application to have all charges against him dismissed. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence that the accused had to answer. Scott-Crossley was arrested a month after the alleged incident after being on the run. He is currently out on bail. The defence has indicated that they will be submitting documents to appeal the judge’s decision not to dismiss the case. Watch related video:
