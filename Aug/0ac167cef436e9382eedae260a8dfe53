US President, Donald Trump, on Monday said China’s call for “calm” trade negotiations sent a positive message and should also be applied to the situation in Hong Kong. Concerns for the global economy have increased as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington mounted in recent days. Trump said the United States hadn’t been happy with the World Trade Organization‘s (WTO) handling of trade disputes but that his country was now getting treated better. China’s Commerce Ministry said last week it would impose additional tariffs of 5 or 10 percent on a total of 5078 products originating from the United States, including crude oil, agricultural products and small aircraft. In retaliation, Trump said he was ordering US companies to look at ways to close operations in China and make products in the United States
