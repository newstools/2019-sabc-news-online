Henri van Breda has been dealt a blow after the Constitutional Court dismissed his application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. The High Court in the Western Cape found Van Breda guilty of murdering both his parents and his elder brother with an axe in their Stellenbosch home in 2015. His younger sister was severely wounded. Van Breda is serving three life sentences for the murders and a further 15 years for the attempted murder of his sister. In a statement dated July 29, the Apex Court found that the application for leave to appeal bore no reasonable prospect of success. The application for condonation has been granted.
