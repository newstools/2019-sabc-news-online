AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini has warned people to be careful of those who he claims want to control their land. This follows proposals by the presidential advisory panel on Land Reform and Agriculture to scrap the Ingonyama Trust Board.

He says people should not trust leaders to decide on their land, who he claims have been found guilty of corruption by courts and commissions. Click video below:
