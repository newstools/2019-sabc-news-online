Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State says Metsimaholo Municipality officials who failed to ensure that residents of Themba Kubheka section in Deneysville get electricity must be held accountable. The party says the municipality failed to appoint a contractor despite receiving a large amount of money from the national government to install electricity in the area. Residents protested on Thursday by burning tyres and barricading roads; complaining about a lack of electricity, water and housing. EFF Free State Secretary, Busanku Msimanga says problems in Deneysville show a failing African National Congress (ANC) government. “We have people who want to enrich themselves at all costs, who are worried who get a tender. Is it the person who is close to me? It’s not about taking services to our people. I am saying it’s community who suffer. They have less interest who gets a tender,” says Msimanga.
