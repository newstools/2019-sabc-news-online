Sars Commissioner Edward Kieswetter says the reconstruction of the revenue service continues. Speaking at the Tax Indaba 2019 in Sandton, he admitted the tax collector is still in the aftermath of the State Capture project, which almost destroyed years of good work. There is no date set on when Sars will go back to its former glory after the State Capture setback. But taxman Edward Kieswetter says the collection authority is definitely on a path to recovery. The Nugent Commission showed that governance was weakened at Sars which lead to a mass exodus of skills, which resulted in a decline in morale. Kieswetter is of the view that consulting firms, such as Mckinsey and Bain, were complicit in weakening this once-respected world-class institution. The loss of trust in the institution has planted a seed of tax revolt in the minds of some South Africans. But Kieswetter has cautioned against this, saying that will only prevent the government from creating a strong and capable state. Deputy Finance Minister Dr David Masondo said the budget deficit is expected to widen to 4.5%. This is on the back of rising government debt, servicing costs and a weak economy. Masondo said the country needed to ensure the fiscal policy was sustainable in order to rebuild the economy. The National Treasury has welcomed efforts to restore trust and rebuild the South African Revenue Service. For a related video click below:
