The Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape is to lay criminal charges for damage to its water infrastructure.  The Municipal Manager Thandekile Mnyimba says a petrol bomb was thrown at the Stutterheim treatment plant on Saturday night. The damage was minimal and the plant remains operational. A municipal workers’ strike is also affecting water supply to a number of towns that the municipality services. Dr Mnyimba says they want to get to the root of the problem. “One of our plants in Stutterheim was attacked, it was on fire but not that much damage occurred on site. So we have opted to secure our plants by ensuring that we have beefed up security on the site. Police are still investigating the matter.”
