Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says his party is ready to effect socio-economic changes in the troubled Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in the Free State. Maimane has been campaigning in QwaQwa ahead of Wednesday’s by-elections. The cash-strapped municipality has been placed under administration. Maimane says they have fielded the best candidates to contest 15 vacant wards in the municipality. “So let’s select the best people to run the municipality and secondly let’s make sure that every cent that is collected in this municipality is not used to profit politicians but used for the people. Thirdly let’s get the engineering capacity to make that water system work so that people can open taps and water comes on. “ Maimane adds that the money the municipality owes to Eskom has to be paid. “We’ve got to recoup some of the money, pay Eskom so that we can begin to deliver reliable electricity for the people here of Maluti-A-Phofung and therefore the DA is saying give us two years because the next elections after this Wednesday will be in 2021.”
