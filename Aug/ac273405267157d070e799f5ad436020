The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have rejected Minister Tito Mboweni’s document on economic development. Its leader Julius Malema further says they won’t tolerate the continuing attacks on Public Protector, for ruling against those who are favoured in the country. The EFF is holding its Central Command Team meeting in Johannesburg this weekend. Following the release of an Economic Growth Document by Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni earlier this week where he has invited South Africans to make inputs. The EFF has weighed in. It rejects the document saying it seeks to privatise SOEs. “We reject it out rightly because it seeks to privatize almost everything. The railways, Eskom and he thinks that through that he will grow the economy. But there is no emphasis on how that is going to create jobs because we know privatization goes hand in hand with retrenchments.” On the recent call by Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) that President Cyril Ramaphosa visit Marikana, Malema who was amongst the first people to arrive in Marikana after the massacre says it is up to the people of Marikana.
