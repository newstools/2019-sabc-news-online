Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has challenged Human Settlements and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Lebohang Maile to put the municipality under administration. In his maiden budget speech , Maile threatened to make an announcement on some poorly-run Gauteng municipalities, including the Democratic Alliance (DA) run cities of Tshwane and Johannesburg. However, Mashaba says the City’s finances have never been better. “Ask him to go ahead, tell him he is most welcome to even try. Putting a city under administration is not something you decide upon in a shebeen or shesanyama, you decide about this when you have facts, so his decisions I don’t think they were well-thought out. But he is most welcome to do whatever he believes.”
