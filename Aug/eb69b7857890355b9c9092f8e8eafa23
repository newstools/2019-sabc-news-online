The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to ensure that the issue of e-tolls is addressed before the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Amendment Act (AARTO) is implemented. The party says it is concerned that the Act is putting businesses at risk as truck drivers that work for small businesses could lose their jobs.  This is because their licences will be suspended for three years if they don’t pay the R500 fine. The Act indicates that operator class vehicles will be fined R500 for every gantry they pass without paying e-tolls. “The problem is that under AARTO you can get a fine for not paying your e-tolls; and the fine can lead to your licence being suspended. We therefore call on the President to make sure that the e-toll question is resolved before the AARTO comes into effect,” says Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Fred Nel.
