Former SABC interim board members Khanyisile Kweyama, Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, Mathatha Tsedu, Krish Naidoo and John Matisonn have again denied any wrongdoing in connection with the Special Investigating Unit’s (SIU) report which found evidence of irregularities in the awarding of a security contract. They have been briefing the media in Sandton, north of Johannesburg. The R185-million security tender was given to Mafoko Security Patrols in 2017 despite another company – Mjayeli reportedly scoring higher during the bidding process. The former Interim board says they are shocked by the findings contained in the SIU report. The board said they were the ones spending sleepless night and making sacrifices to save the SABC. They also pointed out that they saved the institution half a billion rand while they held the fort between April and September in 2017. The board says the SIU made so many mistakes on a host of issues including basic things such as who reported the matter. Watch media briefing below:
