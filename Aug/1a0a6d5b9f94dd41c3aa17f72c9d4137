An HIV/Aids activist is using her experience to establish rural support groups for HIV positive people including teenagers, born and living with the virus. The 45-year-old Mpho Lekgetho has been living with the virus for almost two-decades and is using her experience to help others. Her community outreach programs reach a few villages around the Kuruman area. Lekgetho who has also authored a book about her experiences, says stigma and lack of information remains a challenge for rural communities. “Issues of stigma and rejection are the challenges that we face. I am raising kids, they are also community members so they are also facing challenges of somehow having to explain themselves to the society about me or what is happening in my life.” “Sometimes they get questions like how do you tell us that you are HIV negative when we know your mom is positive?”
