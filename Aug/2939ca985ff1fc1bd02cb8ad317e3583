The teenagers, who were part of the Cape to Cairo challenge, are expected to arrive at Lanseria airport, north of Johannesburg on Sunday. The group of 20 teenagers built a four-seater Sling 4 plane which took off from Cape Town and made it all the way to Cairo in Egypt. Six young pilots were part of the journey which aimed to inspire youth across the world to chase their dreams and not to allow their past to limit them. However, two support pilots in a different plane died when their aircraft crashed in Tanzania earlier this month. Des Werner and Werner Froneman, the project directors, were in a support plane following the teenagers that went down in Tabora region in Tanzania. It was owned by U Dream Global, an organisation founded by 17-year-old Megan Werner, Des Wernerâ€™s daughter. Megan and the team are expected back in Lanseria on Sunday to talk about their journey.
