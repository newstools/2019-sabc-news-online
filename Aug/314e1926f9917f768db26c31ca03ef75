The current SABC Board says it will support the application by the Special Investigating Unit to have the contract between the public broadcaster and Mafoko Security Patrols reviewed and set aside. In a report released on Sunday morning, the SIU found serious irregularities in the procurement and awarding of the R185-million  tender by members of the SABC’s former Interim Board. SABC Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini says the broadcaster is preparing court papers and will not comment further on the SIU Report and related matters until the papers have been lodged in court.

Malatji says, “The report of the SIU clearly indicates there are no corrupt elements here at play. So how can that possibly constitute delinquency? Our clients must of necessity, because of the intentions of the SIU to declare them delinquent, intervene in the proceedings and apply for a review of setting aside of the SIU report. We believe it is factually incorrect and doesn’t have factual basis for the conclusions that it has reached. So that is the recourse we are looking at – intervene in the proceedings and seeking a review and setting aside of the report.” Click on the videos below:  Mafoko Security has distanced itself from any wrongdoing.
