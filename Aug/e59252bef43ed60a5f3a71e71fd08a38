The South African National Parks (SANParks) has opened the gates of 21 parks to visitors for free for eight days. This year’s 14th annual SA National Parks Week will run from Sunday 8th to 15th September. SANParks Spokesperson, Fayroush Ludick says since they started the programme in 2006, a total of 438 400 South Africans have been afforded the opportunity to enter the national parks. “South African National Parks week is an opportunity for South African citizens to visit parks with no cost to them for eight days this year. In the past, we have always done it over five days – Monday to Friday – but a continuous call for it to be extended to weekends to get more people into the parks that normally wouldn’t between Mondays and Fridays. So this year, we are definitely looking to up our numbers and invite more people into the park that previously wouldn’t have had the opportunity to do so.”
