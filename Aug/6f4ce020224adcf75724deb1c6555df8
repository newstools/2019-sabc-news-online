President Cyril Ramaphosa has asked the Gauteng High Court to have certain information in the Public Protector’s records “sealed and not be disclosed to the public”. This comes after reports about Ramaphosa’s alleged involvement in the CR17 fundraising campaign were leaked to the media. Ramaphosa’s lawyers have accused the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane of unlawfully obtaining financial information from bank accounts linked to the campaign, which she used in her report implicating him in money laundering. SABC News has verified the authenticity of the letter. Letter to the DJP regarding the public protector’s record  from SABC News   Disciplinary action against Gordhan President Ramaphosa won a court case against the Public Protector on Thursday after a judge found he had acted reasonably in not immediately disciplining Public Enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan over a decision regarding the retirement of a tax official. Ramaphosa secured an interdict from the court, meaning he does not have to implement disciplinary action against Gordhan while Gordhan appeals against a finding by Public Protector. Thursday’s ruling was the third high-profile court defeat for Mkhwebane in as many weeks.  -Additional reporting by Reuters.
