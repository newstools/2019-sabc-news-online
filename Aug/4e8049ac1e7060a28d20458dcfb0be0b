National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has agreed to schedule a debate on the country’s jobs crisis requested by Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane. Maimane says the DA will use the debate to table its “Economic Recovery Plan” which it says is a comprehensive package of reform interventions that are pro-growth, pro-investment, and pro-job creation. In a statement, Maimane says the debate will need to address unsustainable levels of government spending. This includes a plan to stop runaway bailouts to mismanaged State Owned Enterprises such as Eskom, the size and growth of the Public Sector Wage Bill and how to stimulate both local and foreign investment. The DA’s plan will include proposals to split Eskom into two separate entities and allow Independent Power Producers to come on board. It will also involve rejecting the National Health Insurance, immediately placing South African Airways under business rescue, cutting the Public Sector Wage Bill and freeing up micro enterprise and relaxing labour legislation.
