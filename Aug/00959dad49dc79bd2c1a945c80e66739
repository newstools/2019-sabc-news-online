Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has postponed his decision as to whether former Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba can cross-examine former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. Agrizzi in testimony told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that Bosasa paid Jiba bribes of R100 000 together with her former colleague Lawrence Mrwebi. Agrizzi told the inquiry that he had no direct evidence of cash handovers to them. Justice Zondo says he will still consider the matter. “My inclination is to dismiss the application to cross examine or if we think it might be better to postpone it and deal with it maybe when other witnesses have come forward. But I certainly intend to grant Ms Jiba leave to give evidence if she wants to.” Jiba’s attorney, Advocate Zola Majavu, appealed to Justice Zondo not to dismiss Jiba’s application. “Chair, I would rather you do not dismiss right now. Let this application perhaps stand over to when everybody else that might corroborate if Mr Agrizzi has either done that or distanced themselves from that.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
