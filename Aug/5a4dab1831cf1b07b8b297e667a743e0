The community of Ivory Park, north of Johannesburg, has threatened to march to the Eskom head office in Sunninghill if power is not restored to the area soon. Residents have been without electricity for the past two months. Last week, they took to the streets demanding that power be restored. A meeting between the community and Eskom at the Ivory Park Stadium on Monday failed, after representatives of the power utility pulled out at the eleventh hour, claiming safety concerns. “What we said to them is that come to our communities, talk our communities. As Councillors, we call meetings every three months. Come to these meetings, make people aware. If you can’t do that, we used to have road shows, community outreach. Go to communities, talk to them; tell them how important it is for them to buy electricity, not to bridge it. And not to do the buy-one-get-one-free, so that at least you are able to make money in Ivory Park; while you make your customer happy and all that,” says  Ward Councillor Thomas Maluleke.
