Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba will know today if he will continue to be in charge of the city following the results of a motion of no confidence tabled by the African National Congress (ANC). The ANC says it is confident that it has secured the 136 votes required to unseat Mashaba. The party accuses Mashaba of being responsible for the poor financial status of the City of Johannesburg since he took over three years ago. ANC’s regional secretary in Johannesburg Dada Morero maintains that their motion is intended simply to save the City. Morero says, “We are now experiencing an amount of more than R2 billion in over expenditure, we are now sitting at R2 billion of overdraft at city power which used to be a cash cow of the city. Most issues relate to how the finances of the city have been handled and we believe have a very negative effect which will lead to the city collapsing.” WATCH
