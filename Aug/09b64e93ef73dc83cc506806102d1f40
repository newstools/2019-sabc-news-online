The family of a six-year-old girl who died after she was caught in crossfire in Lavender Hill on the Cape Flats says they are struggling to come to terms with their loss. Nathalia Pienaar was hit during a shootout outside her home. She later died at a nearby hospital. Her aunt, Tracy Kruger, says she will be sorely missed. “We are very sad because she was only six years old and it’s not easy for us to see her go like that. She was still so young.”
