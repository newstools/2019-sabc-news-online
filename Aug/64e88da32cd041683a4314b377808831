Judge Irma Schoeman is on Wednesday expected to rule in an application to appeal against the indictment and authorised certificate in the sex case of pastor Timothy Omotoso in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. Defence attorney Peter Daubermann pointed out discrepancies between the two documents, while state prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa argued that there was no need for more detail or new documents. Judge Schoeman said it might be necessary for the Supreme Court of Appeal to decide as it is a matter of law. The defence is challenging the jurisdiction of the court, as some of the 97 sex offences were committed in various parts of the country.
