The High Court in Pretoria will on Thursday morning hand down judgment in the matter involving President Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Judgment was reserved last week. Ramaphosa approached the High Court seeking an interim interdict against Mkhwebane’s findings. In her report, Mkhwebane pronounced that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan unlawfully authorised the early retirement of then SA Revenue Service (SARS) deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. Last week, Mkhwebane’s legal representative Dali Mpofu argued that the President must implement the Public Protector’s remedial action on Gordhan. Mpofu argued that Ramaphosa was not entitled to an order. “All in all the application must be dismissed in all its forms, because there’s no declaratory. And because you can’t postpone what you say you’ve done.” In his defence, the Presidency argued it cannot do that, pending the outcome of the review case by Gordhan.
