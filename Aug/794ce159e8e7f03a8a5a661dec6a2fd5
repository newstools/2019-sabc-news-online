The IFP has released the name of the IFP councillor who was shot and killed in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday night. He was Mthembeni Majola who worked for the Nkosi Langalibhalele Local Municipality in Estcourt. Details about the shooting are still sketchy, but it is believed that Majola was travelling with two occupants in his car when they were attacked by unknown men. Majola is said to have died on the scene while the other two were rushed to hospital. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala says charges of murder and attempted murder are being investigated by Estcourt police. Majola was arrested in May last year for plotting to kill the former Speaker of the eNdumeni Local Municipality Bongiwe Mbatha and the owner of a security company Mofat Mosia. He was arrested together with the former Mayor Richard Mbatha and alleged hitman Xolani Makhathini. Majola and his co-accused were facing two charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Following the arrest, the IFP recalled Mbatha as Mayor. Majola continued to serve as a ward councillor. His trial was set to resume in November. Watch related videos belowâ€¦
