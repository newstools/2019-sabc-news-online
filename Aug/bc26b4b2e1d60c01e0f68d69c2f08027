The Gauteng government plans to stop foreigners from opening certain businesses in the province. Premier David Makhura says there are certain industries that only locals should be allowed to participate in. He was addressing the Gauteng legislature during an oral question and answer session on Tuesday. Makhura says businesses that can easily be done by locals should not be done by foreigners. He says this will be part of the Township Economy Bill soon to be introduced in the legislature. “We feel very very strong, where we can’t have a situation where even the smallest type of economy in the township that is open for all kinds of traders where our local economy is able to do that, includes areas of industrialisation in certain tax sectors… we want to emphasise particularly black industrialists.” Makura’s comments come after several foreign-owned shops were subject to rampant looting in Soweto. Foreign-owned shops were looted to allegedly avenge the incidents that happened in the Johannesburg CBD, when foreign nationals attacked police during a raid on those who trade in counterfeit goods. Police confirmed that spaza shops were looted in Dobsonville, Rockville, Zola, Orlando, Meadowlands, Emndeni, Moletsane, White City and Zondi.
