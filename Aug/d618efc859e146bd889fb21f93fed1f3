The DA’s Federal Executive has reiterated its call for Parliament to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The party’s highest decision-making body has concluded a two-day meeting in Johannesburg. In the latest development, the IFP has requested that the Public Service Commission and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice investigate the office of the Public Protector – following a string of court rulings against the Public Protector. DA Chairperson of the Federal Executive James Selfe says Mkhwebane is out of her depth. “The Federal Executive reaffirmed the party’s stance that Public Protector Advocate Mkhwebane is unfit to hold office and that Parliament must institute an inquiry as soon as possible. The office of the Public Protector is a crucial Chapter 9 institution tasked with posturing accountable democracy. Under Mkhwebane’s tenure, it has been reduced to a combative arm of a certain faction within the ANC. She must be removed at once.” Click on the related video below:
