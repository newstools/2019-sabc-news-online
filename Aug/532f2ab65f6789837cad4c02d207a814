Economist Mike Schussler has welcomed the release by Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni of a new document outlining the country’s economic approach to increasing growth and creating jobs. Mboweni wants the public to make comments on a paper titled: ‘Economic transformation, inclusive growth and competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa’. The paper has been published on the National Treasury’s website. It proposes the opening up of ports, rail and spectrum to more competition. It urges municipalities to correct their over-reliance on electricity revenue and that an independent electricity transmission company be created from the unbundling of Eskom. Schussler says the document will help with discussions about fixing the economy. He says, “While some unions may oppose it, it is a very sensible document and we know that we need labour intensive growth, we have to bring in more smaller medium sized business to create jobs and reduce red tape, something we have to have real discussion on.” Click below to watch related video:
