Police Minister Bheki Cele says the police in Cape Town are readying themselves to deal with the issue of murder and gangsterism on the Cape Flats once the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has been withdrawn. The army was deployed to various crime hotspots in the area to deal with rampant gangsterism and the high number of murders. The Police Minister was briefing the media in Mitchells Plain on the progress made during Operation Lockdown, which began on the 18th of July when the army arrived in the area. Cele also says the deployment of the army in some parts of the Cape Flats has produced some good results. More than 1 000 people have been arrested so far. He says 20 gang members are facing prosecution. “The feedback that I received up to this point is that people are happy and the support they give to the police is enough and as expected for the police. The members of the Defence Force, they give support as per the police,” says Cele.
