The rand has weakened by around one per cent against a basket of major currencies in mid-morning trade, following a stronger dollar. The dollar strengthened overnight after the US Federal Reserve cut its interest rates by 25 basis points to 2.25%. However, this was less than the market expected, which strengthened the dollar, especially in light of the Fed indicating that this cut was not the beginning of a series of rate cuts. A stronger dollar usually weakens the rand. The rand is currently trading close to R14.50 to the dollar from Wednesdayâ€™s Johannesburg Stock Exchange closing price of R14.15.
