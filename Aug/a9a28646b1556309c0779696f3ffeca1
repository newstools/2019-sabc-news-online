Parliament says it has received court papers from the lawyers of sacked National Prosecuting Authority head Nomgcobo Jiba. Parliament is one of the respondents in Jiba’s court bid to set the Mokgoro findings aside and to get her job back. Jiba was fired by President Cyril Ramaphosa in April following the findings and recommendations of retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro’s report. The report stated that Jiba’s conduct showed a lack of conscientiousness on multiple occasions. Jiba has approached the High Court in Cape Town not only to set the Mokgoro’s report which found her unfit to hold office aside, but she also wants to interdict the National Assembly not to go ahead to confirm President Ramaphosa’s decision to fire her. In addition she wants her salary to be reinstated pending the outcome of the parliamentary process. Parliament has confirmed that it has received correspondence of Jiba’s court papers. Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise is applying her mind to Jiba’s court papers. Meanwhile President Cyril Ramphosa’s Spokesperson Khusela Diko says the Presidency declines to comment on Jiba’s court bid to interdict the President.
