Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that he believes United States (US) President Donald Trump will not allow ties between the two NATO allies to become captive to a dispute over Ankara’s purchase of a Russian S-400 defence system. Speaking to Turkish ambassadors in Ankara, Erdogan also said there is no evidence that S-400 missile defence system will harm US F-35 stealth fighter jets.
