Three women have been killed on the R40 near Barberton. Preliminary investigations reveal that the two vehicles were travelling in the same direction. The red one collided with the SUV. Both overturned and flew over the bridge. Exhaustion and speeding are believed to be the cause. Gabsile Shabalala, the Mpumalanga Community Safety Security and Liaison MEC, says: “In this crash three females lost their lives. Because it was in the early hours of the morning, its highly possible that they were tired.” With higher traffic volumes expected this weekend, authorities have urged road-users to exercise caution.
