The African National Congress (ANC) has expressed concern at the raging legal battle between the party president Cyril Ramaphosa and the Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The High Court in Pretoria will on Monday hear Ramaphosa’s urgent judicial review application of Mkhwebane’s Bosasa report. This relates to the leaking to the media of confidential banking information of recipients and donors to Cyril Ramaphosa’s CR 17 campaign. Ramaphosa’s lawyers do not want the record of donors to be made public. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says they want the matter to be laid to rest and Ramaphosa be given the space to do his job.
