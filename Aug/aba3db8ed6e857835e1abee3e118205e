Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has accused the Human Rights Commission (HRC) in Gauteng of conducting its business in bad faith and playing politics. Mokgalapa was responding to the commission’s findings published on social media on the status of water at Hammanskraal. The commission found that water in that area is toxic and not suitable for human consumption. Mokgalapa says the city has never received a formal report on the matter. “It is quite sad that others decide to act in bad faith. We had our cards open and said we will walk the road with the Human Rights Commission because we understand the importance of this matter. “We said let us make sure that when we do tests we communicate with one another and HRC decided to do their own tests. They then decide to go on Twitter and Facebook without coming to us,” says Mokgalapa.
