Ten people have been arrested for allegedly being found in possession of suspected stolen property, while seven others have been nabbed for alleged public violence following the looting of foreign-owned shops in the Pretoria CBD.  Police say they will continue to monitor the situation after the looting during a violent protest following the gunning down of a taxi driver allegedly by a drug peddler. This resulted in clashes between taxi operators and a group of people believed to be involved in dealing drugs. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says taxi industry representatives have distanced themselves from the incident. “The taxi industry representatives have distanced themselves from the incidents of looting that took place in the Pretoria CBD, and have reiterated on behalf of their operators that there was no aggression on their part. Mr. Mack Makata of SANTACO said that they had planned for a demonstration to highlight some of their issues with the shooting of one of them and they believe some criminal elements took advantage and exploited the plan to advance their criminal intent.” Click on the videos below:
