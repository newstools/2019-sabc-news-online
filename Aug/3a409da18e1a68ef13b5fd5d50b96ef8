Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has given taxi owners an ultimatum to hand in unroadworthy vehicles by next week. Mbalula has launched the second phase of the Taxi Recapitalisation Program at Elandsfontein, south of Johannesburg. The program seeks to rid the road of unroadworthy taxis The government, in turn, pays them for the unroadworthy vehicles.  The Department has already scrapped over 70 000 vehicles since 2006.  Mbalula has warned taxi operators that if they don’t hand in unroadworthy vehicles, they will be impounded. “The taxi industry leadership was invited for today’s occasion and they chose not to come and I think they’ve got their own issues and demands. Now we will engage with them on understanding the issues that they want to raise with the minister from Santaco and everybody involved. But recapitalisation programme is not going to stop.”
