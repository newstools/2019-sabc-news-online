Former African National Congress (ANC) president Jacob Zuma has arrived in Ixopo in southern KwaZulu-Natal. Zuma is expected to deliver the Johannes Phumani “Pass Four” Phungula memorial lecture. Zuma had worked with Phungula for more than 40 years. Hundreds of ANC members have filled the hall to its capacity; amongst them is ANC KwaZulu-Natal provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli. Phungula died at the age of 77 in August of 2009. He was affectionately known as Pass Four which refers to the knock-off time for workers during the apartheid era so that they could avoid detention by policemen who were coming on duty. Phungula’s legacy lives on years after his death. Phungula joined the ANC in 1952 and immediately became a volunteer at the height of the defiance campaign while working as a migrant worker at Joko Tea in Durban.
