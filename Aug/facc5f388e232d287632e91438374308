KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has joined those who are conveying messages of condolences to the families of the victims of Saturday night’s crash in the province’s Midlands. Seven people including six maidens were killed when the minibus they were travelling in overturned and caught fire. The driver of the taxi also died. They were returning from an event organised ahead of next month’s annual Reed Dance in Nongoma. The premier’s spokesperson Bongani Tembe says they will ensure that the affected families receive the necessary support including counselling. “The premier has made a commitment that the Department of Transport in the province will make sure that the taxis and buses which will be transporting the maidens to the Reed Dance festival next month will be thoroughly inspected to ensure that we don’t have accidents of this nature again.” Nine other occupants were also injured in the crash.
