The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (SAMWU) has reached an agreement with the management of the City of Tshwane over the salary dispute that led to a four-day strike in the city. City of Tshwane Acting Mayor, Abel Tau, says they are happy with the decision. “We reached an agreement that would be palatable to the unions; and the employees would be satisfied with what we put in the table. We are also happy that we lived up to principle. I think the most difficult thing to do in this one was to find a correct balance and I do think we have found a correct balance that does expose the city to financial arrears yet we can go back to ensure that the capital functions.”  Tau says the city will be returning to normal on Friday and services will be restored. The agreement will see Workers earning R20 000 and less per month receiving a once off payment of R15 000 and those earning R30 000 and more will receive a once off payment of R7 000.  The protest follows the City of Tshwane’s decisions to upgrade salaries of top executives by 18% dating back to 2017, only to leave out lower level employees. Members of SAMWU had been on strike since Monday, demanding a similar wage hike. The strike has caused major disruptions in the Pretoria CBD, where the workers have been blockading some roads with buses and trucks. Watch a related video below:
