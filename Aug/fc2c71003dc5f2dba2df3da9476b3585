The South African Communist Party General-Secretary, Dr Blade Nzimande says they remain steadfast behind President Cyril Ramaphosa’s leadership even as more revelations are coming out regarding the CR17 campaign monies. On Sunday the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) confirmed that its MP Tebogo Mokwele did receive money from the CR17 campaign account. Mokwele confessed that she received a total of R40 000, saying that Ramaphosa assisted with a bereavement she had in her family. Dr Nzimande says there is nothing wrong with what Ramaphosa has done. “Those who are fighting back against President Ramaphosa are fighting against the interests of this country. It’s unfortunate all this is distracting us from what should be our primary focus. The primary focus of the movement of the country now is the economy. Also there has been rogue intelligence activities. I wouldn’t be surprised that these  monies that they’re talking about of the President that the information was actually acquired illegally.
