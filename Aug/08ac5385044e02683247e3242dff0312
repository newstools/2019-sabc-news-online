The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State has filed an urgent court application to stop the Metsimaholo municipality from removing some Sasolburg residents who have occupied land. The EFF in the province has encouraged the community to occupy land that has been approved for residential purpose by the municipality. The party says the African National Congress (ANC) councillors had initially allocated certain people sites on municipal land, but when the EFF does the same, the municipality removes them. Busanku Msimang is the EFF member in the Free State legislature responsible for human settlement. “We are just emphasizing on what the Executive Mayor has been saying. We are simply saying people when they see sites, especially which have been evaluated, which have been surveyed, we are saying they must go and occupy. When they see unoccupied land they must go and occupy given that the land has been surveyed, there are taps that side and then councillors of ANC have also taken people to that side. The very same Metsimaholo in Thabo Mbeki Section, there was a programme of occupy the unoccupied land led by the ANC, it can be different when is led by other people,” explains Msimang.
