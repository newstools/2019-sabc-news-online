Black First Land First (BLF) has called on the African National Congress (ANC) to immediately suspend Cyril Ramaphosa as its President and remove him as Head of State. The BLF’s call refers to the publication by News 24 of several emails and the names of people who were approached for funding by Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign managers. The publication says the emails have been verified. The BLF says the leaked emails show that Ramaphosa is compromised, conflicted and corrupt. The BLF says Ramaphosa claims to be fighting corruption, whilst being the most corrupt. The Presidency has responded by questioning whether or not the leaked emails were published legally. Presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko says the President was not involved in soliciting money from potential donors for his ANC presidential campaign in 2017. Diko says instead the President has donated his personal money into the campaign. Watch a related video below:
