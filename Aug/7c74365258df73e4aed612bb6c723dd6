The magistrate in the hate speech case of Adam Catzavelos has recused himself. The Human Rights Commission wants the Equality Court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg to declare Catzavelos’ use of the K-word, discriminatory and hate speech. Catzavelos was expected to appear in the court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court north of Johannesburg on Monday morning. The case relates to an incident in August last year in which he allegedly made racial comments while on holiday in Europe. He made a video which went viral on social media. Catzavelos faces a charge of crimen injuria.
