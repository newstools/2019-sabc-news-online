The Automobile Association (AA) says the weakness in the Rand is expected to negatively affect the fuel price for next month. According to the latest unaudited data from the Central Energy Fund, 95 octane could rise by 10 cents a litre, and diesel by 25 cents. Illuminating paraffin is also expected to climb by 21 cents. However, 93 octane could decrease by three cents a litre. The AA has emphasised the need for policy stability to provide protection for the Rand.
