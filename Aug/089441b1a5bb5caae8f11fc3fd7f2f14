The fire that blazed through St Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape has destroyed 12 houses. <span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> The affected families say the ordeal has traumatised them with some already planning to rebuild their houses. Thomas Jachens has been living in his St Francis house for more than 20 years. He says he managed to salvage some of the family property from the flames. “We are feeling devastated. The house that is more than 20-years-old has effectively been destroyed so we will have to start from scratch again. Fortunately some of the furniture was rescued but we have to start to pick up the pieces and rebuild the house to where it was again.”  Fire teams and a helicopter from Port Elizabeth assisted in dousing the fires near the golf course.
