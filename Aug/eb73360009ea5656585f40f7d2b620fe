The African National Congress (ANC) has withdrawn the motion of no confidence against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. The party says they have decided to withdraw the motion and table it again in the next two weeks. The much-anticipated motion of no confidence would have been advanced by the ANC, who say they are trying to save the municipality from collapsing. ANC councillor Loyiso Masuku says they will be tabling the motion again in September. “Speaker, fellow councillor, I rise in terms of rule 95.3 in the standing rules and orders of Council. As the ANC, we would like to withdraw the motion for today and we will re-table it in the next month. Sizobuya second half (we will be back again).” ANC’s Geoffrey Makhubo explaining why the party withdrew the motion of no confidence against Mayor Mashaba #MashabaMustGo #HandsOffMashaba #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/xdQDxtGHo2 — angela bolowana (@angybee) August 22, 2019  Mashaba says he’s disappointed that the ANC withdrew its motion of no confidence against him, saying he wanted the matter resolved once and for all. A very sarcastic Mashaba says the withdrawal is just a delaying tactic by the ANC so it can try and buy more votes in the council for its motion. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
