South African organisation ‘U-Dream Global‘ has released the names of the two South Africans killed in a plane crash in Tanzania. Project directors at U Dream, Des Werner, and Werner Froneman died when their plane crashed early on Saturday shortly after take-off from Tabora airport in the west of the country. Werner and  Froneman were bringing the plane home after it experienced technical difficulties on an expedition. The plane, belonging to ‘U-Dream Global’ crashed after failure to carry a support team on the Cape to Cairo Challenge. The Tanzanian Civil Aviation Authority says the plane made a distress signal about engine failure before disappearing from radar. ‘U-Dream Global’ spokesperson Simon Manda says they appreciate the support that has been pouring in. “The respective wives Belinda and Werner’s wife have been informed… we are in touch with the Department of International Relations, the embassy in Tanzania who are frantically making plans for the bodies to come home, and all the logistics that are involved… so there has been great support from the Aviation industry, from the Department itself, and everybody that knew of the trip.” U-Dream Global made international headlines in June when a group of students successfully built a four-seater Sling aircraft and then flew it from Cape Town to Cairo in July.
