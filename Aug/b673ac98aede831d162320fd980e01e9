The IFP says it will release a statement on Saturday following the killing of one of the partyâ€™s councillors from Estcourt in KwaZulu-Natal. The man whose name has not been released yet, was apparently shot and killed. IFP spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa says they are still liaising with law enforcement agencies to establish the details of the shooting. The councillor was from the Nkosi Langalibalele municipality in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. He was arrested last year together with a former Mayor for allegedly plotting to kill the former Speaker of the eNdumeni municipality.
