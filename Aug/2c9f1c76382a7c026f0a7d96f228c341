The DA says it is waiting to hear from the National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise after sending a letter saying it is concerned that the National Health Insurance Bill will not pass constitutional muster. The DA says it will ask Parliament to seek a comprehensive legal opinion on the matter. The DA leader Mmusi Maimane says he has written to Modise to request her to urgently instruct the Parliamentary Legal Services to obtain a legal opinion on the Bill. Maimane says the Bill appears to remove provincial competencies when it comes to health care.
