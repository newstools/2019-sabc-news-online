Thousands of Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) supporters in Harare are expected to march against the Zimbabwe’s worsening economy and poor living standards. This is despite government’s warning that the mass demonstrations will be stopped. The MDC says the protests will be peaceful. However, they want to register their dissatisfaction with government’s handling of the power outages, increased hyper-inflation and fuel shortages amongst other things. Spokesperson Daniel Molokele says this protest is one of many to come. “We are going ahead and not just on Friday. It’s a series – it’s a permanent process until we resolve issues. On Friday we are going ahead. On Monday – Bulawayo; Tuesday Gueru, on Wednesday -Masvingo and on Thursday Mutare and we will continue to roll out town by town; city by city.”
