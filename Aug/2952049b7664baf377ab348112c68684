The search for missing University of Cape Town (UCT) student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, has intensified. Three private investigators have been roped-in to help look for the 19-year-old. The first year student was reportedly last seen on the 24th of August. UCT spokesperson, Elijah Moholola, says finding her is a top priority: “In addition to the work being carried out by the SAPS and UCT’s own campus protection services, three private investigators have been appointed by the family, the University and Roscom House where she stays. The University and the family continue to appeal to anyone who might have any information that might assist in anyway with the search to urgently contact the SAPS. We remain very hopeful that Uyinene will be found soon.”
