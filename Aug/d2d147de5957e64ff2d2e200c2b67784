As thousands of Zion Christian Church pilgrims are heading to Moria outside Polokwane for the annual September gathering, the Department of Transport in Limpopo has warned motorists to be cautious on the road as heavy traffic is expected. The church will also consecrate the New Year over the weekend. Limpopo Transport MEC Dickson Masemola has urged motorists to be patient. “This weekend starting today (Friday) until Sunday is gonna be very busy in the province because it is a weekend for the Moria pilgrimage where millions of members of the church will be coming to our province. I want to call upon all road users coming from different places in our country heading towards the centre of the province and the city of Moria in particular to drive with caution with love.”
