The Department of Water and Sanitation in the Western Cape unveiled an early warning drought and flood system in the Keurbooms River area in Plettenberg Bay in the Southern Cape. The weir gauge is one of over 300 water measuring points that have been installed throughout the province to manage water resources. Hydrology division’s Leon Davids says, “Now that we in a drought, we need to know precisely what is the volume of water in the river because certain municipalities take water from the river. We also need to know the amount of water within the river because if we don’t have that information we cannot manage the water resource, that is especially true when it comes to droughts.” “This region is in a terrible drought, we are concerned with the amount of water within the region – with dam level extremely low,” added Davids.
