President Emmerson Mnangagwa has called on Zimbabweans to cherish the relative peace that is currently prevailing in the country. He was speaking at Defence Force Day celebrations that were held in Harare on Tuesday. As the opposition braces itself for the much anticipated mass nationwide demonstrations – Mnangagwa says citizens must stay vigilant and reject those who wish to perpetuate violence, disunity and unrest. He has also challenged the Defence Force to continue to be loyal to the country. “I challenge the ZDF to always be mindful of the fact that building and developing a new Zimbabwe requires a force which is loyal, patriotic, and reliable and committed.” “I further urge you to remain resourceful and vigilant towards enhancing and guarding against contemporary threats to our democracy and security.”
