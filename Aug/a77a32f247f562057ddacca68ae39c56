A report by the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) has identified the failure of watch keeping during a bunkering service of a trade vessel as the reason for the oil spillage in Algoa Bay last month. Between 200 and 400 litres were lost. The vessel was being refuelled when fuel spilt into the ocean off the Port of Ngqurha. SAMSA acting CEO Sobantu Tilayi says the vessel was fined R350 000. “Whenever a ship takes bunkers, there is supposed to be a ship crew that makes sure all the pumping goes appropriate, watch the spills, all the valves are left closed, the valves that should be closed. Now two things happened with that ship, they forgot one valve and not closed the overflow valve and the second part they should have been there.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
