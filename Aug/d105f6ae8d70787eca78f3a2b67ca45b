Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she will divulge further details at a later stage after she withdrew her application to the Constitutional Court.  She had sought to seek leave to appeal the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria on the findings in the matter of the so-called rogue unit. Judge Sulet Potterill had earlier granted the Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan the application to suspend the implementation of the remedial action that Mkhwebane had ordered against him in her report on the  South African Revenue Service  (SARS) investigation unit. Mkhwebane says she will give her reasons for the withdrawal in due course. “We will give more details but then we are discussing with the legal team and we will be focusing on another strategy as far as that matter is concerned, so we will give more details as time goes on.” Meanwhile, on the National Assembly’s recent attempt to remove her from office following the Democratic Alliance‘s (DA) complaint that she is incompetent, Mkhwebane says she is not opposed to the process if it is done within the law. “I’m welcoming that process as long as it is done within the law and also if it is not only focusing on this Public Protector and this incumbent. But it is a process that will then guide the country on the removal of a Chapter 9 Institution head, including the others who are commissioners.” Click below for more on the story:
