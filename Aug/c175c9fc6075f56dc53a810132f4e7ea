The fate of embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will be announced on Monday. The African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Working Committee in KwaZulu-Natal, tasked to investigate Gumede’s fitness to hold office, has tabled its report before a Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) meeting in Durban. Gumede was forced to take a special leave of absence by the ANC in June. She and six other eThekwini Metro officials are implicated in a R208 million solid waste tender fraud. Gumede’s woes were further compounded after the eThekwini region which she chaired was disbanded. The party has tasked a team under the Provincial Working Committee ( PWC) to investigate Gumede’s fitness to hold office and to report on the state of the municipality and That report has been concluded. It’s not just Gumede who was being investigated. Suspended Newcastle Mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba’s future was also discussed. Mahlaba is facing a murder charge. “The committee that deals with that report were meant to report in the PWC and it has been able to report in relation to eThekwini and it hasn’t been able to report in relation to Newcastle because they are different kind of comrades there who have not been able to finalise their tasks. So the PWC received the eThekwini report and is going to be presented today and the PEC will engage on it,” says KZN ANC spokesperson, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu. The party says it will only make the report public after concluding its three-day meeting on Monday. Gumede is due to appear in Durban’s Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday. Watch video below:
