The office of the Public Protector says it will challenge a ruling by the High Court in Pretoria which found that Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane failed the people of the country, in the manner in which she dealt with her investigation into the Estina Dairy Farm project. The DA and the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution argued last year that Mkhwebane failed to investigate politicians implicated in corruption relating to the project. Mkhwebane’s spokesperson Oupa Segwale says the High Court ruling should not be viewed in isolation. Segwale says the ruling is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the facts. “This recent judgment should not be viewed in isolation, it is part of one which was handed down in May. She has been waiting for this part to be dealt with so that she can put heads together with her legal team to start looking at how it is going to be challenged in court because she strongly believes that a different court will arrive at a different conclusion given the facts.” He adds:”For instance, this Estina matter was concluded in 2015, a year before she came into office. So people don’t look at what she found when she came into office.” Meanwhile, the Inkatha Freedom Party says it has requested the Public Service Commission and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development to investigate the entire staff of the office of the Public Protector.
