Lobby group, AfriForum, has warned that it will consider private prosecution against Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula should the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) fail to take action against him. This follows the Public Protector’s findings that Mbalula’s family holiday to Dubai in 2017 was funded by sporting goods supplier, Sedgars. Mbalula was Sports Minister from November 2010 to March 2017 and was helped by the firm when he failed to settle the bill for the lavish holiday. AfriForum’s Monique Taute says they have laid criminal complaints of money laundering and corruption against Mbalula. “The NPA’s failure to prosecute Mbalula on the PP’s recommendations has compelled AfriForum to lay these charges. We hope the NPA will do their job and the case will be investigated.” “We believe that Mbalula had unfairly benefitted from this relationship. In the case the NPA does not take the appropriate steps, AfriForum has its own private prosecution unit and we will be looking at private prosecution as we believe there is a prima facie case if you look at the report of the PP.” WATCH BELOW:
