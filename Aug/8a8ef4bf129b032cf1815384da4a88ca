The African Transform Movement (ATM) has expressed shock at the circulating pictures on social media, about people who are said to be former party members. This follows the launch of a new political party, the African Federal Convention (AFCO) in Johannesburg on Wednesday. AFCO leader Babayi Vusi Mathe had initially told SABC News that he was one of the founding members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). But, EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu took to Twitter saying Mathe and his team were former members of the ATM.  ATM President Vuyolwethu Zungula says, “As ATM we don’t recognise those peoples pictures circulating, purporting to be from ATM. And according to the membership records, they don’t appear. So we have no idea where ATM is involved in the formation of this new political party.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
