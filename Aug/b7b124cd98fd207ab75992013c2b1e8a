The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) Secretary-General Apa Pooe says the party will hold its national elective congress this weekend in Bloemfontein with the aim of unifying the party. Delegates have already started to arrive at the conference venue for registration. Pooe has admitted that infighting has weakened the party. “The theme of the conference precisely is to emphasise on the unity of this organisation. We know that our organisation was bedevilled by factionalism, by divisions; and for once this organisation will be united. We are going to come together under the same roof and allow members to elect their own leadership.” Last weekend another faction of the party held its own congress where Narius Moloto was re-elected as the party president.
