ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule has announced an interim provincial committee to lead the ANC in the Western Cape for the next nine months. Magashule says the team to be led by Lerumo Kalako will ensure the unity of the party from the branch levels in the run-up to the provincial congress 2020. The interim structure composed of 15 men and 15 women includes party veterans such as Ebrahim Rasool and James Ngculu. One of the first tasks of the Provincial Interim Committee would be to ensure that branches are ready for regional conferences. Magashule says he has all confidence in the interim provincial leadership. “We are starting a new chapter in rebuilding and renewing the African National Congress. We have men and women who are now going to drive this province. Comrade Lerumo Kalako, he is the converner of the province, which term of office is nine months to ensure that we go to conference,” says Magashule. Kalako says his first task is draw up a programme of action. “The main is to make sure we increase the number of branches we have and to strengthen the regions and look seriously into issues of governance. As you know, we are an opposition party in the province, our focus will be trying to assist both in the provincial legislature and also at local government.” The provincial interim committee has been given nine months to prepare for the provincial congress, but Magashule says there will be no need to wait until the end of this period. “If they are ready they will simply have to advise the national leadership.”
