The documents that the Public Protector obtained about the CR17 campaign for the African National Congress (ANC) presidency have been filed in the High Court in Pretoria. Mkhwebane’s evidence relates to a R500 000 Bosasa donation. She has not disclosed how she obtained the evidence. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s legal team wrote to the court to request that details linked to bank accounts related to the CR17 campaign not be made public. Mkhwebane made reference to e-mails when she found that Ramaphosa misled Parliament about the source of the Bosasa donation to his campaign. The court has suspended the remedial action in Mkhwebane’s Bosasa’s report. This means that for now, action will not be taken against Ramaphosa who says the report is legally flawed.
