Metrorail services in Cape Town continue to be disrupted following cable theft over the weekend, which left at least 27 trains stationery. Following cable thieves’ attempt to steal critical infrastructure in Salt River on Sunday,  that triggered a high voltage surge that damaged the equipment room and other infrastructure. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott says cables were also vandalised and stolen between Kentemade station and Ysterplaat, as well as Hazendal and Langa in Cape Town. Scott said, “The train service status is unchanged from yesterday. We have had 27 plus cancellations this morning. This is mainly in the Southern operating area because our network there does not allow us many deviations.” “On North its going a bit better. We will get a prognosis from the technical teams a little bit later and will issue an update for afternoon peak,” added Scott.
