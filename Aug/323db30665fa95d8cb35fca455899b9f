The Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane‘s legal representative Advocate Dali Mpofu says the President has not complied with the remedial action against Pravin Gordhan. The High Court in Pretoria is hearing an application against the Public Protector by President Cyril Ramaphosa who wants to have the remedial action against the Public Enterprises Minister temporarily suspended. Mkhwebane had found that Gordhan had unlawfully and improperly authorised former Sars Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay’s early retirement. Mpofu says the office of the Public Protector has to be respected. “It has become fashionable to make the kind of suggestions that have been made here about punitive calls and to insult the Public Protector and the dignity of that office as it has been done here, called corrupt and that she colluded with the state capture; this case is devoid of any merit whatsoever.” Click video below for more on the story:
