Hope may be on the horizon for those fighting the deadly Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This, after scientists with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced Monday that two potential drugs showed a survival rate of as much as 90% in a clinical trial. The two experimental drugs were developed with antibodies harvested from survivors of the Ebola infection. Authorities say they’ll now offer the treatments to all patients in the DRC. The trial began last November and has been conducted in four treatment centers across the country with some 681 patients enrolled. The promising results come amid the second largest Ebola outbreak in history. At least 1 800 people have died since it began spreading in eastern Congo last August. From 2013 to 2016, more than 11 300 people were killed in West Africa in the world’s largest ever Ebola outbreak. Officials said the trial’s positive findings were encouraging but not enough to stop the epidemic for good.
