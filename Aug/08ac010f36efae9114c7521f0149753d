It has emerged that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe will have to pay court costs as well as the R10 million in pension fund monies he received from the power utility. The Constitutional Court declined to even hear Molefe’s appeal. Molefe had wanted to challenge a High Court decision that he pay back part of the R30 million pension he received from the power utility. At the end of July, a quorum of eight Constitutional Court justices dashed Molefe’s hopes for a reprieve. The Constitutional Court declined to even hear the appeal saying it does not engage the court’s jurisdiction and bears no reasonable prospects of success. In a final blow, Molefe will have to pay the wasted costs of his application. The finding of the High Court, that he unlawfully enriched himself from the Eskom pension fund, now stands unassailed.
