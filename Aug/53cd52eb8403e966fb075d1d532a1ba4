Trade union, Solidarity says it will make sure that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe pays back the R10 million in pension payout money that he received. The Constitutional Court has dismissed Molefe’s leave to appeal against the High Court decision that he must repay the money. Earlier in 2019, the Pretoria High Court found that Molefe had enriched himself unlawfully when he received the cash. Solidarity’s Deon Reinecke says the union will not rest until Molefe has returned all the money including legal fees payments. “We will immediately start proceedings to collect the R10 million to be paid to the pension fund as well as the cost order of our legal team in excess of a million rand. We will do everything to collect that money. We will also ask the pension fund to do their part. We will go as far as repositioning property if he can’t pay back the money.”
