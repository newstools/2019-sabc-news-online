As election preparations get into full swing in Botswana, President Mokgweetsi Masisi has officially dissolved parliament. Permanent secretary for Government Communications Andrew Sesinyi says the dissolution came into effect at midnight. Botswana will vote in the general elections in October, in what is expected to be the toughest elections for the Democratic Party, which has ruled the country since its independence in 1965. This time, former President Ian Khama is working with and campaigning for the opposition, following a fall out between him and the incumbent, Masisi. In the previous elections, the alliance of opposition parties, Umbrella for Democratic Change won a record number of 20 seats in the 57 seater parliament, unseating the BDP in some constituencies.
