The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has called on judges to take independent decisions regardless of who comes before them in court. He was speaking at the party’s Women’s Day celebrations in Concordia near Springbok in the Northern Cape.  The EFF was in court this month in a bid to have the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s remedial actions against the Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan immediately implemented. Malema has warned that there will be consequences if the judiciary does not remain neutral. “If judges are going to judge according to who appears before them they must know that we’ll be left with no option but to take up arms because there is no neutrality in South Africa. The judges can save democracy in South Africa by not being biased because a biased judiciary will force us into the bush.”
