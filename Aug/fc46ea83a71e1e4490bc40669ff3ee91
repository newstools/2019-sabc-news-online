The PIC Commission of Inquiry resumes. On Tuesday the commission heard how the culture of fear crippled the organisation. Former PIC board member Sibusisiwe Zulu told the Inquiry she witnessed many incidents where staff members felt scared to answer certain questions or would resort to silence in fear of being victimised or losing their jobs. .Zulu added that the allegations leveled against her were malicious and without fact. According to allegations contained in the Nogu e-mails, businessman Laurence Mulaudzi had secured a number of deals from the PIC because of his love relationship with Zulu. She has denied this.
