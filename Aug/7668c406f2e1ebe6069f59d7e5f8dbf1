The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is expected to resume on Monday morning, in Parktown, Johannesburg, following a two-week break. It will continue with testimony about the controversial Estina dairy farm in Vrede in the Free State. Over R220-million in public funds was channelled to the project. A Gupta-linked company Estina led the project which the Free State government promoted as a tool to benefit black emerging farmers. The hearings are focused on the failed dairy project which was intended to benefit merging black farmers but was instead used to siphon off funds to allegedly benefit the Gupta family. Before the two-weeks break, the commission heard about fear and murders linked to the Estina dairy farm projects and the policeâ€™s alleged inaction when the death threats were reported. The then Free State premier Ace Magashule, who is now the ANC secretary-general and the former Agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane are among the alleged key facilitators of the deal. Agricultural Economist David Andreas Maree is expected to testify. Click on the video below:
