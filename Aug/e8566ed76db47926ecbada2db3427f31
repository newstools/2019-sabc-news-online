Striking workers from Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape have blockaded the N6 road in Stutterheim with burning tyres. Workers belonging to Samwu and Imatu are demanding a 6.5% wage increment. They are also calling for the removal of Municipal Manager, Thandekile Mnyimba and Corporate Services Director, Mziwodumo Dliwayo. Workers have been on strike for the past three weeks. Spokesperson for Imatu, Vusumzi Novukela says they won’t stop protesting until their demands are met. “We are trying to get a buy-in from the community, so that we get assistance from the community, because we believe that we are from the families. Our families will have supper power in so far as assisting us as the workers of Amathole Municipality.” The workers have been raising increment issue for weeks, see video below:
