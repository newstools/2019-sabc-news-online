President Cyril Ramaphosa has conveyed his condolences to the family of businesswoman Thandi Ndlovu, who died in a car crash near Rustenburg in the North West  on Saturday. Ndlovu was the former president of the Black Business Council in the Built Environment. Ramaphosa has described her as the most formidable pioneering and leading woman of the construction industry. Ndlovu joined the African National Congress military wing, ‘Umkhonto Wesizwe’, during the liberation struggle. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe describes the late Ndlovu: “She has had a great contribution towards the socio-economic transformation agenda of our country. She was a revolutionary par excellence. She was an outstanding business woman and has cared for our own stalwart veterans especially Ma Adelaide Tambo, Ma Kotane, Ma Ruth Mompati amongst others.” Family spokesperson, Mapaseka Mokwele says the funeral arrangements Ndlovu have not yet been finalised. “They have not been finalised as yet and we will obviously alert everyone once the family has made those decisions. It’s comes as a real shock, it’s comes as total shock for the family. We are hoping to have a memorial service as well.”
