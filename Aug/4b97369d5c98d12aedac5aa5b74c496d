The Hendrik Verwoerd High School in Pretoria has been renamed Rietondale High School. Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi announced the renaming after a two-year process.   Lesufi has in the past three months expressed that his mission is to reverse everything associated to the apartheid era. This is to provide an all-inclusive strategy to address issues that may be a threat to social cohesion in schools and thus impact negatively on learner performance. It is against this background that the department has developed a programme to rename schools that bear names and symbols of the apartheid era, those with derogatory names or names that schools and surrounding communities have no attachment to.
