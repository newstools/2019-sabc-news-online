The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will continue hearing former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana’s evidence on Wednesday morning in Parktown, Johannesburg. Dukwana, who is appearing for the second time, told the commission that a system of patronage and intimidation has created a culture of fear in the Free State province. Dukwana was fired as MEC by then former premier Ace Magashule in 2012. He told the commission that the system still exists. He says: “The system is continuing and up until you deal with the system you can do whatever, it will not help.” “You can put any person you think is better, they would not be able to do anything meaningful in that province up until you have dealt with the system that has been introduced in the Free State.”
