A non-profit advocacy group, the Right2Know Campaign, says anyone found responsible for editorial interference at the SABC must be brought to book. The group’s statement comes ahead of the release of the report that was investigating allegations of editorial interference at public broadcaster. Veteran journalist Joe Thloloe, who chaired the commission of inquiry, is expected to release the outcome of the investigations on Monday. Songezo Mazizi of the Right2Know Campaign says those guilty of wrongdoing must be held accountable. “As a Right2Know campaign we believe that accountability is important and also this report will be able to cleanse what is happening at the SABC knowing very well there are perpetrators within the SABC who have harassed workers at the SABC, those must be brought to book and be sent to law enforcement.” One of the so called “SABC Eight” journalists, Lukhanyo Calata, shares these sentiments. “I think of the reasons why the SABC is in a position that it has been, particularly editorially, has always been the fact that there’s never been consequence management. So and I think with them bringing up this report it is enforced that the recommendations of this report be followed through to the letter and for there to be consequence management.” Click video below:
