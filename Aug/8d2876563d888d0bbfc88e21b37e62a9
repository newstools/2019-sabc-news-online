North Korea is being accused of trying to raise money for nuclear weapons through cyber-crime. South Africa is one of the countries that North Korea has targeted by hijacking bank computers, among other things. North Korea tried to set up fake interbank transfers to steal cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. CEO of World Wide Worx Arthur Goldstuck says he is shocked at the sophistication of these attacks… “In fact, the world’s been quite shocked that North Korea has the sophistication to mount these kinds of attacks, but clearly as with their missile program national resources are thrown at it and when you can throw those kinds of resources at it you cannot only train people but also give them the tools that enable them to operate at the highest possible level. If you can build nuclear bombs you can certainly build cybersecurity bombs.”
