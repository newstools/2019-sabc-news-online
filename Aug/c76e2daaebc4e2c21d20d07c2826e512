Former Zimbabwean Vice President, Phelekezela Mphoko has been declared a fugitive from justice by the Zimbabwean anti-corruption Commission (ZACC). He failed to surrender himself to officers of the Commission on Monday in Bulawayo. Mphoko faces criminal abuse of office charges during his time as Vice President under former President Robert Mugabe and becomes the second high profile figure and former government official to be investigated by the ZACC. Former minister of Tourism Prisca Mupfumira was arrested last month on similar charges. It is reported that Mphoko who had resisted arrest on Saturday had agreed to surrender himself to police.
