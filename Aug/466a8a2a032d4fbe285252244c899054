The Hawks  have increased security for the lead investigator in the fraud and corruption case of eThikwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, after the man was shot and wounded last Friday, outside his home in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. Security is also being increased for other investigators probing similar cases. The shooting occurred last Friday – but details are only emerging now. Gumede is due back in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday on charges of fraud and corruption in connection with a R208-million tender for refuse removal.  Hawks spokesperson Hanguani Mulaudzi says they have enhanced security around members of the task team since the incident. “We can confirm that there was an attack on one of the task members . The incident took place in Johannesburg. The case itself is still under investigation we don’t know the motive but we have taken serious exception to this incident and hence we have now enhanced security measures around the members. But with this attack it means then that we need to take serious precautions in terms of making sure that in all these case, the clean audit cases be it in KZN, in Bloemfontein anywhere in the country their security is not compromised.” The African National Congress recently decided to extend the leave of absence of Gumede and the Newcastle Mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba who is facing a murder charge.
