The legal fraternity is lagging behind on women empowerment. This emerged at the debut Woza Awards held in Sandton on Saturday night. The awards recognise women who have blazed a trail in the legal practice. Woza Awards founder, Rahana Parker, says that Woza, Zulu for “come along,” is for women to come together and create a platform for themselves in the legal fraternity.
