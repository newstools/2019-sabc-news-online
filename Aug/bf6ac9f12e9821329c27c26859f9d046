Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) President Narius Moloto says liberation movements, including the PAC, have now lost touch with the masses during the democratic dispensation. Moloto says that most politicians want to be hero-worshipped by the people who elect them into Parliament. He was speaking during the eleventh national elective congress underway at Tompi Seleka outside Marble Hall in Limpopo. The other faction led by General Secretary Apa Pooe plans to hold its congress in Bloemfontein next week. Moloto says a political party like PAC should not be struggling for survival.  “We’ve just been too long in the political periphery in this country as a liberation movement, we’ve just been at some stage fighting for survival, a liberation movement of note, and the question of one seat in Parliament is totally unacceptable. Now this national congress must resolve that issue.” Moloto says the suspension of the party constitution has been lifted with immediate effect.  He had suspended the party constitution due to what he refers to as anarchists within the leadership of the party. The suspension of the party constitution gave powers to the party president to rule by decree. “Clause 14.2 of the disciplinary code of PAC gives the president of the PAC power to suspend the constitution, today (Saturday) I’ll report to you why I suspended that constitution, today (Saturday)   the suspension of the constitution is lifted,  anyone who’s trying to entertain it anywhere, either in court is irrelevant, the leadership of the PAC is elected not appointed.” On Friday the High Court in Pretoria granted one of the party’s factions an interdict stopping the conference, but that was appealed meaning the conference proceeded.
