The National Sea Rescue Institute has cautioned beach goers to be aware of when it is high tide when visiting the coast in Cape Town.  This comes after the NSRI was called in to assist with the rescue of two people who were trapped on a rock by the incoming high tide at Camps Bay on Saturday. NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, says they were brought back to shore unharmed. “On arrival on scene, three of the people that were trapped on the rock had managed to make it back to the mainland safely unassisted. Two people remained on the rock, a male and a female. The NSRI and Fire and Rescue Service Dive Unit set up a rope system and in relays, one after the other, they were brought safely to mainland. Both of them were not injured and no further assistance was required.”
