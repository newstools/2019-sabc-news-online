The South African Communist Party (SACP) General-Secretary Blade Nzimande has defended President Cyril Ramaphosa, saying he inherited an economy in crisis. Nzimande was speaking in Ermelo in Mpumalanga at celebrations to mark the 98th anniversary of the founding of the party in South Africa. Nzimande says State Owned Enterprises such as Eskom are in crisis because of the greed of certain people. He says the current energy crisis in the country is directly linked to state capture. “We want to say this firstly though that we reject this suggestion that the economy has been in difficulty since comrade Cyril Ramaphosa became the President of South Africa. It’s not true in fact. Part of the difficulty we are facing today in our economy is largely as a result of the billions of rands stolen through state capture.” Click video below:
