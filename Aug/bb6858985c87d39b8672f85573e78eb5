The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Tuesday continue hearing evidence regarding the controversial Estina Vrede Dairy Farm project in the Free State. More than R220-million allocated to the project intended to benefit black emerging farmers was siphoned off – to allegedly benefit the Gupta family. On Monday, the commission heard how Free State Treasury staff was pressured into making an R30-million prepayment to Gupta-linked Estina. Former Free State Treasury deputy DG, Anna Fourie has told the hearings in Parktown, Johannesburg that she was urgently pulled out of a function to process the payment on the same day she first heard of the project… “Just on the last two facts, the fact that the procurement processes were not followed and in the absence of a deviation approval. I then indicated that should the payment be received that would result in irregular procedure because the not normal procedures were not followed and what was not clear is that because we could not prove if the funds were not available that could result in unauthorised expenditure” Click on video below:
