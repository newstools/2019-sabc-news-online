Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) members are expected to elect new leadership on Saturday, during the party’s national congress being held in Bloemfontein. Acting PAC president, Mzwanele Nyhontso says the party will elect the leadership that will take the party forward.  The party has been marred by leadership squabbles. Delegates say they want the party to resolve its issues. “We want to see PAC growing like it did before with the time of Robert Sobukwe and other stalwarts. So it’s not like we really love what is happening in the PAC. We are here to unite the party; we are here to take the PAC forward as the generation and women.  PAC has been divided for a very long time. Now, we are here as the youth of PAC to support the unity of Africans.” Watch for more:
