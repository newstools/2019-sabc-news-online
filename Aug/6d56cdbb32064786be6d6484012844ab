A 14-year-old boy has been taken to a place of safety after he allegedly shot and killed his 12-year-old friend while they were playing in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg on Sunday. Police say the older boy got hold of a firearm belonging to his parents and fatally shot his friend. The 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital where he later died. Police spokesperson Steven Malatjie says the teenager has been taken to a place of safety. “Apparently last night (Monday) there was an incident where two friends aged 14 and 12 were playing and there was nobody supervising them. The 14-year-old managed to get hold of the parent’s firearm and shot the eye of the 12-year-old. The little one was taken to hospital but was confirmed dead.”
