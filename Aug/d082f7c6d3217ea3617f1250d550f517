The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Western Cape has reiterated their call to the African National Congress’s (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) to institute an investigation into the alleged misuse of elections funds in the Western Cape. The party was responding to the decision by the NEC to disband the ANC’s Provincial Executive Committe (PEC) in the Western Cape. SACP Provincial Secretary, Benson Ngqentsu says they also call for the immediate suspension of membership of all those implicated, pending the outcome. He has welcomed the decision to disband the PEC, saying the provincial ANC leadership has been at war with itself for too long and this has led to degeneration and loss of confidence from the supporters.
