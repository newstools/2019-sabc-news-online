Constitutional law expert, Shadrack Gutto, says President Cyril Ramaphosa has the right to approach the Deputy Judge President of the High Court in Pretoria to request that certain information contained in the records of the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane , should be not be disclosed to the public. Earlier, emails that suggest that Ramaphosa had knowledge of the CR17 fund raising campaign for ANC presidency were leaked to the media. This is contrary to earlier assertions that he was not involved. The President’s lawyers have accused Mkhwebane of unlawfully obtaining financial information from bank accounts linked to a company which she used in a report implicating Ramaphosa in money laundering. Last month, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa violated the Executive Ethics Code by misleading Parliament on the R500 000 Bosasa donation. Gutto says the President’s move will not affect the court cases against him . “From a constitutional point of view, the President has the right to make such a request and that will not actually affect the processes that are going on in court against the President as they stand at the moment.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
