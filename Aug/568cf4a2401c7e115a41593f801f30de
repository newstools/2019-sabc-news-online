The Equality Court in Pretoria has continued to hear the matter between the South African Editors’ Forum (SANEF) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). SANEF and a number of individual journalists have taken the EFF to court. They are arguing that the party has enabled an environment in which the intimidation and harassment of journalists is encouraged. This follows EFF leader Julius Malema’s remarks at a party protest outside the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, in November last year. He called on party supporters to deal decisively with certain journalists who he accused of defending white monopoly capital. On Monday, the EFF argued that SANEF’s litigation should be struck off the roll, saying the forum has no powers to initiate the court proceedings. Watch court proceeding below:
