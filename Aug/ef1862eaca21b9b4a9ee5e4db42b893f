The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union’s (AMCU) President, Joseph Mathunjwa, has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of being captured by white monopoly capital. Mathunjwa was addressing hundreds of people at an event in North West to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Marikana tragedy, when 34 miners were gunned down by police during a wage strike. A total of 44 people, including two policemen, were killed during the wage protests at Marikana. Mathunjwa lashed out at the leadership of the ANC, saying the Marikana tragedy had exposed the ruling party. “This day comrades exposed the ANC government that this is not the government for the people but this is the government for white monopoly capital. The blood of our fathers, the blood of our brothers has exposed that the real state capture is the ANC itself – being captured by the white monopoly capital,” says Mathunjwa.
