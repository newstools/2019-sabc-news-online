The South African Weather Service has launched a new state-of-the-art radar system in the Skukuza camp in the Kruger National Park, to detect hazardous weather conditions. The system will track areas that include Mpumalanga, Limpopo and some parts of neighboring countries eSwatini and Mozambique. Acting CEO of the Weather Service, Mnikeli Ndabambi, says the information from the radar will be provided to disaster management teams to take preventative measures. ” It’s not scanning for KNP only its only scan to Ermelo, to Pokwane and then overlaps with the Ermelo and Polokwane radar but also more important this area is affected by tropical cyclones,” says Ndabambi.
