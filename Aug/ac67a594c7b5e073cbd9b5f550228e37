The lawyer representing African National Congress’ (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) member Derek Hanekom, Advocate Carol Steinberg, says the reputation of her client has been negatively affected following remarks made against him by former President Jacob Zuma. Hanekom is suing Zuma for R500 000 for allegedly defaming him by calling him a known enemy agent. Steinberg says since the publication of Zuma’s tweet, Hanekom has endured insults and attacks. Some of them have been directed at his wife and their participation in the struggle.   Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, representing former President Jacob Zuma, has told the court that his client’s tweet about Hanekom being a known enemy agent, was not intended in the way it was interpreted. Sikhakhane has told the court Zuma was referring to Hanekom working with the EFF to oust him as President. ” If you read Mr Hanekom’s founding affidavit and notice of motion, he truly draws that dagger out there. It’s not even his dagger and after stabbing himself with it, finds comments of people to justify why he pulled a dagger lying there, as sharp as it is to stab himself. It was not intended at least by my client in that tweet.” Hanekom says he has a good legal team and he’s confident about the cases. He is expected to address his supporters after the proceedings.
