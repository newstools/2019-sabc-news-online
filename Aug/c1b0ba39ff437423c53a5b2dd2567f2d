Scores of voters have descended to one of the disputed polling stations in Ward 34 of the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality in the Free State. Both the Heavenly Economic and Political Freedom Programme (HEPFP) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) claim that the names of bogus people have been added on the votersâ€™ roll. The HEPFP has threatened to apply for an urgent court interdict prohibiting by-elections from going ahead. Some of the residents could be heard speaking to one another saying they are tired of the state of affairs in the Maluti-A-Phofung municipality in QwaQwa.
