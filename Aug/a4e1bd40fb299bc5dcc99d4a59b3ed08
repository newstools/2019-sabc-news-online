The swearing in of the new eThekwini Municipal mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has been postponed indefinitely after the incumbent, Zandile Gumede, withdrew her resignation. Gumede was placed on leave of absence for two months after being arrested on corruption charges in May. She was later told to resign over the poor delivery of basic services in the municipality. The withdrawal of Gumede’s resignation has thrown the African National Congress’ (ANC) plan to manage her removal into disarray. With no leadership, committee meetings have not been held for several weeks.
