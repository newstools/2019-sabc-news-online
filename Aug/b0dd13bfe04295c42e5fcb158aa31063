The children were on their way to school when the collision occured. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that 21 children had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Fortunately no serious injuries or fatalities were reported. The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further care. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations” says ER24’s Russell Meiring.
