Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she remains resolute to do her job, even in the face of punishing cost orders against her. Mkhwebane was speaking this week, after a majority Constitutional Court judgment refused to interfere with a personal cost order against her in the High Court in Pretoria. The cost order runs into thousands of rands and would have to be paid by Mkhwebane herself. It’s related to her investigation into the Reserve Bank’s lifeboat deal for Bankcorp. Mkhwebane says she will not be cowed and will also appeal a High Court decision suspending her remedial action against Public Enterprise Minister, Pravin Gordhan.  Watch related videos:
