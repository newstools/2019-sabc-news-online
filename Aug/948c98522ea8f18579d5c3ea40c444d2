The Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has withdrawn her application to the Constitutional Court in which she had sought to seek leave to appeal the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria on her findings in the matter of the so-called rogue unit. Judge Sulet Potterill had granted the Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan the application to suspend the implementation of the remedial action that Mkhwebane had ordered in her report on the South African Revenue Service (SARS) investigation unit. The Public Protector had announced her intention to appeal the judgment. Her spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says she is only withdrawing her appeal interdicting the remedial action related to the SARS investigation unit, not the entire report. “It is true that the Public Protector has withdrawn the application for direct access to the Constitutional Court where she was applying to appeal a judgment of the Pretoria High Court in respect of the so-called rogue unit matter, and that relates only to the interdicting of the remedial action in respect of that matter. It does not relate to the part of the matter which is the review of the report itself because that is still underway,” says Segalwe. Click below for more on the rogue unit:
