The radio audience measurement survey has indicated a significant growth for some of the SABC radio stations. The survey indicates that the biggest radio station in Africa, Ukhozi FM, now reaches a weekly audience of 7.7 million people. This is the largest audience the isiZulu language station has recorded since 2016. The SABC’s combined radio stations market share for January 2019 to June 2019 was 73.2% indicating a 1.4% increase compared to the 72.1% market share recorded for the same period last year. SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu says the public broadcaster is committed to delivering on its mandate in an increasingly competitive broadcasting landscape. The survey further shows another record breaking performance from the Afrikaans language station Radio Sonder Grense (RSG) which now records 1.3 million in its weekly audience. She says: “The daily delivery of content in indigenous South African languages is a key strength of the public broadcaster and these large audiences are testament to the trust that South Africans have in SABC radio. The SABC would also like to express its gratitude to the millions of South Africans for their loyalty and support.”
