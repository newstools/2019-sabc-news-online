Ninety-eight percent of people who talk about gender-based violence in television news are men. According to a study by Gender Links called “Gender, Diversity and GBV in South African TV”, women are still unheard in the media. The study was presented at the Step It Up for Gender Equality in SA Media conference held in Fourways, north of Johannesburg.

Gender Link’s Maximilian Vogt says women’s voices are hardly heard. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/738759">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
