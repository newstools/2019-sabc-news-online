Lawyers for pastor Timothy Omotoso have objected to the ruling of Judge Irma Schoeman, that the charge sheet is sufficient. Presiding Judge, Irma Schoeman said she was dismissing the application on the basis that the charge sheet is sufficient for the defence’s preparations of the trial. She denied his appeal. Defence Lawyer Peter Daubermann then threw a spanner in the works. Daubermann told Judge Schoeman that this court only has jurisdiction over 7 of the 97 charges on which the accused pleaded not guilty. Most other alleged offences were committed in the jurisdiction of other courts. 63 are main charges and 34 are alternative charges. They are sex related. Daubermann is of the view that the charges should be dealt with in the applicable regions.
