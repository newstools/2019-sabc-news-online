Former President Jacob Zuma says African National Congress (ANC) members need to be honest if they’re to be trusted by the public.  Zuma delivered a memorial lecture at Ixopo, in honour of late Defiance Campaign veteran Johannes Phungula. Phungula commanded the ANC’s Natal Machinery. The lecture saw ANC members gathered to honour the late struggle veteran who died in 2009. Phungula was affectionately known as Pass Four. Zuma, who was a close friend, paid tribute to his commander whom he described as an exemplary leader. Zuma steered clear of current political developments both in the province and nationally.  On Friday, the case of defamation against him by former minister Derek Hanekom was heard in the Durban High Court. Zuma briefly touched on the ongoing land debate.  He said the only way to end poverty is for the black majority to get their land back. Zuma urged ANC branch members to be actively involved in their communities.   This is one way, he said, the ANC could grow. Zuma has also revealed that Phungula had a sharp eye and was able to identify a spy within the ANC ranks while in exile. Zuma told ANC members who attended the lecture that Phungula was not a man who would easily go against ANC policy.
