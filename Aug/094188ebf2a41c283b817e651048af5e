The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) national elective congress has re-elected Narius Moloto as the party president. Moloto has been elected unopposed. The candidates for the other positions were also elected unanimously. Moloto is deputised by Benneth Joko. Phumzile Phasha is the first woman to be elected into the position of the Chairperson. The new Secretary-General is Phillip Dlhamini, his deputy is Kodisang Bokaba, Treasurer is Medupi Maile and National Organiser is Junior Ntabeni. Dlhamini says they are elated that the conference went smoothly. “The objective has been achieved, the rule by decree ended so there’s a new elected leadership of the PAC: Mr Moloto is the president, his deputy is Benneth Joko and I was elected Secretary General. I do not know of a branch that is not invited here.” Dlhamini says they will not seek court intervention to stop the other faction from holding its congress. The faction led by Apa Pooe is planning to hold its congress in Bloemfontein next week. It had earlier wanted to interdict the Moloto faction from holding its congress, but failed. Dhlamini says the Appeals Court will be the final arbiter on the legitimate leadership of the party. “That challenge is a challenge that leadership should deal with, the issue is before court, we cannot interfere with the law. Let the rule of law prevail, so we cannot go to court and try to stop them because the matter is before court.”
