Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema has described the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef’s) court application against them as a ploy to derail his party from its primary focus. Malema was speaking at the High Court in Pretoria after judgement was reserved the Equality Court in a case in which Sanef and five journalists are seeking an apology from Malema over the utterances they made against journalists. Sanef wants Malema and his supporters to be interdicted for their conduct, whereas EFF is asking the court to throw this matter out. Malema says the relief Sanef is seeking to gag the EFF. “The least we can do for our people is to speak on their behalf. We are in court permanently because the enemy agents have chosen the terrain of struggle. They have moved from the picket lines and brought the revolution into the courts. Because they know that at the picket lines they will not win against us and they want to use the money they have to suppress those they disagree with politically. Sanef can afford the money. George Soros got the money and he is feeding them.” Watch video below for more on the story:
