The Cape Town Weather office says a series of cold fronts are approaching the Western Cape this coming week. Forecaster, Matshidiso Mogale, says the first cold front is expected to make landfall on Monday morning with temperatures remaining in the low to mid-teens for the rest of the week. Mogale says although Tuesday is expected to be a dry day, the rest of the week will have rain. “Another cold front is expected for Wednesday morning, bringing some light rain, persisting for the entire day into Thursday. We’re expecting isolated to scattered showers. For Friday, there’s also a weak cold front that’s expected to pass through in the morning bringing some light rain for the south western parts, especially the Cape Metro and Cape Peninsula,” explains Mogale.
