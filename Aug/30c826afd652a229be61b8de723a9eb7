Scaling up service delivery and assessing the progress on the economic stimulus package and the implementation of the recovery plan are set to top the agenda of the President’s Coordinating Council meeting in Pretoria on Tuesday. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy David Mabuza will co-chair the first PCC meeting of the new administration at the Union Buildings later on Tuesday morning. The much anticipated gathering takes place at a time when the economy had contracted, the unemployment rate at almost 30% and with fears of another downgrade by the rating agencies. In response government wants to strengthen cooperative governance and implement a coordinated national programme of action to set the country back on a growth path. Tuesday’s meeting will focus on a new government model which seeks to improve the coherence and impact of service delivery and development in all three spheres of government.
