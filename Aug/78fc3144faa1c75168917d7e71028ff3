Tanzania has established a commission of inquiry into the deaths of 71 people after an oil tanker exploded in Morogoro region on Saturday. 59 people remain hospitalised and are receiving treatment as a result of injuries sustained from the fire. The explosion happened after people tried to take fuel from the tanker. Tanzanians are concluding a third day of mourning for those who perished in the deadly fire on Saturday. An oil tanker had overturned on Saturday morning and a big fire was ignited after people in the vicinity tried to take fuel from the tanker. The majority of those that died were buried on Sunday, but the tragedy has left many questions unanswered. Chief among these questions is whether the deaths could have been avoided in the first place. Tanzania’s Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa Majaliwa has established a commission of inquiry to probe the matter. The commission, whose composition is yet to be made public, is tasked with finding out if any authority is culpable in this matter. As a sign of the Prime Minister’s resolve to find the truth he has asked the commission not to hesitate to mention him if he is found to be blameworthy. The commission is to report back no later than Friday of this week with the findings. Many Tanzanians will be hoping that such a tragic incident doesn’t repeat itself in the future.
