Johannesburg Metro Police (JMPD) say an investigation will be launched to determine the cause of the crash that claimed ten lives on the N1 South near Midrand. It is believed the driver of a speeding minibus taxi lost control of the vehicle and it hit the concrete barrier. One passenger was ejected from the taxi and landed in the opposite north bound lane. The freeway has been re-opened in both directions. JMPD spokesperson, Xolani Fihla says: “Our accident unit from the JMPD has collected evidence and a case would be opened for culpable homicide and negligent and reckless driving and we would just find out what exactly happened to lead to this accident. I should think if the driver was driving at a safe speed even though he was at fault the accident could have been avoided.” ! Traffic Advisory !
