Eastern Cape Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga has commended police for arresting four suspects allegedly involved in the brutal murder of Toto Madikizela (78) in KwaNdengane village in Mbizana. It’s alleged that Madikizela was hacked to death after being accused of practicing witchcraft. Her homestead was also set alight and her children chased out of the village. Police spokesperson Khaya Tonjeni says, “General Ntshinga was very elated to discover that four suspects that were responsible for some attack and the killing of an elderly woman at KwaNdengane had been arrested…” “She also expressed her disapproval and condemned random and sporadic act of attacks and gruesome killings of women within the province especially within the women’s month,” adds Tonjeni. The Madikizela family has praised the police for their swift action. Family spokesperson Simbonile Madikizela says, “We are pinning our hope on the laws, that they will never get bail and they will get the harshest sentences ever. If it was according to me I would give them five life sentences so that they will never ever come back to the community because what they have done has been very traumatic, even to the community at large, because these murders have been going on for some time now.” The suspects are expected to appear in the Bizana Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
