The Chairperson of the Democratic Alliance’s Federal Legal Commission, Glynnis Breytenbach, says no decision has been taken to charge the party’s MP Phumzile van Damme. A weekend newspaper reported the party was considering taking disciplinary action against Van Damme for her alleged involvement in a punch up at Cape Town’s V&A Waterfront in June. Breytenbach says the matter is still under investigation. “The federal legal commission writes a report, sends it to FedEx with a recommendation and they will instruct us what to do. so whether ms Van Damme will be charged or not, I have no idea…and it is way premature to be talking about charges. We are talking about an investigation.” Watch video below for more:
