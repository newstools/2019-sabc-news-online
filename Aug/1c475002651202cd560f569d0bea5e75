The South African Private Practitioners Forum (SAPPF) says it does not support the current National Health Insurance (NHI) model. CEO, Chris Archer says they believe the proposed NHI model will cause irreparable harm to the South African healthcare industry, and will lead to the majority of South Africans having less access to comprehensive health services. He says more clarity is also needed from government on what the initiative might cost and how it will be funded in the current economic climate. Archer says government needs to consider alternative models of universal health coverage, which better reflect the practicalities and the South African environment.
