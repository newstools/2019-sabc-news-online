Police have arrested four suspects in connection with a killing spree in the Esigodini area outside Pietermaritzburg that claimed six lives at the weekend. Spokesperson for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Community Safety and Liaison Kwanele Ncalane says an armed group robbed and killed people at a tuck shop in the area. Family members of a taxi operator were also killed in a separate incident. Ncalane says it would seem the attackers are members of a gang who have just been released after being arrested on various charges. He says the police are looking for two more suspects. He says the police are working with various stakeholders in the area to ensure that they root out all criminals elements in this community. He says: “The fact that six people were killed in one night is an indication of a sick society and that is why we must join hands in making sure that we all collectively work hard to fight against the scourge of crime and illegal firearms to root out criminal elements in our society.”
