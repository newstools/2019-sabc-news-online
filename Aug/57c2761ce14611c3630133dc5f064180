Mafoko Security has distanced itself from any wrongdoing after the Special Investigating Unit(SIU) found evidence of serious irregularities in the SABC’s awarding of a tender to the firm two years ago. Former SABC Interim Board Members, who were involved in the procurement and awarding of the R185 million security tender could now face legal action. Mafoko Security Patrols’ Director-General Lebo Nare says the firm was not involved in the procurement processes by the public broadcaster. He says what is happening is unfortunate considering that they have seen the leaked report and it does not implicate the company in any wrongdoing. He says: “It is very unfortunate that we should be on the receiving end for something that we were not responsible for. We are not involved in the procurement processes of the SABC or clued up as to how they come up with the conclusion of the winning bidder.” “The process is an internal one at the SABC. We only received an appointment letter and we come and render quality security services at the SABC.” Related Video  DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6297045-SABC-R29-of-2017-and-R19-of-2018-Mafoko-Security.js", {  width: 600,    height: 800,    sidebar: false,    container: "#DV-viewer-6297045-SABC-R29-of-2017-and-R19-of-2018-Mafoko-Security"  });  <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6297045/SABC-R29-of-2017-and-R19-of-2018-Mafoko-Security.pdf">SABC R29 of 2017 and R19 of 2018 Mafoko Security Final Report 13062019 (PDF)</a><br />
