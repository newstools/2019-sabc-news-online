Disgruntled students of the EFF Student Command at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth have embarked on a mass shut down resulting in the university suspending lectures for the day. The students have barricaded the North and South campus entrances with branches and debris since the early hours of Monday morning. A statement released by the student command says students are demanding that university management intensifies safety and security on campus. University spokesperson, Zandile Mbabela says the institution is working with all stakeholders to ensure the safety of the university community. “While we do understand and we are aware of all the reported incidents of criminal activities and we are also mindfull that crime is a huge challenge not only for us but for Nelson Mandela Bay as a whole and as a country. Efforts to ensure the safety of our students and staff as a university are continuum, so we are doing the implementation of our safety and security strategy.” Click on the video below:
