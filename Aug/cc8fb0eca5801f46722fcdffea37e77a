The ANC Provincial Executive Committee has expressed disappointment at what they say is a leak of information to the media regarding the outcomes of its meeting. The PEC will on Tuesday announce the decision taken on the fate of embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede. However, some sources have told the SABC that the PEC has resolved to dismiss Gumede. On Thursday, the Durban Commercial Crimes Court amended Gumede’s bail conditions, allowing her to interact with the municipal manager and the chief financial officer. She faces fraud and corruption charges related to a R208-million solid waste tender. In last week’s meeting, no agreement was reached on the future of Gumede who the ANC has placed on a leave of absence for the past two months.
