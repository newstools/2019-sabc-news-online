Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani might be facing a fresh bid to remove him as the Democratic Alliance (DA), with the backing of the Congress of the People (COPE), the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), the Patriotic Alliance (PA) and six ANC councillors; have submitted a petition to the Speaker’s office urging her to hold a special meeting.  Mayor Bobani has survived several motion of no confidence votes, but opposition parties are adamant he won’t last long in his position. The DA, COPE, ACDP and PA councillor Marlon Daniels, who is a member of the current coalition government, have signed a petition to remove Bobani . This brought the number of signatures to a total 66 out of a council of 120. DA Provincial leader, Nqaba Bhanga, says the petition was also signed by some executive members of the mayoral committee. “We have submitted a petition to convene a special meeting. More than 61 councillors have signed it from different parties in the metro; including ANC councillors and members of Bobani’s executive people who are in the mayoral committee.” The petition also contained several signatures of ANC councillors in the metro, including Andile Lungisa. ANC RTT Co-ordinator, Luyolo Nqakaula, says the party will be meeting on Monday to discuss the matter. “As the ANC we are aware of the petition and we know councillors have signed it. As the ANC, we will be meeting to discuss the matter on Monday.”  Mayor Bobani says the councillors were tricked into signing the petition. “Those councillors called me and apologised saying; ‘Mayor, we were tricked to sign this petition to get you out’ and they went to get affidavits. I will still be there come the 23rd of August. They will not remove me. I am unshaken and unmoved.”  The AIC and EFF councillors in the metro did not sign the petition. A special council meeting is expected to take place this week.
