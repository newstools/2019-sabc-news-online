The National Freedom Party (NFP) has added to those who praised police for going back to the Johannesburg CBD to conduct counterfeit goods raids, after they were attacked and withdrew last week. The NFP’s Dlangezwa Mvelase says it is time to reclaim the City from people who disregard the law. “We urge the police to clean up the inner city, which is full of criminals. The City of Johannesburg together with the provincial government should come up with the programme to deal with these criminal activities that are occurring in our city. Our city has been captured by these foreigners. It is very sad. The way they behave is totally unacceptable and they do not do this in their countries.” Police say automatic rifles, shotguns and pistols are among the arms seized during the Johannesburg CBD counterfeit goods raid. About 1 500 officers were deployed for the raid. The police’s efforts to raid the area were thwarted last week when they were pelted with stones and other objects by a crowd. Police Minister Bheki Cele, together with Gauteng Premier David Makhura, visited the inner city where raids were being conducted. Cele says scores of undocumented foreign nationals have been arrested and dozens of items of counterfeit clothing and footwear were seized. “We have recovered guns. They will be taken for ballistic because the owner claims to be a legit security company who are competent. However, there are already some laws that have been broken. They are not keeping them in a safe and they are clearly illegal firearms and we will be processing them in terms of the law of the Republic of South Africa.”    Authors- Thabile Mbhele and Horisani Sithole
