KwaZulu-Natal premier, Sihle Zikalala, says issues of climate change should be included into the Education Curriculum to ensure that children are educated about the dangers of it at school level. The aim of the summit is to find lasting solutions to extreme weather conditions due to climate change. Zikalala was addressing delegates attending a two  day Climate Change Summit in Durban. ” We must mainstream climate change mitigation and adaptation in local government and ensure that our economic plans are adapted accordingly. We need to mainstream issues of climate change into education and training curriculum and ensure that is never the new normal, it should not be strange to deal with issues of climate change. Investing on research, investing on programs of climate change should not be seen as a less priority because we want to deal with only immediate issues.”
