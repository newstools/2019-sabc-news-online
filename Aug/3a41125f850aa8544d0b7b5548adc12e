Women are playing an increasing role in protecting the country’s national parks. Female rangers along the Garden Route are involved in dangerous operations such as helping to fight wildfires and abalone poaching in the region. It is a role previously dominated by their male counterparts. Senior section ranger for the Tsitsikamma National Park, Eugenia Mkhatshwa, says female rangers have worked hard to break gender stereotypes. “A ranger’s job is a ranger’s job. It doesn’t matter if you are male or female. Women rangers are doing the exact job like men. We are on the boat patrol, we are doing the coastal patrol on rocks, irrespective if you are are short, short-legged, fat…you can do whatever the man can do. The only thing is to put it up there in your mind that this is a job that I have to do. “
