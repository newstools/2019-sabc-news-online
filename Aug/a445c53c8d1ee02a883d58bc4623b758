Minister of Women, Youth and People with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane has urged women to equip themselves with ICT skills. Nkoana- Mashabane says acquiring ICT skills is important in preparing women for the jobs that the 4th Industrial Revolution will bring about. She was amongst government officials who attended the Department of Telecommunications ICT training certificates ceremony at the Vryburg Showgrounds in North West. More than 70 women have received digital skills training since Monday. Mashabane says this is an introductory programme and has encouraged the women to further their training. About 600 women across the country have benefited from the programme which is also in line with the Department of Communication’s 4IR programme. North West MEC for Public Works and Roads Oagile Molapisi, who attended on behalf of MEC for Social Development Boitumelo Moiloa, says the next step will be to build libraries. He has condemned the burning of buildings during protests. One of the recipients of the certificates Boitumelo Gadinabokao says the training has helped her understand the importance of technology. Another recipient Segametsi Dintwe has called for more similar programmes. “Youth here in Vryburg struggle with employment and drug abuse, so we need these kinds of programmes.” Meanwhile, preparations are underway for the Women’s Day celebrations happening in the area where President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver a key note address.
