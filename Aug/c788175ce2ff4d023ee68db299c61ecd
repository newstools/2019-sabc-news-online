Supporters of the recalled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede have accused the African National Congress (ANC) of persecuting her. This after KwaZulu-Natal ANC Provincial Executive Committee’s decision to recall her and the rest of the Durban metro’s executive committee, citing concerns about a lack of service delivery. Two months ago, the ANC ordered Gumede to take leave after being charged with corruption. Mzomuhle Dube, who has been organising support for Gumede explains why they think Gumede is being persecuted. “When you make a decision of recalling the Mayor or giving the mayor a leave of absence without clear terms of reference, in terms of what you are looking for and what you are investigating – similarly dissolves the structure where the Mayor is a chairperson of that structure and actually disregard any instruction that was given by the National Executive Committee. For us that is a reason enough, let alone some rumours that have been going around. Some leaders were actually confirming that they were gunning for the head of the mayor legally. So in terms of the cases that were actually created, we cannot move from that understanding to say the mayor has been persecuted,” explains Dube.   Watch related Gumede video:
