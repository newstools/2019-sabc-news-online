The Democratic Alliance (DA) Police Shadow minister, Andrew Whitfield, has called on the Police Minister, Bheki Cele, to urgently address the alleged shortage of rape kits in the country. Whitfield says 76 percent of police stations across the nation do not have adult rape kits and provinces have fewer rape kits than they require. He also alleges that 69 percent of stations do not have paediatric rape kits. In a statement, the party says the National Police Commissioner Kehla Sitole provided the details. Whitfield says the DA will give Cele 90 days in which to find solutions to the problem or face consequences. “We believe that the Minister needs to account and he needs to account to all the provinces in the country. We have police stations who are unable to fully execute their duties in the collection of evidence and that’s what we’re calling for. We’re giving the Minister ninety-days to ensure that this problem is rectified. It shouldn’t be that there are seventy-six police stations in the country with no rape kits whatsoever,” says Whitfield.
