ANC Women’s League President Bathabile Dlamini has urged the ruling party to be consistent and treat women and men equally. This comes in the wake of the recall of eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede following allegations of corruption. Speaking at the league’s dialogue with President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Umoyeni Conference Centre at Parktown in Johannesburg, Dlamini said men are not recalled when they face the same allegations. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa says his administration is determined to fix the major economic challenges that are currently facing the country. The President was addressing the dialogue. President Ramaphosa says government also plans to address the challenges that are crippling state owned enterprises. “We are going through a very challenging economic cycle at the moment that is also being made worse by our woes in Eskom and other state owned enterprises. What I can say comrades is that we will turn our economy around. We are going to turn it around whether people like it or not, we are going to do it because we have it within us to be able to focus more closely to what needs to be done. Watch this space.” Click video below:
