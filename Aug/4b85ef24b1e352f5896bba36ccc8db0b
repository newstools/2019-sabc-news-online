“KeepSafe Schools” is a new app designed to promote health and safety at schools in South Africa. The app is to assist schools in handling the little accidents and emergencies that children face on a daily basis. The app will not only educate little people on how to handle several emergencies, but also aid schools and the department of Education to see causes of absenteeism. The creator of the app, Dr Rufaro Nyamunda, recently won the “three month sabbatical medical practitioner” award, which will allow her to travel the country for 90 days sharing the app with various schools. Dr Rufaro says the app was created for safer school communities. “The idea behind it is to create safer school communities and schools to not feel helpless when they need the resources to aid with the accidents and emergencies they have with staff.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
