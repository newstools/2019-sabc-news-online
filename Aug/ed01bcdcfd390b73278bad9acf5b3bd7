The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has described the killing of its councillor Mthembeni Majola as a second and sadly successful assassination attempt. Majola was gunned down in Estcourt in the province’s midlands. Majola, who worked for the Nkosi Langalibalele Local Municipality, was travelling with two occupants in his car when they were attacked by gunmen. Majola is said to have died on the scene while the other two were rushed to hospital. IFP spokesperson, Mkhuleko Hlengwa says the party’s leadership has met with the Majola family. “An IFP councillor was killed yesterday in what is seemingly an assassination. It is clear that the target was Majola and of course we are expecting the law enforcement agencies to give us information. We think it’s prudent that we tread carefully on this matter given the sensitivity of political killings and politics in the province of KZN in general but the district of uThukela in particular. This was not the first attempt on the life of Majola as he was already in a wheelchair having previously been injured in another shooting some few years ago. So his life has been on the line.” WATCH BELOW:
