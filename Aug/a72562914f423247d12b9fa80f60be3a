A large number of schools in Bloemfontein have been without running water since last week. This is after the struggling Mangaung Metro began to take action against those who default in paying their rates and services. At least 92 primary and high schools owe the municipality more than R70 million in arrears. Mangaung Metro spokesperson, Qondile Khedama, says residents and government departments owe them R4 billion. “We have made arrangements two years back, some of them did not honour them. We have disconnected about 92 schools and 16 schools reacted immediately. They’ve either paid or made arrangements, so we hope that they will stick to the arrangement they’ve made with the municipality. The other thing that is critical is that total outstanding debts for water in the schools, it’s more than R75 million. So that tells you that there is a problem with our schools,” says Khedama.
