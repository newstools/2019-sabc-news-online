The Land Claims Court says former Land Affairs Minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, failed to comply with a court order to provide a redevelopment plan for District Six in Cape Town. High Court Judge, Jody Kollapen, ordered government last November to have the plan ready by February 2019. The Land Claims Court delivered its judgment on Friday morning. It says Nkoana-Mashabane was also grossly unreasonable in discharging her constitutional duties. The District Six Working Committee, representing over 1000 mostly elderly claimants, says they’ve waited for 20 years for restitution. Nkoana-Mashabane has been ordered to pay part of the costs of the case. Chairperson of the District Six Working Committee says, “Well not only has she failed the restitution process, she has failed in her constitutional obligations towards the people of South Africa and that is a big thing in this country. It shows that no Minister, no President, no Premier can hide behind the law anymore. It shows that democracy works in South Africa and the fact that she’s being held personally responsible for the cost goes along way”.
