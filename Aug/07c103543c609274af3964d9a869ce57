Former Tourism Minister and ANC NEC member, Derek Hanekom has confirmed that he is taking Former President Jacob Zuma to court for defamation, to the tune of R500 000. This is in relation to a tweet last month in which Zuma referred to Hanekom as a “known enemy agent”.  The tweet came after EFF leader Julius Malema alleged that Hanekom conspired with the party to oust Zuma through a motion of no confidence in the National Assembly. Hanekom says the matter will be heard in the Durban High Court next Wednesday. Click on the related video below:
