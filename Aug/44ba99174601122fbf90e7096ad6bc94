The retail price of petrol will increase by eleven cents per litre from Wednesday. The Central Energy Fund (CEF) says the weaker rand contributed to the price hike. Some good news however is that the illuminating paraffin price will drop by 2 cents, and diesel users are also set to experience some relief with the price expected to go down by between 13 and 14 cents a litre. Spokesperson for the AA, Layton Beard explains the price hike, “The real drivers behind these change is international petroleum prices which have remained relatively flat. Although we are seeing that they’re climbing at the moment, and a weakening rand-dollar exchange rate…” “When we look, however, at the numbers that are coming through for the rand-US Dollar exchange rate over the last couple of days, it’s something that we are going to have to monitor and it’s going to be interesting to see how that’s going to impact on the fuel price going forward,” adds Beard.
