The Democratic Alliance (DA) is demanding answers following the release of leaked e-mails which reveal individuals approached to fund President Cyril Ramaphosa’s African National Congress  (ANC) Presidential campaign. News24 says these e-mails appear to suggest that President Ramaphosa knew about the funding activities, contrary to his previous assertions that he was never told who funded his CR17 campaign. Last month Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that the President violated his executive ethics code by misleading parliament on a R500 000 donation by BOSASA. In her report, she also makes mention of the e-mails. She found the President had regular updates with his campaign managers. The President has taken Mkhwebane’s report on urgent review, insisting it is fundamentally flawed. “We were always of the view when we first laid the complaint with the Public Protector regarding that one problematic transaction, the 500 000, as to establishing the extent to which the President was actively involved.” says the DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi.
