Japanese companies would like South Africa to address security and education challenges before they make more investments in the country. This is according to Mariko Kaneko from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Her comments come as President Cyril Ramaphosa joins dozens of leaders in Yokohama for the Tokyo International Conference for African Development, also known as the TICAD Summit, on Wednesday. Ramaphosa is expected to use the summit to again punt South Africa as an investment destination. Kaneko says Japanese companies have some concerns. “There are some concerns about the security issues, but I think the government is trying to provide more of a secure environment for foreign companies. So, that is maybe one other request from Japanese companies. President Ramaphosa is focusing on education and training. I think this is another important area which South Africa can work on.” Related video click below:
