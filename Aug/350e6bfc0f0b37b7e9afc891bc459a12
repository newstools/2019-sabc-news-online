The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has failed to take a decision about the fate of eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede. The party held a provincial executive committee meeting to discuss the outcome of the report which looked at whether Gumede should continue as mayor or not. Gumede has been on leave for the past two months on instruction from the party. This follows her arrest on fraud and corruption charges linked to a waste removal tender. Gumede is out on a R50 000 bail. The party is expected to brief the media about the outcome of the PEC meeting on Tuesday. Watch video below for more on the story:
