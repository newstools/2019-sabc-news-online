The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department says a support plan that will facilitate a smooth transition from the outgoing Exco to the incoming, in both the embattled eThekwini and the uMsunduzi municipalities, is currently in place. Earlier this week, the African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal decided to recall all its eThekwini and uMsunduzi Executive Committee members including, Mayor Zandile Gumede and Mayor Themba Njilo. The party says its decision to recall its deployees was informed by poor performance of the affected municipalities. “As soon parties have concluded their processes, the department will work with the affected municipalities to reconstitute the council and facilitate the election of office bearers where necessary. We have commenced with a support plan for all affects municipalities. “Our main objective as Cogta is to support municipalities and ensure that there is an uninterrupted delivery of services and administrative stability in the Municipalities. As always our concern is the welfare of municipality residents,” says MEC Sipho Hlomuka. Watch video below for more on the story:
