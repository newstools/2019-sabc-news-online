A member of the Western Cape legislature Brett Herron has accused the City of Cape Town of blocking affordable inner city housing projects. Herron said the Western Cape Property Development Forum has confirmed that the local authority cancelled five affordable sites, with projects including an abandoned site in Pickwick Street, a parking lot in Newmarket Street and a site in Roeland Street. He said the sites would have added 4000 social housing rental units. This is also in the context of them having blocked the Salt River market site initially, and also having cancelled the foreshore freeway project which also included affordable housing. Herron said, “I think that we have a crisis in our city and a crisis of government and a crisis of leadership where our government and our leadership is not invested or concerned with a more equitable city and with addressing the group areas act which segregated people and put poor black people to the outskirts of the city.”
