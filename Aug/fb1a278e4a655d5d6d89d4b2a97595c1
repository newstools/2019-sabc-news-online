Twenty-seven municipal ward by-elections will be held in eight provinces on Wednesday. The by-elections will be contested by 105 candidates from 15 political parties and five independent candidates. The elections will take place in all provinces except in the Western Cape. Five of the by-elections will be held in Mpumalanga, they include wards in Mbombela, Emalahleni and in Msukaligwa. Mpumalanga IEC spokesperson Sibusiso Nkosi says the wards became vacant as a result of resignations and the death of the councillors. “In Mpumalanga we have a total of five by-elections, one in Msukaligwa, two Emalahleni and two in the City of Mbombela. In Msukaligwa we have by-elections in ward 12 and ward 15, Emalahleni also in ward 29.” “We have a by-election that will be contested by four candidates in the City of Mbombela ward 2…. Stations will be opened from seven o’clock and close at nine o’clock in the evening. We look forward to having a full participation by the communities.” In Limpopo, there will be a by-election in ward 4 at Mookgopong. This comes after the resignation of an ANC councillor who has been appointed as a member of the provincial legislature. Limpopo Electoral Officer Nkaro Mateta says four parties are contesting the by-election. “The ward councillor responsible for ward 4 in the area of Mookgopong resigned. She was given a position as a member of the provincial legislature in Limpopo province, so as a result a vacancy was declared. The four candidates contesting ward 4 are  from ACDP, ANC, EFF as well as Mookgopong party.” !function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");  Related video click below:
