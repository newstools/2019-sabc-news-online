The funeral of the late African Global Operations boss, Gavin Watson will be held in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday, September 4th. Sources close to the Watson family say the funeral will be open to the public at a venue yet to be disclosed. Watson died in a vehicle crash near the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Monday. It’s believed a memorial service will be held in Johannesburg on Friday. The businessman had received much praise for his support of the anti-apartheid forces during the struggle years. However, in recent years many questions were raised about bribes allegedly made by his company to ANC leaders. Meanwhile, the small town of Alicedale near Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape, is reeling with shock at Watson’s death. Alicedale resident, Thembisile Habhana says he was still young when the Watson family took him in. He says he’ll forever remember Watson as a kind man who never raised his voice. “Not even once have I ever seen him angry, despite being provoked as a farm owner. He would rectify something now, and not be talking about it the following day. He would tell you what you have done wrong and you’d also realise your mistakes.” Watch video below:
