The Department of Land Reform has intervened in an attempt to assist about 300 people who were evicted from the Klein Akker Farm in Kraaifontein last week. The families with their children were removed from the privately-owned land after the owner was granted a court order by the Cape Town High Court. It ruled that the community be removed to Phillipi more than 30 kilometres away from the farm. Residents decided instead to live along the road next to the farm. Deputy Land Reform Minister Mcebisi Skwatsha says the people will now be moved to a nearby farm belonging to the department as a temporary measure. “This is also in recognition and respect of the court processes undertaken. We are working together with other spheres of government. The Premier and a delegation which I was part of met to look further into the matter, making sure that there are basic human rights applied in this situation, including water and sanitation and proper shelter.” The City of Cape Town says it’s also willing to assist the evicted families. Mayor Dan Plato, however, says the community had earlier turned down the City’s relocation offer. Plato says they want to honour the ruling of the High Court, which compelled them to find an alternative accommodation for the evicted people. “We initially provided them two specific sites to relocate to – one in the Kraaifontein, Bloekomboss area; one in Phillipi. They refused both offers from the City of Cape Town. I note the call by the national Department of Land Reform.” For a related video, click below:
