Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says certain questions need to be asked around the independence of the judiciary in South Africa. However, she refused to corroborate Ekurhuleni Mayor, Mzwandile Masina’s views that the courts must not continue being the final arbiters of the law. Mkhwebane was speaking earlier on the side-lines of a stakeholder roadshow in Tembisa. “The critical point is there are issues that need to be dealt with there. When you are not happy with the performance of the judicial function by a judge, yes, there’s a Judicial Service Commission, but at what level or how long or to what extent, can the Judicial Service deal with the alleged issue of being corrupt, maybe by a judge and not applying the law, but just applying whatever narrative.”
