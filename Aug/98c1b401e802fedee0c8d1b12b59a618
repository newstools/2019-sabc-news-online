The Correctional Services Deputy Minister Phathekile Holomisa has called on communities to assist ex-female offenders to re-integrate into communities. He visited female offenders at the Nelspruit Correctional Centre, in Mpumalanga, as part of women’s month celebrations. “We appeal to our communities, community leaders, NGO’s, importantly business community to accept them, to give them the second chance so that as I say they become better citizens. “ Holomisa they should not be punished any further. “We can’t continue to punish them even when they are no longer inside the prison, just because of the mistakes that they made. Some of them have made mistakes of course others were deliberate on what they did, but they have been punished and therefore they all deserve to be given a second chance.”
