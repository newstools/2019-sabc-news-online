Police are searching for eight suspects who robbed a store and killed a security guard at Park Meadows Shopping Centre, east of Johannesburg. The suspects held the staff and customers at gunpoint before demanding cash and cellphones. A security guard who responded to the robbery was fatally wounded during a shootout. Police Spokesperson, Mavela Masondo says, “It is alleged that the suspects who were armed with pistols and rifles stormed into a shop that is selling electrical appliances and cellphones. Undisclosed amount of cash and several cellphones were taken from the shop.” Masondo says the suspects fled the scene using a number of getaway vehicles. “The suspects fled the scene in a white VW caddy, VW polo and silver grey Chevrolet Cruze. Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects and are appealing to anyone who might have information to please call the nearest police station or crime stop.”
