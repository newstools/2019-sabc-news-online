The South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) in the Northern Cape has called on the Sol Plaatje Municipal Council to table a damning investigative report into the affairs of the municipality or face industrial action. The section 106 report released last year found that the municipal CFO Lydia Mahloko regularly flouted procurement processes and that municipal manager Goolam Akharawary improperly benefited from a scarce skills allowance. Then Mayor Mangaliso Matika was also cited as not acting decisively when allegations of impropriety first surfaced against the CFO and municipal manager. Both have been on paid suspension since last year. The tabling of the report would allow the municipality to take disciplinary action against both officials. SAMWU regional official Dailey Semau says the 106 report is causing instability in the municipality. “This 106 report is causing instability in our municipality. Forever it doesn’t sit. It’s now more than a year people are on suspension, they have not been charged and it’s quiet about the report. So we as SAMWU are saying we want this report to be tabled for stability and to save the municipality lots of money in terms of the acting that we are paying,” says Semau.
