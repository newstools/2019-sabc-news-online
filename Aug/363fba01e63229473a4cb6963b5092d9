Political analyst, Zakhele Ndlovu, says the new leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party will face various challenges, including growing the party into one that is popular among provinces other than KwaZulu-Natal. The party’s former secretary-general, Velenkosini Hlabisa, has taken over from Mangosuthu Buthelezi – who has stepped down after being at the helm of the IFP for 44-years. The IFP currently maintains most of its popularity in KZN. Ndlovu says Hlabisa will need to adopt the charismatic leadership methods used by Buthelezi… “I think the major challenge that is going to be facing the new leader is to try and take the IFP to another level and make it a party that is not just big in KZN but also as a footprint in other provinces and make it more of a national party. I think the new leader has big shoes to fill. Buthelezi is a very charismatic leader so it will be very interesting to see how the new leader will be viewed by the majority of the IFP supporters and those wanting to join the party.”  Click on the video below:
