Eskom has confirmed it has started to sell large quantities of electricity to Zimbabwe again, fully reinstating a power export arrangement it had curtailed after the country failed to pay its debts. The power utility says its decision has eased a protracted power crisis characterised by daily outages lasting up to 18 hours in Zimbabwe. The spokesperson of Zimbabwe’s state-owned Zesa Holdings, Fullard Gwasira, says they expect less electricity demand. He says they are currently receiving 400 megawatts from Eskom and most of Zimbabwe’s power stations are also running. Zimbabwe owes Eskom $23-million in unpaid bills and its Treasury has committed to weekly payments of $890 000  to clear the debt.
