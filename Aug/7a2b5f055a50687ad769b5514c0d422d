The Constitutional Court will on Tuesday hold a special sitting in honour of Justice Edwin Cameron who will step down from the apex court, 25 years after his appointment as a judge. Cameron began serving the Constitutional Court in January 2009. For decades, he has been championing the rights of gay and lesbian people as well as fighting denialism and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS. Cameron, who is openly gay, was one of the first public figures to disclose his HIV status. Advocate Jeremy Gauntlett, one of his friends, says:. “He has left behind this enormous body of work, something like 400 judgments overall in which he has participated. Someone like Judge Cameron has been an exceptional legal scholar, an accomplished legal writer and a judge.”
