KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, says the provincial government will continue to fight alongside women for equal pay and to bring an end to their discrimination in the workplace.
Zikalala addressed thousands who attended the official provincial Women’s Day commemoration held in Osizweni, Newcastle.  Meanwhile,  in Tshwane, residents have taken part in 2 kilometre memorial walk from the Lillian Ngoyi Square to the Union Buildings. This is the same route followed by the extraordinary women activists of 1956, who fought an unjust apartheid system. In commemoration of Women’s Day, they highlighted their own struggles including gender-based violence and economic deprivation.  In Limpopo, the provincial women’s day celebration was held at the Makhuvha stadium in the Vhembe district.  The province has a very high rate of women abuse.
