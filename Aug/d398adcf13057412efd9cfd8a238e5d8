The African National Congress (ANC) caucus in the City of Cape Town says it is concerned about alleged irregular expenditure amounting to more than R100 million. Chief Whip, Thandi Makhasi says the City’s intention to write off the expenditure amounts to corruption. Makhasi says they will report the matter to the Office of the Public Protector. “We did warn them in fact on the issue of the BYD buses, which now has to pay back over millions to the City of Cape Town and that case is already with the Public Protector. We are still going back and ask them to investigate and also go to the national sphere of government to also assist in this, including Salga as we have said it.” City of Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato says there is nothing new about the ANC claims. Plato says the City has received an unqualified report from the Auditor General for clean governance. “Under the Democratic Alliance, the City of Cape Town has a history of clean governance and a zero-tolerance approach to corruption. Where wrongdoing is found we take the appropriate action. The Auditor General gave the City of Cape Town an unqualified audit, something that municipalities run by the ANC are unable to achieve,” says Plato’s spokesperson, Lyndon Khan.
