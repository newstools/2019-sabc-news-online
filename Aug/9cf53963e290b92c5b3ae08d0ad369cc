The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) is to investigate the alleged involvement of a police officer in the death of South African female boxing champion, Leighandre ‘Baby Lee’ Jegels, who was shot and killed near Mdantsane, in East London. The 25 -year-old was allegedly killed by her boyfriend – a member of the police’s Tactical Response Team (TRT). The victim’s mother was admitted to hospital after she was also shot and injured in Friday’s incident which involved a high speed car chase. IPID spokesperson, Sontaga Seisa, says the suspect has been arrested and will appear in court on Monday. “An off duty TRT police official based in Eastern Cape shot and killed his girlfriend, and injured his girlfriend’s mother. Immediately after the shooting the police official drove off leaving the scene.” “He was later arrested and is currently in hospital due to some injuries that he sustained because of a motor vehicle accident. He will be appearing in court on Monday.”
