eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede is due back in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday. She is due to appear together with eThekwini councillor Mondli Mthembu and businessman Craig Poonan. They are facing charges of fraud and corruption in connection with a R208 million tender for refuse removal. Several other business people are also facing prosecution in connection with the same tender. The African National Congress (ANC) is still deliberating on Gumede’s political fate. She has been absent from her office for almost two months after she was instructed by the ANC to take leave because of the charges. The ruling party’s provincial leadership is said to be divided on what action they should take. They decided to defer the matter to a special meeting scheduled for this weekend.
