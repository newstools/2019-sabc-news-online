The man accused of murdering his girlfriend and burying her body in a shallow grave inside his shack in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, will be back in court on Tuesday for a formal bail application. Twenty-eight year-old Thokozani Sibeko made his first appearance in the Protea Magistrateâ€™s Court in Soweto earlier this month, on charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Police found the body of his 41-year-old girlfriend two months after she had disappeared. While drinking alcohol with his friends at a local shebeen in Vlakfontein, Sibeko allegedly confessed that he had killed his 41-year-old girlfriend and buried her body under his bed. When he appeared in court earlier this month, Sibeko initially declined to be represented by a state lawyer, saying he knew the story of what happened better, and therefore would like to represent himself. He changed his mind after the magistrate said it would be impossible for him to apply for bail without a lawyer. Sibeko has a previous six months conviction for assault with an intention to do grievous bodily harm. WATCH BELOW:
