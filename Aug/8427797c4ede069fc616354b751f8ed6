The women’s hostel, ‘Huis ten Bosch’, at Stellenbosch University is on fire. University spokesperson Martin Viljoen says their first priority is to ensure the safety of the students and to find them alternative accommodation. The hostel houses 164 students. Students are being offered counseling. The university says it appears that all students have been evacuated. It’s not clear what caused the blaze and whether anyone was hurt.
