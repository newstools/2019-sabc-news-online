Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has revealed a letter that he claims says the African National Congress (ANC) received R3 million from controversial company Bosasa in 2014 when Cyril Ramaphosa was Deputy President of the ANC. Maimane revealed this during the President’s Q-and-A session in the National Assembly. Ramaphosa says he knows of no other monies given to the party from Bosasa other than the R500 000 paid to his son, Andile, that was later found to have been donated to his CR17 campaign. Maimane asked the President if he was willing to commit the ANC to returning all the monies received from Bosasa. Meanwhile, Parliamentarians have questioned President Ramaphosa about what is being done about the VBS Bank corruption scandal one year later. Almost R2 billion was stolen by the bank’s directors, senior executives and well-connected politicians. To date, nobody has been brought to book. Ramaphosa says the NPA is working on the matter. “It cannot be the president … it cannot be the deputy president … it cannot be the cabinet. It must be the prosecuting authority that takes that decision. So, honourable iMaam, I hear you and I know that there’s a great deal of impatience across the nation because they want to see justice being done and indeed justice will be done,” says Ramaphosa.
