The Small Business Development Minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, will be in the Johannesburg CBD on Monday following concerns that there are loads of counterfeit goods in the area. She will speak to hawkers and informal traders. Last week, when Metro police attempted to crackdown on those who sell counterfeit goods in the area, they were met by a huge number of suspected foreign traders who threw stones, rocks and petrol bombs at them. The volatile situation forced the officers to retreat. Ntshavheni’s spokesperson, Priscilla Monama, says the minister is concerned about criminality in the Johannesburg CBD. “We can’t allow criminal elements to hold the city and citizens to ransom. The lawlessness and criminal activities that were seen last week should be condemned and we really want to commend our police officers and the manner in which they retreated and avoided a potential blood bath particularly as it relates to citizens.” Watch a related video below:  Mini
