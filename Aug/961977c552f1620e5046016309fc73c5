The community of Engolotshe at KwaNongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal whose livestock are being killed by lions and other predators, allegedly escaping from the Imfolozi Game Reserve, has turned to AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to intervene on their behalf. The community claims the electric fence of the reserve is not working and fence poles are lying on the ground. They say they have written to relevant departments including Ezemvelo Wildlife to keep the lions away from their homes, but nothing has changed. Community member Siphiwe Mbatha says, “In April this year my 10 goats disappeared and we as community members went to search for them at the forest. We found all of them dead on top of the tree. The lion dragged them up to the tree. It is disappointing as we have been reporting this matter for many years ago.”
