The SABC has launched its first lactation station for nursing mothers at its headquarters in Auckland Park, Johannesburg. As part of its effort to become breastfeeding friendly, the public broadcaster will roll out the initiative in all its other regions country-wide. The SABC will enable nursing mothers to express breast milk privately when they return from maternity leave. Mothers in the workplace have always complained that it’s not hygienic to pump alongside the general public and in bathrooms. SABC’s Nomusa Kweyama says: “We thought this year let us focus on what moms requires when they return from maternity leave and we thought this would be an appropriate time to actually make sure that we provide private space for our moms at SABC and to make sure that they continue to be at work.” “As a result we know that when we do this to our mothers at SABC we also are assisting the employer which is our company to ensure that we have a productive workforce all the time.” Related video click below:
