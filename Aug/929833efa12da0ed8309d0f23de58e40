Department of International Relations and Cooperation says it is helping with the repatriation of the bodies of pilots Des Werner and Werner Froneman from Tanzania. The light plane of the two pilots crashed in the east African country on Sunday. They had been flying the plane as a support team for teenagers who made the historic flight in their own self-built plane from Cape to Cairo. Werner and Froneman were returning to South Africa after the successful flight to Cairo when their light aircraft experienced problems in Tanzania. The department’s spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele says they have also been providing support to the families of the pilots. “Generally as the Department of International Relations we offer assistance to make sure the family gets to the loved ones who are in distress outside the country or if it is a situation like that in Tanzania where people are dead we will make sure the family get all the papers and make sure the bodies are brought back for burial.”
