The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) is investigating the death of Tshegofatso Selahle who died after being arrested by metro police in Johannesburg. The City of Johannesburg says its own internal investigation is also underway. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) claims that Selahle was resisting arrest because he was drunk. It is alleged that Selahle informed officers that he was struggling to breathe after being put inside a JMPD van. An ambulance was called but Selahle died before its arrival. IPID Spokesperson, Sontaga Sisa says they are looking into the matter. “We are currently in the process of investigating and getting statements from witnesses and eye witnesses. As we speak now, we cannot say exactly what the cause of death is, but there are allegations that the police might have had a hand in either contributing to the death of the deceased. Nobody has been arrested and we are carrying on with investigations.”
