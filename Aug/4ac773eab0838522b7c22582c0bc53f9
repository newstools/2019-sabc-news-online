President Cyril Ramaphosa says new measures government is implementing will stimulate the country’s stricken economy. Delivering the keynote address at the National Women’s Day celebrations in Vryburg, North West, on Friday, Ramaphosa said they are implementing revitalised industrial strategy in support of key growth sectors. He insists that his administration is doing all it could to revive the strained economy, while jobs are continuously being shed in the private sector. “Our economy has not been growing, and public finances are severely constrained. Yet while our economy is in crisis, we are no means powerless. Working together with business and labour in communities and across civil society we are taking measures to restore our economy and create economic opportunities.,” says Ramaphosa.  He adds that “According to the figures released last week by Statistics South Africa, the expanded unemployment rate among women stands at 42.5%, while it stands at 35% among men.”
