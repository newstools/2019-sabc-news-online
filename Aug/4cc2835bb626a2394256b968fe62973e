The Gauteng Premier, David Makhura will have to drop one male MEC in his provincial executive. However, the question is who will be the casualty in Makhura’s move? The African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League has always been vocal about gender parity in the party and all government structures. Now, the matter has been escalated to the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) and Makhura will have to adhere to the requirements. However, the ANC in Gauteng says the issue of deployment is an internal matter and it will inform the public at a later date. At its previous NEC meeting, the ANC’s highest decision-making body deliberated on the structure of the Gauteng cabinet. The ANC Women’s League president, Bathabile Dlamini had raised concerns over the lack of female representation in the province. It would seem this has now received resonance in the party. Last week, ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte told a media briefing that this will be addressed in due course.
