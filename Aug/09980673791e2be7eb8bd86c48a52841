The parents of a man who died at Kranskop in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands almost a year ago have demanded that police release the body for burial. They’ve waited almost a year for DNA results on a decomposed body which they claim were that of their missing son Celempilo Ndlovu. The Ndlovu family say their 30-year-old son went missing in September 2018. He worked in Johannesburg and went missing while travelling home to attend a funeral. A body of a male was found in bushes on a farm near Greytown. The family says they identified Celempilo by his clothes. But police could not release the body to them without DNA tests. They’ve now waited for 11 months and blame the police for dragging their heels. Celempilo’s mother Hlekani Ndlovu says:”His brother went to the lab in Pretoria after we were not given DNA results and he found that our samples were not there. When we notified police they said it was not true.” “But after some time other officials came to take samples for DNA testing. They collected them in April, even today we are still waiting. They must just release my son’s body because it’s him I know.” Celempilo’s father Nkosenjani Ndlovu says:”We can hold a funeral for my son, It has been a year now, they are sending us from pillar to post.” The family say they can’t continue with their lives while they are mourning. Celempilo’s brother Xolani Ndlovu says:”It’s sad because we can’t continue with our lives because we are still in mourning.” Efforts to get comment from the police drew a blank. WATCH BELOW:
