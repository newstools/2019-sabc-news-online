The remains of seven of the eight victims who were burnt beyond recognition during a horrific accident on the N11 near Middleburg in Mpumalanga have been handed over to their families. This after DNA tests had been completed. The eight victims were killed during a head on collision between a heavy vehicle and minibus last month. Community Safety MEC Gabisile Tshabalala says only one family have not received their sample because the family is from outside the country. “Only one that did not yet receive the sample, obviously because they from outside the country from Mozambique. So we are waiting because we do that process through relatives. We need a family member who is going to volunteer that they are going to take the sample. So we had that challenge, so I want to believe that we will have a progress because we are waiting for the relative to come forward so that we do the process,” says Tshabalala.
