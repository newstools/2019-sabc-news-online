South African Communist Party (SACP) General Secretary Blade Nzimande says they reject the notion that the economy has been suffering since President Cyril Ramaphosa took the reigns. He says the economy is suffering because of the billions of rand stolen through state capture. Nzimande was speaking in Ermelo in Mpumalanga at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the party in South Africa. He’s also urged workers to unite against the current retrenchments taking place in the country. Nzimande also called on the financial sector to end what he calls its investment strike. This comes as President Ramaphosa continues his investment drive in a bid to start growing the economy and creating desperately needed jobs. He says the financial sector must remember that the source of its funds is ordinary South Africans. “That’s why, amongst other things, we supported the campaign of the President to mobilise domestic and foreign investment. We also call upon the financial sector to end its investment strike. It’s very interesting, by the way, that this money in the financial sector is our money. We take our monies from stokvels to insurance companies. We don’t want those monies to be wasted, but they must be invested.”
