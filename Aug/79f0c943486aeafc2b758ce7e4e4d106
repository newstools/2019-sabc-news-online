A Military court proceeding against a Major in the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) has been postponed until November. Major Fatima Isaacs faces two charges of wilful defiance and disobeying lawful demand for refusing to remove her headscarf. In a brief appearance in the Military Court in Cape Town at the Castle of Goodhope it was heard that a new council will be representing Isaacs in her fight to practice her freedom of religion by wearing a headscarf which is a requirement for Muslim woman. Isaacs has been serving the SANDF for the past decade. She currently works as a clinical forensic pathologist at 2 Military Hospital in Wynberg. SANDF spokesperson Mafi Mgobozi says following a meeting with the Muslim Judicial Council and the Chief of the SANDF a decision for interim relief has been taken but he could not elaborate further. The matter has been postponed until the 6th and 7th of November.
