Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) Members of Parliament Tebogo Mokwele and Nkakisang Mokgosi have resigned from the National Assembly and the leadership of the party. The two took to Social Media on Monday to communicate their decision taken after it was revealed that they received money-from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s CR17 account. In identical tweets the two admit to having received R 80 000 from Ramaphosa between 2017 and 2019 for their personal use.  Speaking to SABC News,  Mokwele says, “I resigned because of the code of conduct of my organisation. I resigned because I don’t want to drag my organisation into disrepute. I don’t want my organisation to go around instead of them serving the people of South Africa, go around your media house to explain personal things. I did it because I wanted to do it, it’s not because somebody forced me to do it.” Mokwele has insisted that she has no relations with Ramaphosa. “Me and the President of the country we don’t have anything personal, we don’t have any relationship. By that time he was the deputy president, this time he’s the President of the country, other than that there’s nothing between us. So I’m not obliged to give favours in return for the services that he assisted me with.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
