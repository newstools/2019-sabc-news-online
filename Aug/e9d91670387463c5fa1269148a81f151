KwaZulu-Natal is holding its first climate change summit following floods in which 70 people were killed in April. The two-day summit is aimed at finding a lasting solution to extreme weather conditions related to climate change.  The April floods left a trail of destruction, damaging houses, roads, power networks, schools and health facilities. In 2017, more than ten people were killed in the province due to severe weather conditions that included strong winds, hail and heavy rain in Nquthu and Durban. KwaZulu-natal Premier Sihle Zikalala is delivering the keynote address. Delegates are expected to craft a programme to respond to the increasing threat of severe weather conditions.
