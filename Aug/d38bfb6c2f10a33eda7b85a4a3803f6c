The trial of truck driver Colin Pillay accused of killing his girlfriend and her two daughters continues in  the Durban High Court on Wednesday. The court is expected to hear a detailed analysis of social media messages between Pillay and his late lover. Pillay had pleaded not guilty to the murders of Jane Govindasamy and her daughters, Denisha and Rackelle. He has also been charged with the theft of a cellphone and money. On Tuesday, the State led evidence from Warrant Officer Pravin Sukdeo who is assisting with investigations. Sukdeo informed the court that Pillay arrived at the crime scene, pleading with police to arrest the person responsible for killing his lover and his two step-daughters. Sukdeo says he noticed visible scratch marks on Pillay’s face and injuries to his hands. Both Pillay and the deceased’s husband’s clothes were confiscated by police for DNA samples. The court heard that the blood stains on Pillay’s clothes matched that of youngest victim, 16-year-old Rackelle.
