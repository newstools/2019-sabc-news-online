The police together with the army have arrested 150 wanted suspects over the past few days on the Cape Flats, for a range of crimes including rape and murder as part of Operation Lockdown. Members of the South African National Defence Force were deployed to the Western Cape a month ago, following a plea for intervention from communities about serious and violent crimes plaguing the Cape Flats and other townships in the Cape Metropole.  Police spokesperson, Novela Potelwa, says members of the Anti-Gang Unit also executed searches at the Brandvlei Prison where they seized cell-phones and drugs. “Detectives went about on tracing operations that netted 151 suspects. The suspects were wanted for theft, armed robbery, rape, murder and attempted murder. Meanwhile, in other operations and raids, 299 arrests were effected for a variety of crimes and also seizures in the form of drugs, firearms, ammunition, knives and large quantities of alcohol.”
