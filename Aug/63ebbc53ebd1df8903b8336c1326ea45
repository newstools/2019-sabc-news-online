At least twelve houses have now been destroyed by a fire in Saint Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape. Many of the houses in the area have thatched roofs. The blaze started in adjacent veld. A back-up team and helicopter from Port Elizabeth has been deployed to help douse the flames. No deaths or injuries have yet been reported. Kouga Spokesperson said a total of 12 homes have been affected but the number continues to rise. “St Francis Bay is a very very close-knit community and communities are coming together. People are wearing masks … young kids are wearing masks just taking a hosepipe and trying to do what they can to fight the fire.” Earlier, a helicopter from Port Elizabeth was dispatched to assist in dousing the fires. However the helicopter will not be able to fly after sunset. Four fire trucks from Port Elizabeth have also raced to the area to assist local fire fighters. See tweet below:
