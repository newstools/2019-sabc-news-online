Former National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete says she believes that South Africa is not ready for a female President. Her comments come as the country marks National Women’s Day on Friday. Speaking exclusively to SAfm, Mbete says women have proven to be great leaders and are ready to lead the country.  However, she says most South Africans do not show support for female leadership. “I think there are lots of women who are ready, who are great, who are even better qualitatively than many male leaders. But SA is extremely unready. SA believes women are not the type of people who must be leaders and yet, they see them doing great things but they choose to believe otherwise.”
