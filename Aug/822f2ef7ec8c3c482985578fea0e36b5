The Cape Town Shutdown Movement has urged the Western Cape provincial government to make available spaces of land for people to build houses. The movement has shut down major roads leading in and around Cape Town on Thursday morning, hoping to highlight a number of issues, including the shortage of affordable housing opportunities for Coloured people. They have also voiced frustration over what they say is the continued manipulation of housing lists. Gatvol Capetonian Movement’s Fadiel Adams says they are willing to build their own houses. “It has started, Delft has started, Kensington has started. Also, SAPS are intimidating people – like in Parkwood. We are aware of the fact that government can’t give us houses, they don’t have the money – what we are saying to them is there is lots of open space. Service the plot, give the man his land, we will build our own houses and we will be fine. We have young people coming in and they are being housed. We want houses and to be respected. With disabled people, whatever their colour, should be accommodated.”
