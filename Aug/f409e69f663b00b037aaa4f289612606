The African National Congress (ANC) leadership in KwaZulu-Natal has pledged its full support for President Cyril Ramaphosa amid his on-going legal battle with Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) says it is concerned about what it says is a sustained public effort to ruin the president’s reputation. KwaZulu-Natal has been seen as a stronghold of former president Jacob Zuma. The party’s Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says Ramaphosa has the full support of all party structures in the province. “On the support for President Cyril Ramaphosa, the PEC is deeply concerned about what appears to be a sustained public assault on the name and reputation of the president which to a large extent is intended and ultimately is directed to weakening the organisation as a whole. The PEC is unanimous in its firm view that the ANC president must find solace on the support from all structures and members of the ANC in KZN during these trying times.” Watch the video below for related news:
