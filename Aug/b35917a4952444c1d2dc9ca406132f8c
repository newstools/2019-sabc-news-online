Judgment will be delivered in the High Court in Cape Town on Thursday in the bail application of convicted murderer Jason Rohde. He is serving 20 years behind bars for the murder of his wife, Susan, who was found dead in a bathroom at Spier Wine Farm near Stellenbosch three years ago. Last month, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein granted Rohde leave to appeal. Rohdeâ€™s defence team lodged an urgent bail application pending the appeal case on grounds that another court may come to a different conclusion. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe, who sentenced Rohde in February, will deliver judgment. Watch the video below for related news:
