Information about donors to the CR17 campaign, which is contained in leaked emails, points to a need in a democracy for the opening up of party funding. This is according to political analyst Ongama Mtimka. “It’s unfortunate that President Cyril Ramaphosa is the one now who is accounting, as opposed to everybody else who was running campaigns.” Click below for full interview:  News24 has published several e-mails and the names of the people who President Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign managers approached to fund his CR17 ANC presidential campaign. The publication says these e-mails have been verified. The e-mails appear to suggest that Ramaphosa had knowledge of the activities of his funding campaign, contrary to his previous assertions that he had been kept at arm’s length on who funded his campaign. In July the Public Protector found that the President violated his executive ethics code by misleading parliament on his R500 000 donation by Bosasa. In her report, Busisiwe Mkhwebane also makes mention of the e-mails. She found the President had regular updates with his campaign managers. The leaked e-mails by News24 seem to confirm this. It says the e-mail in its possession show that the President was consulted by his campaign managers about plans to approach several donors. The Presidency and the CR17 campaign manager were not immediately available for comment.
