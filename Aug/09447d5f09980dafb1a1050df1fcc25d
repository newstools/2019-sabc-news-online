The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the judgment by the Equality Court which ruled that the display of the old South African flag was hate speech.  The matter was brought by the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The court ruled that display of the apartheid-era flag amounted to hate speech and unfair discrimination against black South Africans. However, the lobby group, AfriForum, challenged the move, saying it will violate freedom of speech. Deputy Judge President Phineas Mojapelo handed down the judgment. “It is, in fact, hurtful, harmful, promotes and propagates hatred towards black people. It demonstrates a clear intention to be hurtful, to be harmful and incites harm and it, in fact, promotes and propagates hatred against black people in contravention of Section 10.1 of the Equality Act. It constitutes hate speech.” Judge Mojapelo says the flag is a symbol of racial oppression. Watch video below for more on the story:
