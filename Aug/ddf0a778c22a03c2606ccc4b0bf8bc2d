The Small Business Development Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni has reacted to reports that she allegedly misappropriated funds for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign for the African National Congress (ANC) presidency. She says the weekend reports are based on malice and are devoid of any truth. Ntshavheni says it’s common knowledge that people like her and other co-ordinators meet with branch party members who need funding for things such as air time, petrol and food. “People now are not invited by paper. They are invited by WhatsApp and follow-up phone calls and they’ve got to have airtime and data to be able to do that so that was what the money was spent on; but secondly, our branches of the ANC are ward-based and our wards are very vast you can find that in one ward there are three or four villages in the case of Limpopo. People then had to be moved from one village to the venue of the meeting and somebody had to pay for petrol.” Related developments On Sunday, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) confirmed that its MP Tebogo Mokwele did receive money from the CR17 campaign account. Mokwele confessed that she received a total of R40 000, saying that Ramaphosa assisted with a bereavement she had in her family.  The EFF says Mokwele told the party leadership about the money and that it related to a personal problem. The EFF claims the admission confirms that the president was directly involved in the CR17 account. Mokwele on Monday issued a statement resigning from all leadership positions in the party, and as a Member of Parliament.  Meanwhile the South African Communist Party (SACP) General-Secretary, Dr Blade Nzimande says they remain steadfast behind President Cyril Ramaphosa’s leadership even as more revelations are coming out regarding the CR17 campaign monies. Nzimande says there is nothing wrong with what Ramaphosa has done. Click below for more:
