African National Congress (ANC) veteran Ben Turok says the party’s Western Cape region is still suffering from factional battles. He argues that this continues to render its structures in the province dysfunctional. Turok was reacting to the disbandment of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) by the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC). Turok says the party has the capacity to recover from these factional set-backs. The Western Cape is run by the Democratic Alliance. The NEC has resolved to send its deployees to the province, to set-up proper structures before the 2021 local government election. Ben Turok says: “The main problem of the ANC in the Western Cape is that over the years it did not become a mass movement, did not root itself properly.” An interim provincial committee will be established to implement the process of renewal and rebuilding of party structures. Analysts say this might, however, be too little too late. Political analyst Keith Gottchalk says:”They will have to work hard and fast to get a working and dynamic provincial leadership, before the 2021 electioneering is on us.” To add to its political woes, alliance partner, the SACP is calling for an investigation into the misuse of election funds, and an immediate suspension of those implicated.
