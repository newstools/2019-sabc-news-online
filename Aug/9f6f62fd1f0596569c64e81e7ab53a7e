The City of Johannesburg is going ahead with plans to rebuild demolished structures in Alexandra, north of the city. A few months ago the Red Ants descended on illegal structures in the township and displaced some families. At the time Mayor Herman Mashaba promised to rebuild the demolished houses.  Mashaba says the City’s red tape has delayed his response. “I run and I operate in a regulated environment so we are doing a study, quantity surveyors and our legal people to look at options. They will be presenting to us very shortly and we will announce what action to take, that demolition was done by the ANC to destabalise my administration like they did with the Alexandra renewal project.”
