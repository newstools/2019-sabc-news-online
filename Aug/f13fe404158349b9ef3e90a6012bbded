KwaZulu-Natal Arts and Culture MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela have urged road users to exercise caution on the roads. She was speaking at the funeral service of one of the six maidens, Nonjabulo Jabu Dludla, who perished last weekend, when the vehicle they were traveling in crashed and caught alight. The young women were attending an event in the lead-up to the annual reed dance. It was a sombre mood at the funeral service of 18 year-old Dludla. Friends, family and community members are still in shock following her untimely death. Dludla was one of the six maidens who died in a fatal crash last weekend. Her father Khethonjani Dludla says he is heartbroken. “I am very sad and heartbroken about the passing of my daughter. She was everything to me. I expected a lot from her, I had big dreams.” Dludla was a matriculant at Dundee Secondary School. Her fellow classmates described her as a humble soul who loved laughter. “I’ve known her for a short time and all I know is that she was an amazing person. She was a joy to have around, good listener and loved school.” The Provincial MEC for Arts and Culture has promised to work with the family to help them get through this difficult time. She says stringent measures have been put in place to help reduce these fatal crashes as the department prepares for the main event in September. “I just want to send my deepest condolences to the families. The department will assist all affected families. I would also like to encourage other maidens not to be afraid to attend the Reed Dance.” As the department working with the  Transport Department and the Zulu Royal house, we have programmes in place to ensure safety on our roads, especially during this time.” Three of the six girls have now been laid to rest. The three remaining bodies were burnt beyond recognition and the families are awaiting DNA results.
