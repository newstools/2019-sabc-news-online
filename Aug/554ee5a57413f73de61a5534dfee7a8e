Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi will visit Thuto-Lesedi Secondary School in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg, today following allegations of rape. Two grade 12 boys are alleged to have sexually violated a grade 9 learner in the school’s toilets. The incident is said to have taken place during the break on July 25, 2019. The boys have since been suspended and their disciplinary hearing has been scheduled for today. “This is quite a serious offence if one were to be found guilty. The SGB (School Governing Body) will then have to recommend. If they feel that the learners must be expelled then that recommendation must still go to the Head of the Department who will then assess on the information or the case at hand and decide,” says Gauteng Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona.
