President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Tanzania for a state visit and to attend a Southern African Development Community’s (SADC) heads of state summit. The summit’s theme is centred around industrialisation as the overarching priority for the region. He will also hold talks with his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli in Dar es Salaam on Thursday morning. International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor says SADC’s economic challenges, peace and security issues will be placed high on the agenda of the summit. The crucial meeting will also consider the finances of the region. Pandor says Wednesday’s Council of Ministers looked at regional integration ahead of the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area. She says, “On financial matters there are areas where we have expressed concern; the secretariat is busy looking at its organisational structure to ensure efficient expenditure of the budget. We also welcomed the agreement and ratification of the Free Trade Area which we think goes very well at the region.” Related video below
