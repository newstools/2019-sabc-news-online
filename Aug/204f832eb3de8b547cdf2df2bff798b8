Residents of Wentworth, south of Durban, say they are living in fear, following the escalation of gang-related violence in recent weeks. Ward Committee member for Safety Clint Leverton alleges that shooting incidents have been a common occurrence in the Wentworth area for several years. Leverton says the on-going violence is claiming the lives of innocent people, who get caught in the cross-fire. “On Wednesday, there was a shootout which ensued and one person was shot and another one was run-over by a getaway vehicle, which we hear eventually passed away in hospital. The other shooting which took place was on Monday where a man was shot in the leg while walking up the road going to the shop. Apparently, last week Friday a man who was sitting in his yard there was gun violence going on between two rivals and sitting in his yard he was shot dead.” Leverton says community members are afraid of coming forward with information. “People are feeling scared but, at the same time, we have a community that knows who the perpetrators are but are afraid to come forward and speak.” KwaZulu-Natal police have confirmed the death of one person in a shootout last week.
