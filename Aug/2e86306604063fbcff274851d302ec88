KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has just completed the 10 kilometre race. “I finished at least within 1 hour 4 minutes. It’s always good to run and it is part of ensuring that we encourage healthy lifestyle, but for us as government in KwaZulu-Natal Mandela Marathon has grown to become what it is. We started it 8 years ago – it is now big whenever we open the registration within few weeks you find that we have reached the target … we want to thank the people of Africa for supporting us.”  Inkosi Zwelivelile Mandla Mandela and some of his family members are also participating in this year’s race.
