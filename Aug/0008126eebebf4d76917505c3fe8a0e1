African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General, Ace Magashule, remains non-committal on whether or not he would appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry, investigating allegations of state capture. The former Free State Economic Development MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana, implicated Magashule in corruption during his tenure as premier. Magashule and other NEC members are in the four districts of the North West Province to interact with members and introduce the newly established Interim Provincial Committee. Magashule also committed that the National Executive Committee  (NEC) will hasten to quell the fire in Kwa-Zulu Natal, after  Ethekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, rescinded her resignation. “Let’s give that commission a platform. Many people want to go to that commission so leave it there. I am not worried at all. The truth shall prevail. It’s a commission not a court of law. So, lawyers and legal people are the advisors of us.” The ruling party also faces a mammoth task quelling the fires in KwaZulu-Natal. “We are going to engage with the provincial officials of KZN. We have engaged comrade Gumede and we discuss our matter as the African National Congress internally. We have good leadership both in KZN and other provinces. We have listened to comrade Gumede . We are going to listen to the leadership of the province,” says Magashule. The NEC’s visit to the North West comes a few weeks after the formation of the Interim Provincial Structure. This is the third structure to be established since the dissolution of the PEC last year.
