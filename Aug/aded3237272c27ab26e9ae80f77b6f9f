KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Arts and Culture Hlengiwe Mvimbela has visited the survivors of a crash,  Saturday night, that claimed the lives of seven people, including six maidens on the R33 between Dundee and Pomeroy. Nine maidens sustained serious injuries and were rushed to hospital for burn wounds. The maidens were driving back from a Siyaya eMhlangeni event in preparation for next month’s annual Reed Dance. Mavimbela says she will work with the Transport Department to ensure the safety of other maidens who will be travelling to Nongoma for the Reed Dance. “They have got serious injuries. It’s so painful some lost their lives. We are very sorry to the families our heartfelt condolences to them it’s not acceptable to loose life. So we are appealing to the community at large to be with us with the families while we are praying and giving them support. At this difficult time,” says Mavimbela.
