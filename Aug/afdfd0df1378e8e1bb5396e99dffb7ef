The chairperson of Transnet Dr. Popo Molefe says he’s waiting for those who have embarked on a smear campaign to discredit the on-going anti-corruption drive at the state-owned enterprise to put what they’ve been saying to the test. Some Transnet staff are allegedly involved in billions of rands’ worth of kickbacks as well as wasteful expenditure. Reports say they’ve bought luxury vehicles and even houses for cash and are unable to explain how they managed to afford them. Molefe says the campaign will not deter them from cleaning up Transnet… “I’m waiting for them to say it in public because I don’t want to become an accessory to something that could be defamatory. I’m waiting for them to put what they are saying in the public domain. There is a campaign; it’s an attack on all of those people who are dealing with matters of corruption.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/727644">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
