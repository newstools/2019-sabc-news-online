South African Airways (SAA) says it will only get an update later on Monday evening on the situation at Hong Kong International Airport and whether flights can be resumed to and from the country. SAA has cancelled flights to and from Hong Kong following a mass demonstration that shut down the country’s international airport. The airline has advised customers to contact the airline or travel agent to reschedule flights or receive an update. Pro-democracy demonstrations have continued for over two months in Hong Kong. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali says they are working with other carriers to limit the impact on passengers “The situation will be reviewed or assessed at approximately midnight South African time and about six in the evening in Hong Kong time, that is the time at which we will get an update as to whether or not carriers that operate to Hong Kong or out of Hong Kong will be able to resume operations.” “We are doing everything possible to assist passengers including those who have to travel beyond a point in South Africa as well as the points in Hong Kong where we have been liaising with other carriers to be able to operate and to carry our passengers beyond those points.”
