The case brought by former National Prosecution Authority (NPA) senior official Nomgcobo Jiba in the Western Cape High Court to interdict parliament has been postponed to the 19th of September. Jiba wants parliament to halt the process of deciding whether she and Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi should be restored or removed from their positions, while she challenges the president’s decision to fire her in court. On Tuesday Parliament’s Justice Committee decided to postpone its proceedings pending the outcome of Jiba’s interdict application. President Cyril Ramaphosa fired Jiba and Mrwebi in April after a commission chaired by retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro recommended that they be dismissed from the NPA.
