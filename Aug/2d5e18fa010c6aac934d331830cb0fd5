The Commission of Inquiry into impropriety into the PIC continues to hear testimony on Monday  in Pretoria. The Commission postponed hearings two weeks ago due to the Tshwane Bus Service employees strike action in the capital city on August 1. This is the last week the commission will be hearing testimony’s. It will thereafter compile its report and give the final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa in October. PIC former CEO Dan Matjila and other witnesses are expected to continue to give evidence. Matjila is expected to continue to give sequence of events that led to the PIC giving Ayo Technologies Solution a R4.3 billion funding facility. He will later detail the PIC and its involvement into the embattled VBS Mutual bank.  It has been a long road for the commission since President Cyril Ramaphosa announced its establishment last year in August to investigate “the veracity of alleged improprieties” at the PIC. The commission was instituted with the aim of restoring confidence in the state-owned asset manager. The Commission has so far heard testimony from 70 witnesses who have implicated the PIC CEO Dan Matjila and other top former PIC executives of wrongdoing. Matjila has so far denied flouting PIC procedures and other wrongdoing at the corporation.
