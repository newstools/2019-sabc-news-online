The family of the man, who allegedly confessed to killing his girlfriend and burying her body in a shallow grave inside a shack in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, says they sympathise with the family of the deceased. The 28-year-old man was arrested on Sunday night, after he voluntarily pointed police to a shack where the body of his 41-year-old girlfriend was found buried in a shallow grave under his bed. The deceased had been missing for two months. The suspect appeared in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto on Tuesday on charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. The case was postponed to the 20th of September. “We never expected something like this. When he was not drunk, he was a good person; but once he drinks he becomes violent. Our relationship was like brother and sister who will fight at times, but not to reach this stage. When they called me, I thought maybe he was beaten up because he likes to fight. Even now, I don’t believe,” says the accused sister, Thembi Sithole.
