Lesotho Parliament will reopen on Friday. The National Assembly was closed sine-die two months ago, with Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane narrowly dodging a vote of no confidence that was planned within his own party and supported by opposition. President Cyril Ramaphosa, assisted by Retired Deputy Justice Dikgang Moseneke brokered a deal leading to the reopening of parliament so as to enact the National Reforms Authority. Lesotho Prime Minister was able to dodge a bullet. His own party wanted him removed from the top office through a vote of no confidence, but the plot was swiftly averted by closing the parliament sine-die as he battles to contain his imploding party. In an effort to avert a crisis, a soft diplomacy from Southern African Development Community through President Ramaphosa nudged all stake holders to sign a deal that aims to insulate the reforms process to completion, regardless of who is at the helm of power. Meanwhile, the youth have released a joint position expressing inadequate representation in the proposed Reform Authority, citing they demand a 40% stake in the quota. Although the reopening of parliament is primarily to prioritise the reforms bill, it offers no guarantees regarding the fate of the Prime Minister.
