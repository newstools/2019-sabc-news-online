Thousands of African National Congress (ANC) members, who claim to represent the 110 ANC branches in the eThekwini region, have come out in support of the provincial leadership’s decision to recall eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede. Gumede was recalled along with Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo and other members of the executive in the two municipalities. Tension within the ANC in eThekwini has been brewing for months. They stem from a decision to first place Gumede on special leave which was later extended and then her recent recall. This flows from her being charged with corruption and fraud, relating to an alleged irregular R208 million tender. She’s out on R50 000 bail and is due back in court in January next year. The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) said its decision to recall the office bearers was based on an assessment of the performance of the municipalities. Sunday’s gathering comes after Gumede’s supporters disrupted a meeting on Friday where provincial leaders were meant to explain Gumede’s recall. The ANC leadership this week is expected to announce who will fill the positions of mayor and the other executive committee members in the two municipalities. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
