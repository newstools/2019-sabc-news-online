Two senior African National Congress (ANC) members in Mpumalanga have been served with letters of suspension. This follows skirmishes in which the party’s acting provincial secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali was allegedly assaulted three weeks ago. There’s speculation that the suspended ANC members are the chairperson of the now disbanded Ehlanzeni region, Ngrayi Ngwenya. and acting treasurer Phindile Nkuna. Ngwenya and Nkuna allegedly assaulted Ntshalintshali during the announcement of the disbandment of the region. The matter was reported to the police and to the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC). Ntshalitshali says the party is dealing with the issue. “It’s an NEC decision. The SGO is the one that deals with that. Remember we have our own organisational protocols in terms of how we communicate. What I can confirm is that those members have been served. They know the decision of the NEC now but members are aware and they’ve got processes that are outlined in terms of responding within a certain period surrounding those incidences,” says Ntshalitshali. Chairperson of the now disbanded Ehlanzeni region Ngwenya has confirmed his suspension but has vowed to take the matter to court. “I’m going to challenge the matter according to the law, not for the RGC. I don’t care with the RG. I’m challenging my membership. I want to clear my name. If the ANC does want me, I don’t have a problem. I cannot force to be in the ANC, it was my choice. The NEC cannot entertain anything which is not the decision of the PEC,” explains Ngwenya.
