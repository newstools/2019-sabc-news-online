Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has shut down 20 bogus schools at Ivory Park in Ekurhuleni. This follows an SABC News expose last week on illegal private schools operating in the area. The Department says the bogus schools include Star Combined, Four Comprehensive and Our Legacy Combined, which accounted for more than 400 learners. Lesufi says efforts are under way to make sure that all affected learners can be accommodated in neighbouring schools. “It’s worrying, a free movement of people that don’t want to adhere to the country’s rules and regulations. I can tell you, to take those more than 500 kids in the middle of the year like this, they need new teachers, they need textbooks, they need all these things, so it’s going to be a serious problem.” “But the future of the children comes first, we can’t postpone their future. If you can’t assist them now, you’re destroying them permanently.” Click video below:
