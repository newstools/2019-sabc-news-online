The Presidency has broken its silence about the CR17 campaign emails. It says it questions whether or not the emails, revealing some of the donors to the CR17 campaign have made their way into the public domain legally. Spokesperson, Khusela Diko says it’s not fair for President Cyril Ramaphosa to be dragged into his campaign donations because he was not involved in soliciting money from potential donors for his African National Congress presidential campaign in 2017. This comes after News24 published several emails and names of the people who the managers of Ramaphosa’s campaign had approached for funding. The publication says the emails have been verified. However, Diko says the President also donated his personal money to the campaign. “There is a substance of the issues that are raised there – now there is one email for an example where it said the president was instructing a certain Donald to deposit money into the fund-raising account, now that is true and it supports what we have said to the Public Protector that the president had donated some of his personal money into the campaign. We’ve also said to the public protector that the president did attend fund-raising dinners and there would be times where his guidance was sought in terms of whether to support a certain donor or not – but at the end of the day, the entire campaign was run in such a way that he is not involved in the day to day running of the funding and in soliciting of that funding.”
