The Phase II of a multi-million rand programme aimed at strengthening the fight against lung cancer has been launched at Addington Hospital in Durban. The R40 million projects is funded by the Bristol-Myers Squibb foundation. It will benefit five KwaZulu-Natal communities located around hospitals that offer oncology services. They are Umlazi, Chatsworth, South Durban Basin, Imbali and Sobantu. Foundation President John Damonti says Phase One of the project began in 2017 and saw a team of scientists conducting research in countries such as Kenya, Swaziland, Tanzania and South Africa. “Today which is the beginning of Phase two is the opportunity to start to put that learning and research that was done in Phase one into action and infrastructure, equipment and training so that we can now effectively treat in the most cost effective way possible.” Related video click below:
