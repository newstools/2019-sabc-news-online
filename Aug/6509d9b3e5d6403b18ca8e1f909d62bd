The Independent Electoral Commision (IEC) in the Free State says despite experiencing a few challenges Maluti-a-Phofung municipal by-elections went according to plan. All 91 voting stations in the region opened on time. Queues started to form from as early as seven o’clock in the morning. Some voters were turned away as their names did not appear on the voters’ roll and voting was almost disrupted in Ward 10 when gang violence erupted. “We don’t know what is happening here. People have been voting here but were turned away. People must not be denied their opportunity to vote,” says a voter. The IEC says it has managed to deal with Voters roll issues. Itumeleng Liba, a Free State Electoral Officer says: “People must vote where they have registered. I would say they are taking chances. But you will find a person is registered in another ward and want to go and vote at the other ward.” Excited residents say they voted for change. “We want changes. We want water and electricity,” says a resident. “We want to vote for a party that will change our lives because ANC has forgotten about us,” adds another resident. The contest for 15 vacant wards involves 89 candidates from six political parties as well as 16 independent candidates. The municipality is currently under administration due to collapse in governance. WATCH BELOW:
