Construction of a new R60 billion forensic pathology laboratory at the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg will be completed by June next year. Gauteng Premier David Makhura visited the construction site on Thursday. It’s hoped the facility will reduce delays in conducting autopsies. Makhura says the laboratory will be a state of the art facility with advanced technology. “Some of the problems we have in our continent about the outbreaks of pandemics of diseases like Ebola, we have a facility that is rising here. This is going to help a great deal. The problem with Hillbrow is that it was too small and over time it couldn’t cope with the new technology we are going to have here. What we call the state of the art will help us a lot to get those forensic investigations done about the circumstance why someone has passed on.”
