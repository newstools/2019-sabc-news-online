The African Global Operations CEO, formerly known as Bosasa, has died in a car crash. Watson reportedly passed away on the R21 near the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Monday morning. The details of the incident are not yet clear.  Watson was implicated at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in relation to allegations of corruption at Bosasa. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi testified at the Commission that Watson paid bribes to various politicians, including Nomvula Mokonyane and Gwede Mantashe. Video evidence showed Watson handling hard cash. Agrizzi said that money was used to pay bribes and that Bosasa paid up to R6 million in bribes monthly. Agrizzi also recorded a clip where Watson was allegedlyÂ rehearsing what he intended to tell former president Jacob Zuma in their planned meeting where they were to discuss who Zuma needed to appoint to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in order to protect Bosasa from prosecution.
