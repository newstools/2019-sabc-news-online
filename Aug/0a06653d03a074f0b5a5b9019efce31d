Parliament’s Justice Committee is likely to forward the discussion on the fitness to hold office of Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane to the Rules Committee. This is according to the chairperson of the Justice Committee, Bulelani Mangwanishe. The committee is scheduled to discuss how to start a Parliamentary procedure for the removal of the Public Protector, on Tuesday. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has asked for the removal of Mkhwebane. The party was the first to express concerns about the suitability of Mkhwebane when she was appointed by President Jacob Zuma in 2016. Mangwanishe says the matter will be moved out of their hands to the Rules Committee. “Currently, there are no rules to effect the removal of a Chapter Nine institution; not only the PP, but the Human Rights Commission, the Auditor General and others. So, part of us discussing that procedure, it will be to say, ‘let’s refer this matter to the Rules (Committee), so that we develop the appropriate rules.'” Watch a related video below:
