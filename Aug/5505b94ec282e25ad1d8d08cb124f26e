Officials in Tanzania say two South Africans have been killed in a plane crash in the west of the country early on Saturday. The light plane with registration ZU-TAF-19 is a four-seater Sling plane from South Africa. The pilot and passenger, both South African citizens, were killed in the crash that occurred shortly after take-off from Tabora airport. The plane was owned by South African organisation ‘U-Dream Global’. The plane burst into flames when it crashed, and only the engine and some parts of the plane were recovered. The Tanzanian Civil Aviation Authority says the plane, which entered Tanzania’s airspace from Uganda en route to Malawi, made a distress signal about engine failure before disappearing from radar.
