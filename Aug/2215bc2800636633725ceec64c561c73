Former Communications Minister, Faith Muthambi has lashed out at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) report, calling it hogwash. Muthambi was responding to the report released on Monday by the commission led by veteran journalist Joe Thloloe. The report found that Muthambi had interfered in the editorial independence of the public broadcaster. Her response comes amid the Democratic Allianc’s (DA) threats to lay criminal charges against her. Muthambi, who has been accused of bullying journalists at the organisation, says she was not given the opportunity to respond to the allegations. She says Thloloe failed the commission’s own terms of reference by not investigating the merits of the allegations against her. She adds that her name was rubbished, without her being granted the opportunity to tell her side of the story. Thloloe said he would not respond to Muthambi’s statement at this point.
