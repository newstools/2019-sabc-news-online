Over 80 students from Mpumalanga will leave the country in September to study medicine and engineering in Russia. Speaking at a send-off ceremony held in White River, MEC for Education, Bonakele Majuba encouraged the group to represent the country with pride. Majuba says the group will be joining the 282 students who have been studying in the Russia since 2015. “We started this programme because we wanted to give opportunities to our learners. Those who are academically excellent to have opportunities to go and study and experience studies overseas. We chose Russia because we have good relations with Russia and we hope and believe these kids, who have got good results from their matric … so that they can go and study overseas to be engineers, doctors … that’s what we are doing. But we concentrate more on those learners who have good results, but who are coming from disadvantaged communities.”
