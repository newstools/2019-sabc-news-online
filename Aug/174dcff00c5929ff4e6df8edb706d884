Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says government is determined to win the battle against disobedient motorists and persistent road fatalities. Mbalula has addressed the media on the AARTO demerit system recently signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The system allows for the suspension of a driver’s licence if he or she obtains 12 demerit points for traffic offences. Mbalula says he’s optimistic the AARTO demerit system will help reduce road carnage. He addressed members of the media on the N1 outside Pretoria. “The AARTO is not just about punishment but intentions to ensure compliance and change of road users’ behaviour, assessing law enforcement in Johannesburg and Tshwane where AARTO is being implemented.” “We look forward to engaging with officials at all spheres of government as we work together to put in place the necessary regulations for the roll out.” “We’ve won an important battle but the war against road fatalities is not yet over, as we look at many victories ahead of ensuring safer roads.” Related video click below:
