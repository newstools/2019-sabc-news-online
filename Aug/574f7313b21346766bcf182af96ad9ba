The 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who arrived in New York earlier this week after a zero carbon two week trip in a sailboat across the Atlantic has led a “strike” outside the United Nation Headquarters to raise awareness about the imminent dangers of Climate Change. Greta Thunberg was on Wednesday greeted by a flotilla of boats near New York harbour as she arrived on an emission free racing yacht that took her across the Atlantic from Europe. The action is part of a series of youth events that will culminate during the UN Climate Change Summit on September 23. “The climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis and the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced and if we don’t manage to work together to cooperate and to work together despite our differences then we will fail. So we need to stand together and support each other and to take action because otherwise it might be too late. Let’s not wait any longer, let’s do it now,” says Thunberg.   With a throng of people surrounding her, she has inspired youth activists around the world after starting a solitary protest outside the Swedish Parliament that has snowballed into a global movement.  With this movement culminating in a much larger Climate Change “Strike” on September 20 – just ahead of the UN Summit. “We stand united. Youth across the world and across the country are coming together to strike on the 20th. And we’re asking you – everyone here and everyone watching – no matter how old you are or where you come from to join us to strike for our future, to strike for a better world, and to strive for climate justice,” says Youth Climate Activist, Sophie Anderson. World leaders are pressured to bring concrete plans and not just nice words, with climate skeptic U.S. President Donald Trump coming in for some criticism. It’s a global emergency that requires all hands on deck – and the young peopleare pointing the way. Watch video below:
