The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department has officially launched an e-learning program in the province. The program has been launched at eMadungeni Combined School at eBomvini village in Ixopo. Through the program, learners and educators will use technology and the internet to access their respective curriculum. The Department of Education says it is embracing the 4th Industrial Revolution through information and communications technology (ICT) to increase access to the internet and expand educational curricula at all levels of schooling. Education MEC  Kwazi Mshengu says e-learning is quickly becoming an asset not only to the learners but to communities and teachers as well. Mshengu says e-learning will also be rolled out to other districts in the province. “We are going to roll out this programme throughout the province of KwaZulu-Natal with more target particularly to rural schools because we want to turn these schools into schools of choice. We don’t want learners in rural schools and township schools to feel pressured that they should go to urban areas in order for them to get quality education. We are therefore bringing quality education to rural schools, so we are quite excited about the launch today. We want to also make a call to communities to protect these schools, to protect the equipment because we are building the future of our country and the province of KwaZulu-Natal in particular.”
