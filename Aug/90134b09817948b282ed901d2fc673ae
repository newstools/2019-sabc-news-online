Mzimkhulu Thebola has been sworn in as the new mayor of the Msunduzi Municipality in Pietermaritzburg, while Eunice Majola has been elected as the new Speaker of the municipality, which has been holding its full council meeting to elect new office bearers. This after office bearers including the former mayor Themba Njilo were recalled earlier this month. Meanwhile, the eThekwini metro council meeting which was scheduled for Thursday has been postponed, after the embattled mayor Zandile Gumede retracted her resignation late on Wednesday. Gumede says she wants to plead her case with the African National Congress (ANC) top six at national level. Thebola will have to urgently address issues of maladministration in the municipality. There are also claims that corruption is rife, as a result of which the municipality was put under administration. In his maiden speech Thebola told the council that work would begin Friday as the monies in the municipality had run dry and a request had been made to the provincial government to assist and get back on track.
