Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize says the government is using bio-technology to address serious diseases like HIV and tuberculosis. He addressed the Bio Africa Convention underway at the Durban’s International Convention Centre. The three-day event brings together policymakers, regulators and researchers from across the continent. Mkhize says bio-technology is the key to modern health care. He says, “The most valuable component of bio-technology in the context of health reform is intellectual capital. The government had committed itself to science, technology and innovation to harness life sciences, research for health and economic development.” “The Department of Science and Technology, its partners and the SA Medical Research Council are conducting research on human genomic variations in the country and to apply genomic to address local health needs, HIV and TB,” Mkhize adds. Meanwhile, three labour federations are embarking on a massive drive to have workers in the mining, retail and farming sectors screened and tested for HIV/AIDS. Click below to watch video:
