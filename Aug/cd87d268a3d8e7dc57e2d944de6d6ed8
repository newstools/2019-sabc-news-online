Rand Water says water supply will be restored to suburbs in the East and North of Johannesburg by 20:00 on Sunday. Several areas including Germiston, Bedfordview, Primrose, Kempton Park, Halfway House and Rooihuiskraal were left without water from Saturday, after a major pipe burst on Friday night. Rand Water Executive manager for Operations, Eddie Singo says it appears that a valve was vandalised, which resulted in the pipe bursting. “We now know the extent of the damage, we are currently doing preparations in terms of the repairs themselves so our technicians and artisans and welders are now on site just to be given a clear,  so they can be able to start work. We anticipate that at around 20:00 tonight we should be commissioning that pipeline.”
