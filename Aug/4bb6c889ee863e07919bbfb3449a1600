The chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, the Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has adjourned proceedings to Thursday in Parktown, Johannesburg. Evidence leader Advocate Leah Gcabashe requested that the testimony of Wednesday’s witness be postponed to later next month. They will on Thursday continue with testimony from the former HOD of the Free State Agriculture Department, Peter Thabethe. The inquiry has been hearing testimonies regarding the controversial Estina Dairy Farm project in Vrede in the Free State. More than R200-million in public funds allocated to the project, meant to benefit black emerging farmers, was allegedly paid into accounts of Gupta linked companies. Zondo says he’s aware of the reasons for the postponement. “I’m therefore happy to adjourn the hearing of the evidence to Friday the 20th & Saturday 21st of September 2019 at 10 o’clock on each day, so we will, therefore, adjourn today’s (Wednesday’s) proceedings but tomorrow (Thursday) we will proceed as planned for this week, we will then adjourn and tomorrow (Thursday) we start at 10 o’ clock.”
