The late African National Congress (ANC) veteran Nomathemba Sidandala will be laid to rest on Friday, at Mlungisi Township in Komani, Eastern Cape. She died last week after a long illness at the age of 79. Her political activism dates back in the late 60s when she joined the ANC. She played an active role in establishing underground structures of the ANC including recruiting uMkhonto Wesizwe cadres during the apartheid era. Sidandala has been granted a provincial official funeral. Premier Lubabalo Mabuyane says her passing is a great loss to the movement. “We honour her and we give the due regard to people of her calibre. We want to convey our deepest message of condolences to the family. You understand that people like former President Nelson Mandela when they came out of jail, part of people that he had to actually acknowledge was her. Even also the role that she played during the TRC. So we are really indebted to such people, we are losing this quality at a time when we need such people, their wisdom moving forward,” adds Mabuyane.
