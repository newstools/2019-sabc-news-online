French President Emmanuel Macron met with United Nation’s Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday on the sidelines of a G7 summit that will likely expose deep rifts over a clutch of issues such as global trade, climate change and taxing big tech. Macron, the summit host, planned the three-day meeting in the Atlantic seaside resort of Biarritz as a chance to unite a group of wealthy countries that has struggled in recent years to speak with one voice. Macron set an agenda for the group – France, Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States – that included the defense of democracy, gender equality, education and the environment. He invited Asian, African and Latin American leaders to join them for a global push on these issues.
