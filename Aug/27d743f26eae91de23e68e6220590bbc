The National Health Insurance (NHI) has been described as the convention that will overhaul democratic South Africa’s health system. Delegates at the Hospital Association of South Africa conference have acknowledged that the National Health Insurance will force them to change the way they do business. The NHI took centre-stage at this week’s three-day conference in Cape Town. Another issue that dominated discussions included the healthcare human resource challenges. Clinical Directorate Executive at Life Healthcare Doctor Paul Soko says there’s a lot of anxiety around the NHI. “I think it’s quite evident that we are at the cross roads of healthcare, and in fact there is a narrative that says that the NHI bill itself is to the healthcare fraternity what CODESA was to the political settlement in 1994. I think the common thread in that is that it evokes a lot of emotion, there’s a lot of uncertainty, there’s a lot of anxiety.”
