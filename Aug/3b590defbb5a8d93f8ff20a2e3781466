KwaZulu-Natal Ezemvelo Wildlife rangers are still searching for a lion that escaped from the uMfolozi Game Reserve. It is believed that on Monday two lions escaped. KwaZulu-Natal Ezemvelo Wildlife spokesperson Musa Mntambo says one lion was shot dead during the search, while another managed to escape. Mnmabo would not be drawn into why the lion was shot dead and not simply darted. “We received a call on Monday regarding those two lions and our guys went to look for them on Tuesday and one was shot dead and the other one ran towards the park so we assumed it was inside the park. But our guys are still looking for it because it might be injured where it is.” Mntambo says repairs on the reserve fencing that had been damaged; allowing the lions to escape, is underway. “We’ve employed more than 250 people who are going to put a new fence around Hluhluwe and uMfolozi Park. They have been working in the park from August 19. They are there until towards the end of December.”
