The Speaker of the eThekwini Metro, Willam Lekgoa-Mapena has shot down a motion of no confidence on the embattled mayor, Zandile Gumede. Opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) tabled the motion. Gumede has been on leave since June on the instructions of the African National Congress (ANC) following her arrest on corruption charges. She is out on bail of R50 000 for allegedly defrauding the city of millions of rands. The DA’s Nicole Graham and IFP’s Mdu Nkosi share their frustrations. “You wrote to me to say it has been received, but I have not noticed it on the agenda…. When did you send it?…. Check your emails…. I have checked about half an hour ago….  You sent a letter through email and then I responded through email…. Councillor Nkosi…. We are not school kids here!” Watch a related video below:
