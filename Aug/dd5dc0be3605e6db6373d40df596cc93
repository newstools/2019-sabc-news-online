Parents of learners at Thuto Lesedi Secondary School in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg, want the principal and the school governing body removed. This follows allegations that a Grade 9 learner was raped in the school toilets by two Grade 12 boys in July. The parents, together with members of student body Cosas and ANC Women’s League are protesting outside the school. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is meeting with the school management. One parent, who spoke to SABC News on condition of anonymity, says, “We are sick and tired of this school. This school has a problem. We want the principal and the SGB to be removed with immediate effect before the community takes the law into their own hand. We are very sick and tired of this.” Lesufi says at least 70 cases of rape of learners have been reported in the Gauteng Education Department in 2019. He says while he is also concerned about safety in schools, his department cannot afford to have security guards in every school across the province. “We’ve got less than 70 cases that have been reported out of 2.3 million learners. I don’t want to underscore the importance of the cases that have been reported. The cases that we have, indeed they are worrying. One case is too many. I’ve met with all the principals and SGBs in the province on the issues of girl children and girl support and I can assure you the cases have [not been ignored]. I wish I can have a security guard in each and every school, but reality is I don’t have the budget to do so.”
