Judge Letty Molopa-Sethosa has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa has made a case to interdict Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s remedial action in the Ivan Pillay pension payout matter. Ramaphosa brought an urgent application against Mkhwebane, seeking to suspend the implementation of the remedial action, arguing against disciplining Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan pending a judicial review. This relates to Mkhwebane’s findings on Gordhan’s approval of former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay’s early retirement with full pension payout in 2010. Judge Molopa-Sethosa says she is satisfied that the President has made a case for an interdict against the remedial action, as instructed by the Public Protector. “Looking at the conduct, the engagement of the President and more specifically at the letter the President read with the remedial action imposed on him, the President has complied. There is no time frame set out by the PP, nor the form of implementation and on the issue then of a declarator. I am satisfied that the President has made out a case for the relief sought.” Click below to watch related video:
