The High Court in Pretoria has ruled in favour of an application to review and set aside the findings of the Seriti Commission of Inquiry into the controversial arms deal. Civil organisations, Right2Know (R2K) and Corruption Watch have argued that Judge Willie Seritiâ€™s 2016 findings misled the public by exonerating politicians and public servants in wrongdoing during the arms deal saga. R2K says they believe the commission was selective in choosing who would testify or present evidence. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo handed down the judgment. Click below to watch court proceedings:
