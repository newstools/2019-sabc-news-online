The opposition DA says it is happy with the resolution of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services on the process to remove Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The committee has now referred the matter to the Speaker of Parliament so that the Rules Committee can deliberate on this matter before the process begins. Chief Whip of the Official Opposition John Steenhuisen says he is pleased with the development. “I think that this will be a small delay at the beginning but I think it will potentially face huge delays as Miss Mkhwebane would obviously try and dig in to retain her position and prevent parliament from continuing. So what the rules would do is flesh out the powers given to parliament by the constitution and the public protector act to conduct this inquiry and then the inquiry would get under way unchallenged hopefully.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/737758">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
