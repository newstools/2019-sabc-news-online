The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has confirmed that one of its MPs received funds from President Cyril Ramaphosa that was allegedly taken out of the account that managed the funds for his African National Congress (ANC) presidential campaign in 2017. MP Tebogo Mokwele has confirmed that she received R40 000 from Ramaphosa allegedly through his CR17 account. The EFF says Mokwele told the party leadership about the money and that it related to a personal problem. The EFF claims the admission confirms that the President was directly involved in the CR17 account. Party spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the money was given as a form of condolence over the deaths of two of Mokwele’s family members in April this year. “The aunt of Mokwele and her husband were shot dead in a situation that was believed to be a robbery and President Ramaphosa gave her the R40 000 as a condolence. This comes to us as a confirmation that Ramaphosa had a direct knowledge because the money came from a CR17 account, this is two years or so later the money came in on a situation that happened this year and Ramaphosa has been saying the money of his campaign he didn’t know anything about this. But this is evidence that he was very aware and he could even give instruction for money to be delivered from those accounts.”  WATCH BELOW:
