Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula will on Thursday launch the Ministerial War Room on Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa). Mbalula made the announcement during his department’s Budget Vote speech last month. The war room is in response to the number of deadly train crashes in the country. It will monitor trains, check for arrival times and address infrastructure problems at Prasa. The department’s spokesperson Ayanda Allie-Paine says this is part of modernising Prasa’s modernisation programme. She says R170-million has been set aside to replace the old trains. “One of the objectives is service recovery – to make sure that we pay attention to rolling stock availability and reliability, infrastructure availability, the train’s performance, making sure that the trains arrive on time, making sure that we have safety and security. So safety and security management is quite important. People need to know that when they get on a train they will get to their destination without any crashes and without any collision.”
