The ANC’s National Working Committee (NWC) says the state of municipalities and governance in the North West is worrying. This emerged during a meeting between the ANC NWC and the ANC provincial structures, held in Rustenburg, North West, on Saturday. The meeting was held to introduce the interim provincial structure, and to give the party’s public servants strict marching orders. The NWC members met with the province’s regional leadership, party councillors and mayors including members of the provincial legislature. ANC Deputy Secretary General, Jessie Duarte says they have put together an Interim Provincial Committee. “We have put together what we call an Interim Provincial Committee, to assist us to rebuild the branches of the ANC, to make sure that there are no double branches, to take the regions that are due for conferences to conferences. And to work towards a provincial conference, where we will elect a leadership that will be focused on unifying the ANC.” Coordinator for the Interim Provincial Committee, Hlomane Chauke, says his Committee will leave no stone unturned on all municipalities that are implicated in the VBS saga. “We know that public money cannot be invested. Public money is meant to deliver services to the people. And those that are found to have done that definitely we are not going to leave them. We’ll have to deal with that. But we’ll have to recover the money. MFMA and PFMA, they are very clear, on what you do when there’s misuse of public money, especially irregular expenditure. There must be investigation, and the action must be taken, and we are going to take action, against those who have done that,” says Chauke. Watch video below:
