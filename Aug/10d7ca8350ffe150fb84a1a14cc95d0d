The former national director of Public Prosecutions Mxolisi Nxasana says the former Justice minister Jeff Radebe was the first person he told about a campaign to oust him. Nxasana says Radebe was also the first person who told him to resign. Nxasana left his position after former President Jacob Zuma offered him a R17, 3 million golden handshake. Last year the Constitutional Court ordered Nxasana to pay back R10 million of the money. Nxasana told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that he refused to resign. “That was the initial push, they tried to push me then I refused then he said I must resign and they agreed with the DG Sindane. I told them I was not going to do that, and then he said to me that the President will have to appoint the commission of inquiry.  I left the meeting,” says Nxasana.
