The African National Congress (ANC)’s Provincial Secretary in Limpopo, Soviet Lekganyane, says no action should be taken against the residents of the Mogalakwena municipality, which includes Mokopane, following Friday’s total shutdown. The residents demanded justice over the murders of two ANC politicians. One of those killed, Valtyn Kekana, will be laid to rest on Saturday at Moshate village outside Mokopane. Kekana, who was also the chairperson of the Municipal Public Accounts Committee, was about to release a report on financial irregularities in the municipality. Speaking on the side-lines of the funeral service, Lekganyane says the residents have a right to be frustrated as corruption has plagued the region for more than a decade. “We must pardon the people if they lose their temper. You’d know that this municipality has not seen stability for a period now spanning to a decade. In fact, in the last ten years they might have had up to five murders.” “Ordinary people on the ground are being denied services which they so much deserve, and there is no explanation why. There have been very serious allegations about maladministration in that municipality. There is an amount of over R1 billion that has been lost in unauthorised expenditure. What do you expect the residents to do,” adds Lekganyane.
