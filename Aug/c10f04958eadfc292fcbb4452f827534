The investigating officer in the Colin Pillay triple murder trial, Kumarasan Pillay, is expected to continue his testimony in the High Court in Durban on Thursday morning. Forty-six-year-old Collin Pillay is accused of killing his married lover Jane Govindasamy and her two daughters, Denisha and Rackelle, in September last year. He has pleaded not guilty to the murders. He has also been charged with the theft of a cellphone and money. Their bodies were discovered by Govindasamy’s husband Sagren in their Phoenix flat north of Durban. On Wednesday, Pillay told the court that the accused Colin Pillay was arrested at a lodge in Palmview, Phoenix north of Durban, a day after the murders were committed. He said during his interviews with witnesses it was revealed that Colin went fishing with his nephew and brother after the bodies of Jane and her daughters were discovered. He said one witness identified a man wearing a blue and white baseball jacket walking to the victims’ home hours before the murders were committed. A similar jacket was seized from the accused.
