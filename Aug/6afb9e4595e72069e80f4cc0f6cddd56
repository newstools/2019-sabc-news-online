Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Friday he will deploy federal troops with appropriate equipment to fight the fires in the Amazon rain forest, blaming dryer-than-normal weather for the spike in fire outbreaks this year. In a speech on national television, Bolsonaro said the government was very aware of the situation and will fight”environmental crime” the same way it fights ordinary crime. He said, however, that the spread of “false information”regarding the situation in northern Brazil “does not help to solve it.  Hundreds turned out in Lima, Peru and Buenos Aires, Argentina on Friday calling for great protection for the Amazon amidst raging wildfires. The surge in fires has alarmed environmentalists who blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for undermining protection of the world’s largest tropical rainforest and turning a blind eye to illegal deforestation by farmers and land grabbers. The wildfires have sparked international criticism of Bolsonaro’s handling of the destruction of the rainforest, which produces more than 20% of the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere and is considered a vital brake on climate change. Peru shares the Amazon with Brazil and Peruvians have vowed to defend the forest from destruction. Bolsonaro has vowed to open up the Amazon region to more agriculture and mining, even on indigenous reservations that are seen as the most protected parts of the rainforest. This week French President Emmanuel Macron and U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed concerns about wildfires that are raging in the Amazon, but Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has responded angrily to international pressure as meddling.
