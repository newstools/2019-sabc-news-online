African National Congress (ANC) heavyweights Deputy President David Mabuza and the party’s Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte are expected to descend on the troubled Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality at QwaQwa in the Free State This follows a political fall-out which led to the expulsion of 16 party councilors. They were found guilty of voting with the opposition during the removal of former executive mayor, Vusi Tshabalala. As a result of those vacancies in 15 wards, by-elections will take place.  The expelled councilors have announced that they will contest the 28 August by-elections as independent candidates. They include former Executive Mayor, Gilbert Mokotso. The distressed Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality has since been placed under administration. The municipality has been plagued by service delivery challenges which resulted in violent protests.
