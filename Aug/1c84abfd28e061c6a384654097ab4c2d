The South African Society of Bank Officials (SASBO) has accused major banks of failing to allow a facilitator from the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to mediate following consultations on retrenchments. SASBO is threatening to shut down the banking sector for two days next month if banks do not respond to their concerns over retrenchments. It says Standard Bank, ABSA and Nedbank are planning to retrench thousands of workers, which will add to the country’s growing unemployment rate. SASBO’s General Secretary Joe Kokel claims consultations with the banks were a mere formality. “After we consulted with the banks under the pretext of Section 189, it clearly states that all that has to happen is for us to reach a consensus. In fact the banks came to us just to tick the list that they have consulted with us.” “Some of those discussions needed for us to have a facilitator from the CCMA and the problem was that most of the employers were not willing for us to have the facilitation. So at the end of the day they went ahead to do what they have to do.” Click below to watch related video:
