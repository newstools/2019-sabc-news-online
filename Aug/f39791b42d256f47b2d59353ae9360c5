Members of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Moses Mabhida region are currently protesting outside their party offices in Pietermaritzburg. The Regional Executive Committee was disbanded in September last year. This was done because its term came to an end. The ANC however, chose to have an interim structure while it prepared for the general elections, than hold a regional elective conference at the time. Disgruntled ANC members are now saying the lifespan of the interim structure – the Regional Task Team has expired. Last week the ANC recalled the city’s Mayor, Themba Njilo, together with all the other ANC members on the city’s executive committee. One of the ANC branch leaders, Sthembiso Nkuna says they do not want the current task team to oversee the build up to their conference. “We are here this morning to again remind our leadership that since the time of the disbandment of REC and the formation of the RTT. The RTT time expired in November last year, that has been disregarded by our leadership and in terms of the constitution of the ANC an interim structure like RTT has a life span of six months and we are here to remind our leadership that time of this interim leadership is over. We are preparing for conference, we are not going to accept that processes of the conference should be managed by the current factional RTT,” says Nkuna. Watch video below:
