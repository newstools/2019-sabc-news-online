Yet another South African Revenue Service (SARS) executive has been suspended. Mmamathe Makheke-Mokhuaneâ€™s suspension brings to five the number of executives currently on precautionary suspension, pending the finalisation of a disciplinary process in respect of serious misconduct allegations. The other four executives are Hlengani Mathebula, Teboho Mokoena, Luther Lebelo and Refiloe Mokoena. In a statement, SARS says this is part of an on-going comprehensive review of the whole leadership. It says the suspensions are precautionary in nature and as such do not amount to findings of any wrong doing. For a related video click below:
