President Cyril Ramaphosa will face questions related to funding for his African National Congress (ANC) presidential campaign when he appears before the National Assembly later on Thursday afternoon. Ramaphosa is due to answer oral questions for the first time since the details of the funding became public. Two questions on the question paper by Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane and his Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) counterpart Julius Malema relate directly to this. In one question, Maimane asks whether, in light of revelations at the State Capture commission and the findings of the Public Protector, Ramaphosa intends to institute a full-scale, independent inquiry to further investigate all allegations of state capture that involve Bosasa. In the very next question, Malema asks the President for the details of the persons in his office and the Cabinet who were involved in fundraising for his campaign and the potential funders whom he met at each of his fundraising dinners. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa had deliberately misled parliament when he said a R500 000 donation from Bosasa was from a business deal his son Andile Ramaphosa had with the company. The President has taken the report on review. WATCH BELOW:
