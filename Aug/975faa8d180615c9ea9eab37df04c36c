Tanzanian President John Magufuli has invited more South African businesses to invest in his country. There are already 208 local businesses set up and operating in Tanzania. Magafuli extended the invitation during the President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s first state visit to Dar Es Salaam on Thursday. Ramaphosa says the good working relationship of the two countries has been fruitful economically, politically and cultural.  He says he would like to see Tanzanian businesses also investing in South African local markets. “During our discussions with President Magufuli we had an opportunity to deliberate on various issues of mutual interest between our two countries. We expressed satisfaction with our strong bilateral relations which are informed by our historical ties. We further agreed that much more can still be done to deepen relations across a number of areas and fields.”  His Excellency President @CyrilRamaphosa arrives for the South Africa-Tanzania Business Forum currently underway at the Julius Nyerere ICC in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. #InvestSA #SAinTanzania#BetterAfricaBetterWorld pic.twitter.com/tMrlCJwOpZ — PresidencyZA (@PresidencyZA) August 15, 2019  The purpose of the South Africa-Tanzania Business Forum is to encourage the private sector from both countries to explore and discuss opportunities for future partnership and investment in different sectors.#InvestSA #SAinTanzania#BetterAfricaBetterWorld pic.twitter.com/ZGCAYNf4NO — PresidencyZA (@PresidencyZA) August 15, 2019
