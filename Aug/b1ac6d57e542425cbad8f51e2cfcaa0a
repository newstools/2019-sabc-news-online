Motorists will have to fork out 11 cents more for a litre of petrol from midnight Tuesday. Diesel will cost 13 cents less per litre and illuminating paraffin 2 cents a litre. The Energy Department has attributed the price adjustments to an increase in oil prices. A prospective petrol station owner Sipho Masombuka says he needs an assurance over the future viability of the retail fuel sector before he can invest. “I’m looking at the carbon emission problem that is experienced currently. At the same time, I am looking at the social group or social organisation that are pushing that everybody must be environmentally friendly and I am looking at the financial injection that the whole world is putting on the new technology, especially looking at the solar cars; and at the same time, vice versa at the petroleum space. If you merge the two you’re looking at the powerhouse of all these entities and the future for petroleum. To me, in the next 50 years, I doubt people will be using cars that are driven by fuel.”
