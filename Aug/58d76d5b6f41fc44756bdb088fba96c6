The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) says it’s concerned about the spread of deadly Candida Auris in the country. Candida Auris is a drug-resistant germ that spreads in hospitals. It can cause bloodstream infections and even lead to death. The NICD says it has completed research in 269 hospitals across South Africa and found infections only in private hospitals in Gauteng. It was first discovered a decade ago, but spread rapidly in different countries including the US and South Africa. Professor Nelesh Govender is from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. “We are concerned. Firstly, because candida Auris has spread rapidly over the last 10 years in SA hospitals. Secondly, candida Auris has a potential to become resistant to multiple classes of anti-fungal medicine. It’s also very difficult to eradicate candida Auris from a hospital because candida Auris can become resistant to disinfectants. We found approximately 6700 cases of candida infection in the blood. There were roughly 800 cases of candida Auris bloodstream infection,” says Govender.
