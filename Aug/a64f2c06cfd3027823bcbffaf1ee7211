Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has urged South Africans to support Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane so she can serve her full term in office. Malema was speaking to the SABC amidst mounting calls for Mkhwebane’s removal following court rulings that have placed her interpretation of the law under scrutiny. Parliament’s Justice Committee has started a process to determine Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. Malema says the future of the Public Protector’s office will be threatened if Mkhwebane is removed. “We need to support her, particularly because if you look at the type of people who are against her, those are the enemies of progress. She’s protecting us. We the people of SA should protect her to finish her term of office. If we remove this woman on the basis of her ruling against our favourites we will never have a Public Protector in SA in the next years to come. We would have closed that office successfully.” WATCH MORE FROM JULIUS MALEMA BELOW:
