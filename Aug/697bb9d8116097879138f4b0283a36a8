The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has refuted allegations by supporters of eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede that the party is plotting to remove her from her position. Gumede is on leave following her arrest in connection with a R208 million Durban solid waste tender. The party decided to extend Gumede’s leave of absence as well as that of Newcastle Mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba who is facing a murder charge. KwaZulu-Natal ANC spokesperson Ricardo Mthembu says the party is protecting its credibility. “We distance ourselves from those allegations. If there are such allegations they need to be proven. We are not only faced with Zandile’s case. And the PEC of the ANC didn’t discuss the Gumede issue.” “It discussed a number of cases and of course agreed that indeed on Sunday we need to finalise all the cases including the comrade Zandile issue. We are not obsessed with Zandile. But we are dealing with the issues because we are a leader of society. And our credibility in the society is important.” Watch related video below…
