The life of Botswana president Mokgweetsi Masisi is in danger. This is according to the country’s Directorate of Intelligence and Security (DIS). Masisi’s official aircraft, en route to Maputo, Mozambique was apparently forced to make a u-turn mid air in June, following intelligence that would-be assassins were waiting in Mozambique. It was later reported last month that Masisi’s aircraft crash landed after one of its engines caught fire in Palapye in Botswana. The DIS’s DG,  Peter Magosi, says they are investigating. “Bagaetsho, it is a fact that the life of our president is in danger. It’s unfortunate, I cannot divulge further than that, but it is a fact. And we won’t take it simple, we take it serious. We are, at this point in time, doing an investigation that will reveal something with regards to that. I’m hamstrung, because it will expose a lot of things in our investigations. But, the bottom line is, yes it is true, his life is in danger, and had we not done what we did at the time, we could have been saying a different story.”
