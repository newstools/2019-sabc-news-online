President Cyril Ramaphosa says his administration has an industrial plan that focuses on generating economic growth in the country. He was speaking during the question and answer session currently on in Parliament. President Ramaphosa says government is also continuing work in stabilising Eskom. He says African trade remains a key area of focus. “There are no easy or quick solutions to low growth and unemployment and this is an important part that we need to be aware of when we introduced the economic recovery and stimulus package. We did say that this was a package with South African characteristics, it was not your typical stimulus project or plan.” Ramaphosa says government is working towards addressing youth unemployment and has set up a specific office in order to look at ways in increasing employment opportunities for the youth. The latest unemployment figures indicate that unemployment has risen to an 11-year high of 29% in the second quarter of 2019. WATCH VIDEO BELOW FOR MORE ON THE STORY:
