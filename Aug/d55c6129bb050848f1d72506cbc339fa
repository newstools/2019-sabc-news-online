Police Minister Bheki Cele has told the community of Mganduzweni and surrounding areas, near Hazyview in Mpumalanga, that unsolved cases that were reported at the Masoyi police station will be revisited. The minister says a Cold Case Unit will be deployed to the station to look into unsolved cases. The minister also promised that the conduct of the police will be investigated and action taken. He went on to warn the community against vigilantism. Cele accompanied by Police Commissioner Khehla Sithole is visiting the area as part of an outreach programme to intensify the awareness about crime. The community complained of high crime in the area that includes murder, particularly against women and children. The community also complained about the shortage of police personnel and resources in the local police stations. Speaking to SABC News, a resident of the area, Esther Mazibuko is still emotional after her niece was found with four other women buried in a yard in the area. A man has since been arrested and will appear in court soon, Mazibuko claims police failed them. Another resident, Bongi Maluka says they want the police to intervene. “As a mother, I don’t feel safe because children are being killed and raped and I want the minister to help us.” “We have a police station, but when you go there they tell you they don’t have cars or more police officers,” laments Thabo Mnisi, a resident. A member of the community Nothando Mokoena stresses that  “This is caused by high level of unemployment in our community and people believe these ritual killings will bring them money.” Cele has warned residents not to take the law into their own hands in retaliation. Residents have burnt suspects and torched their homes. The ministry has promised to build a new police station and increase manpower and resources.
