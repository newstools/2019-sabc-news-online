Lawyers representing convicted murderer Jason Rohde are expected on Friday to apply for leave to appeal the High Court decision in Cape Town to refuse him bail. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe refused to set Rohde free pending the outcome of his appeal against his sentence in the Supreme Court of Appeal. The former property estate executive is serving a 20 year jail term for the murder of his wife, Susan, outside Stellenbosch three years ago. Judge Salie-Hlophe said itâ€™s not in the interest of justice to grant Rohde bail, as it would undermine the administration of justice. The Appeal Court in Bloemfontein last month granted Rohde leave to appeal his sentence and conviction. WATCH BELOW:
