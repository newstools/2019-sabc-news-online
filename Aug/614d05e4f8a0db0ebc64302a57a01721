The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it will appeal Thursday’s judgment by the High Court in Pretoria in favour of President Cyril Ramaphosa. Judge Letty Molopa-Sethosa has ruled that the President made a case to interdict Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s remedial action in the Ivan Pillay pension payout matter. Ramaphosa brought an urgent application against Mkhwebane seeking to suspend the implementation of the remedial action. The President argued against disciplining Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan pending a judicial review. This relates to Mkhwebane’s findings on Gordhan’s approval of former Sars Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay’s early retirement with full pension pay-out in 2010. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyseni Ndlozi says they will appeal the  ruling alongside July’s judgment on the matter by Judge Sulet Potterill. “We obviously disagree with the judgment. The ConCourt said a mere application for a review does not suspend the implementation of the remedial action. Applicants or those upon whom findings have been found by the PP must attain urgent interdicts. But these have to be exceptional circumstances. We disagree and we will be attaching this judgment to the application that we have done to the ConCourt appealing the judgment of Judge Potterill.” Watch video below for more on the story:
