National Planning Commissioner Thami Mazwai says the National Development Plan must be implemented by South Africans and not only government. A reviewed National Development Plan (NDP) is expected to be made available by October 2019. This follows a meeting between President Cyril Ramaphosa and the National Planning Commission on Tuesday. Speaking on Morning Live on Wednesday, Mazwai says the NDP is a common vision of South Africa to eradicate poverty, unemployment and inequality. “All of us South Africans, we’ve got to look to a common future, we’ve got to look to a future free of marginalisation, a future free of poverty, a future that is free of people standing in street corners begging for alms, a future which children are guaranteed a proper education until they go to tertiary education,” he adds.
