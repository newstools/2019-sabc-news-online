Police in the Pretoria CBD have dispersed a group of about 3 000 people in order for fire-fighters to extinguish fires at several businesses. The group of people had barricaded Lilian Ngoyi street. Two fire engines have been extinguishing the blazes while police monitor the situation. Meanwhile, Member of the Mayoral Committee for Roads and Transport in the Tshwane Metro Sheila Lynn Senkubuge says she will meet stakeholders in the taxi industry later on Wednesday in a bid to resolve the chaotic situation in the CBD. On Tuesday traffic in some parts of the Pretoria CBD came to a standstill when a taxi driver was shot dead by a suspected drug peddler. Traffic remains congested on several streets and many shops are closed. Senkubuge says she hopes a solution will soon be found. “The first thing, we are, as the city, definitely have to apologise to our commuters. First of all to everyone who has to find alternative transport today and for the sheer inconvenience where no one is able to get to where they need to go during the day. We are really are sorry. But can commit that as a city we are working hard to resolve the situation and talk with the taxi industry. We will be having a meeting later today and law enforcement is doing everything they can to resolve this.”
