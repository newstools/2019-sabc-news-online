The Hawks say they will contact the Public Protector for questioning once they have received the docket and their preliminary investigations have been completed after charges were filed against her by Accountability Now. The Group’s Director, Paul Hoffman has accused Busisiwe Mkhwebane of perjury and defeating the ends of justice. The matter relates to a finding against Mkhwebane by the Constitutional Court regarding the ABSA-Reserve Bank issue. Accountability Now also wants Mkhwebane struck off advocates roll. Hawks Spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says, “There is a docket that has been opened against the Public Protector; that docket is still in transit to the head office. We will be sending a serious corruption investigating team to look into the matter. It’s still early stage. Based on the statement that we will receive then there will be a determination as to whether we should get any statements or affidavits from the PP.” Hoffman says Accountability Now has also written to the Legal Practice Council to strike her off the advocates roll following the cost order against her. “The Constitutional Court made a very clear finding of dishonesty, bad faith, an attempt to mislead the court and falsehoods under oath in effect. Although the judgement is in the language of a civil case, the facts that the court has found amount, in our view, to the elements of the charges of perjury and defeating the ends of the justice that we have raised.”
