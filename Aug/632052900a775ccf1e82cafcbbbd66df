The 16 African National Congress (ANC) councillors who have been expelled from the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in Qwaqwa in the Free State are expected to officially announce their resignation from the party. The PEC dismissed the councillors from the ANC last year. This, after they allegedly voted with the opposition parties in a motion of no confidence to remove former mayor Vusi Tshabalala. Spokesperson for the dismissed councillors, Paratlane Motloung, says they will hold a symbolic meeting in which they will take off their ANC T-shirts and declare the axed councillors as independent candidates that will contest the much-anticipated August 28 by-elections. “What we will be doing symbolically will be showing that we are distancing ourselves or leaving the ANC since we have been members of the ANC for so long it will be a show that now that the ANC really no longer need us. We will be leaving the ANC so that there will be a symbolic gesture at the meeting.” Click on the related video below:
