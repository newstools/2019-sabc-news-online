The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) on Monday announced that it will file an application at the Labour Court on Tuesday, seeking to have irregular appointments within the Corporation declared unlawful, invalid and set aside. These are appointments that are deemed to have been effected without following relevant SABC policies. The application follows recommendations of the reports of the Public Protector and the Parliamentary Ad Hoc Committee, as well as the SABC’s internal investigation on irregular appointments. So far, 28 cases have been identified for the first phase of the process. The ongoing investigation might reveal further irregular appointments. All affected parties will be afforded an opportunity to oppose the application.  Earlier this month,  the chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into Editorial Interference at the SABC Joe Thloloe recommended that the public broadcaster should conduct an audit of the appointment and promotions of senior news management. Thloloe also found that between 2012 and 2017 SABC executives took instructions from people without authority in the newsroom.
