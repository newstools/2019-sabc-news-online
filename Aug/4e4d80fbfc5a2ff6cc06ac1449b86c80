The City of Johannesburg will be holding sod-turning ceremonies on Wednesday for the first four of 84 properties earmarked for redevelopment. The properties represent part of a R22 billion investment in the inner-city which is expected to generate 11000 direct construction sector jobs.  The inner-city revitalisation project is expected to yield approximately 6 500 units of affordable housing with rentals beginning from R900 per month. Jo’burg Mayor Herman Mashaba says the inner-city will be officially turned into a construction site. “Today is honestly another historic day for the City of Johannesburg, if not South Africa. First of December 2016, I made a huge pronouncement that I want to turn the inner city into a construction site to provide affordable housing for our people, our students and SMMEs. So today we are now doing the sod turning of the four of the 84 awarded contracts.”
