The Limpopo Health Department says a nurse who was shot and wounded by a patient earlier Friday evening, is recuperating well. The patient allegedly shot and wounded the nurse at the Polokwane Provincial Hospital, before turning the gun on himself. Health spokesperson Neil Shikwambana,”He’s stable, he’s OK. I was talking to the surgeons now they are busy with all other tests but unfortunately the patient took his life. When you look this is a patient who is being referred from our per referral hospitals. They come through our planned patient transport. When such vehicles come at the gate we usually do not search them, we are told its a legal gun. The police are busy with the work that they are doing. ”
