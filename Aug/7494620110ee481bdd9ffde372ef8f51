Maree says the business and project plans relating to the Gupta linked Estina Farm Project in Vrede were haphazard, hurried and not done by someone who was familiar with the dairy industry The agricultural economist made a second appearance before the commission after its two-week break. Maree told the Commission that there was no need for government to fund the Estina project. He told the commission that the feasibility study was prematurely done and the business project was unrealistic. Maree says the feasibility study was more a document on farming than feasibility. Earlier the inquiry heard evidence from the former Deputy Director General of the Free State Treasury – Anne Fourie, detailing how she was pressured to assist in one of the payments amounting to millions by the then provincial Agriculture CFO Seipati Dlamini.
