Yet another former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) interim board member, Krish Naidoo, has disputed the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) report on the SABC security tender. Naidoo says the report is fatally flawed and filled with various factual errors. Earlier, former acting Group CEO at the time, Tseliso Ralitabo also maintained that there was no wrongdoing in the awarding of the R185 million security tender to Mafoko Security in 2017. Mafoko’s competitor, MJAYELI is reported to have been a bidder scoring high in pricing, but the Board overruled its own supply chain processes and awarded the contract to Mafoko. Naidoo says there is something fishy about this report. “What is a matter of serious concern is the way this report is being treated and the only person that can see an SIU report is the President. As far as I understand this report has never been made public by the President, so how it got to the public space, somebody either at the SABC or at the SIU needs to explain. The question I’m asking myself is there an ulterior motive here, and if there is those of us that are fighting, standing for good governance must deal with that and root out this rogue elements that are dealing with this report in the manner that it has been dealt with,” says Naidoo.
