The Speaker of the Ukhahlamba Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal has survived an assassination attempt. Sthembiso Zulu was shot 11 times on Tuesday night. The KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC,  Sipho Hlomuka has urged police to work around the clock to find for Zulu’s attackers. Hlomuka says, “It is painful to hear that Councillor Sthembiso Zulu was attacked. The report that we received is that he was shot 11 times when he was coming from work on his way home. We are still requesting the police to do an investigation on the matter. We hope that police are going to deal with the matter urgently.” The shooting followed only four days after an Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) councillor at Inkosi Langalibalele Municipality, Mthembeni Majola, was shot and killed in a hit in Estcourt. Details about the shooting are still sketchy, but it is believed that Majola was travelling with two occupants in his car when they were attacked by unknown men. Majola is said to have died on the scene while the other two were rushed to hospital. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala says charges of murder and attempted murder are being investigated by Estcourt police. –Additional reporting by Nonjabula Mntungwa. Watch related video below:
