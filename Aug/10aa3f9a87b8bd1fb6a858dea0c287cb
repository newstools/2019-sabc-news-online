Lawyers representing two Coligny men in the North West, convicted of killing 16-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu, in an incident that sparked racial clashes, say they will this week file papers to overturn both the conviction and sentence. This after the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein granted the two men leave to appeal. Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, who are currently serving 18 and 23 years respectively, were found guilty of murdering Mosweu, by throwing him from a moving bakkie. Civic Rights Group AfriForum’s CEO Kallie Kriel, on behalf of the convicted men, says their lawyers are preparing papers for an urgent bail application pending the appeal. Kriel says the States only witness in the case, Bonakele Pakisi, was dishonest and they have evidence to this effect. Pakisi testified that he saw the two men killing Mosweu. They then abducted him at gunpoint, saying he must not tell anybody what he saw.
