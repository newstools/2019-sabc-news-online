The community of Vlakfontein south of Johannesburg is protesting outside the Protea Magistrates’ Court in Soweto as a 28-year-old man arrested for the murder of his 41-year-old girlfriend appears in court. The suspect allegedly buried the girlfriend’s body in a shallow grave inside a shack. The victim was reported missing in June. The boyfriend allegedly confessed to the murder and led police to the spot where the girlfriend’s body was buried. Last year, seven bodies of the Khoza family were found buried under a heap of sand inside a house also in Vlakfontein. The disgruntled Vlakfontein community is chanting struggle songs ahead of the start of the court case. They are holding placards written “Enough with murders in Vlakfontein” and others saying “No bail, life sentence”. Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko, is also present and has told SABC News that the suspect allegedly confessed to there being more bodies. However police could not confirm this.
