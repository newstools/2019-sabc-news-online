The Mpumalanga Health Department has opened a new Oncology unit at the Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela. The unit has already begun the treatment of cancer patients. Previously, cancer patients had to travel to Gauteng to seek treatment because the province did not provide such services. Cancer patients will now have access to services such as chemotherapy, closer to home.  Thirty-one-year old Sibongile Hlophe (not a real name) was diagnosed with Kaposi Sarcoma cancer in February.  This type of cancer forms masses in the skin. She is the first recipient of the chemotherapy at the Rob Fereira Oncology Unit and is excited that she will be receiving treatment closer to home. “I don’t have to travel to long distances and being one of the first is the best. I feel very comfortable.” Government is on a drive to improve service delivery in healthcare facilities. Recently, the Human Rights Commission raised a concern about the state of healthcare facilities in the province. Health MEC, Sasekani Manzini says the launch of the Oncology unit will assist many patients. “From time to time, we are going to assess where are the gaps, because you must understand that when you are starting a new service, there will be some gaps and challenges. But those challenges to us, they will be opportunities to say, ‘where (do) we need to improve?'” For years, cancer patients had to travel to Gauteng for the services. A medical doctor from the Rob Fereira Hospital, Nokwande Zuma, says the unit will make their job a lot easier. “Each patient diagnosed either stayed at home or was transferred to Steve Biko Hospital to get treatment and after that, they’d get lost in the system. We offer chemotherapy.” The provincial healthcare services is still under-resourced but the Department plans open another Oncology unit in Witbank.
