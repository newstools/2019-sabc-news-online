Former MEC for Economic Development in the Free State, Mxolisi Dukwana has told the State Capture Inquiry that as senior officials they failed the people in the province. Dukwana has detailed to the commission how tenders in the Free State were awarded because of patronage. The former MEC was giving testimony at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Making his second appearance before the commission, Dukwana has detailed what was happening in the Free State under Ace Magashule as premier. The once defender and supporter of the now ANC SG says patronage was the order of the day in the province. He says they failed the province by not reporting corrupt conduct in the Free State. Dukwana says his testimony at the commission is in response to a call made by the ANC Nasrec conference, to be of assistance to the Commission, not because he personally hates Magashule. Meanwhile, calls for those who might have any information were reiterated. Earlier, the commission’s legal team and lawyers of people implicated in Dukwana’s testimony spent time arguing over the naming of one of those implicated. The issue of concern has been of lawyer Mike Hellen’s client – the mysterious Mr X – who wants to remain anonymous. The commission will resume on Wednesday when Dukwana will testify about the Free State asbestos heist. Click video below:
