The Democratic Alliance (DA) has requested National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise to alert Parliament to the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land’s warning that the proposed amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation would be inherently unconstitutional. The panel released its final report on Sunday in which it detailed the circumstances in which expropriation without compensation could be applied. DA MP, Glynnis Breytenbach says the party believes that the Section 25 amendment will condemn the country’s economy to inevitable collapse. She says the DA wrote a letter to the Speaker in which they request a discussion of sections of the final report and that it must be read into the record of the Ad Hoc Committee on Land.
