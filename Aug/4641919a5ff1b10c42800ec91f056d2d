ANC provincial secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Mdumiseni Ntuli, has confirmed they have received embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede’s resignation withdrawal letter. Gumede tendered her resignation on Monday in accordance with the instruction of the provincial ANC that their office bearers in Durban and Pietermaritzburg resign. The party’s provincial leadership decided to redeploy them citing poor service delivery. It is understood that Gumede wants to plead her case with the ANC’s top six at national level. Ntuli says they will engage with her and persuade her to do the right thing by sticking to her resignation. He says: “The first thing would be to engage with her to say this is not the right direction to take.” “By the way this is a comrade who is just a Mayor. The ANC has recalled Premiers and Presidents and and it has not found it to be an impossible task.  The Mayor would be persuaded as a member of the ANC, she will understand that there are far reaching consequences.” Related Video Below…   Meanwhile, the ANC has lambasted Gumede’s actions to withdraw her resignation from office. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says this is an act of defiance and its unheard of in the history of the movement. He says, “The issue is whether such an action is permissible in terms of the rules of engagement in the ANC and certainly no, it would be an act of defiance.” “Once the provincial executive committee has taken a decision to withdraw its deployees from performing certain responsibilities and accordingly went out to advice them, conveyed its position to the public and ultimately accepted by those deployees at that point a decision is understood to have been taken.” Related Video
