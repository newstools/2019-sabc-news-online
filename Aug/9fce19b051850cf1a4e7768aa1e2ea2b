City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says the city is doing so well financially that he might consider freezing tariff increases next year. He has also declared the billing crisis over. This is despite thousands of people still struggling to make head or tail of their electricity and water bills. Some Johannesburg residents are complaining that they got two different bills last month while others are complaining about the spike in their water and electricity bills. Mayor Mashaba visited a town hall in Kibbler Park, south of Johannesburg, where the City had set up camp to help residents with billing queries. He says as far as billing queries are concerned, he has over delivered and he is really proud that the city’s finances are getting better by the day. “The success of what we are doing will allow us as a city to generate more funds that by the time I present a budget I will present a budget without any increases except for electricity and water because we buy from Eskom and Rand Water, so we will only pass increases on those,” says Mashaba.
