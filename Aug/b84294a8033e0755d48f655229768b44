Cabinet has approved the publication of the Consumer Housing Protection Bill. The bill regulates home builders and introduces enforcement tools. It also creates an enabling environment for new entrants into the home building sector by introducing contractual provisions that ensure their sustainability in the market. Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, announced the publication of the Bill at a Post Cabinet briefing in Parliament. “Cabinet approved for the publication of the Consumer Housing Protection Bill of 2019 in the government gazette for public comments. The bill repeals the current measures act of 1998. The new legal framework will regulate home builders and developers, expand the protection to consumers, introduce effective enforcement tools and prescribe appropriate penalty sanctions to deter non-compliance by home builders. Subsidy and social housing projects now fall with the bill to ensure the protection of consumers in the housing market.” WATCH POST CABINET BRIEFING BELOW:
