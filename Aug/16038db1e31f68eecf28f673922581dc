Another cold front with heavy rain and strong wind is expected to make landfall in Cape Town by midday on Wednesday. Forecaster, Henning Grobler, says Capetonians can expect cold temperatures over the next few days, with another well-developed front reaching the Mother City by Sunday evening. “We’re in for a cloudy and rainy day most parts of tomorrow, that cold front will move eastwards on Thursday extending all along the south coast with light rain and showers. Then also on Thursday on and off showers after the cold front into Thursday evening, by Friday another weak cold front just brushing south of Cape Town with another cold front setting in by Sunday evening with rain and showers,” says Grobler.
