The African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee in KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed that it has redeployed the entire eThekwini and Umsunduzi executive committee members. This means that eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede among others have effectively been axed from their positions. The announcement was made at a media conference in Durban. The party says it has decided to redeploy the executive of both the eThekwini Metro and Umsunduzi municipality. ANC Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says Gumede and others will be replaced within the next seven days. “The PEC also decided that all ANC members who are serving as EXCO members of eThekwini and uMsunuduzi local municipalities respectively should with immediate effect be redeployed. We are convinced that the absence of change in the leadership in some of these municipalities is certainly a prescription of inability and if it remains unattended, it will punish the confidence and the image of the ANC.”
