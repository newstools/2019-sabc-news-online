The Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA) says it expects the balance of cash owed to it by SA Express on Monday. ACSA says it has lifted the suspension imposed on the cash-strapped airline after SA Express made a partial payment towards settling its debt. The airline was grounded after failing to pay its R70 million debt to ACSA, which suspended the state-owned airline from operating on its runways. It is not clear how much of the debt SA Express has paid to ACSA. Meanwhile, SA Express has apologised to its customers the cancellation of flights earlier this week.
