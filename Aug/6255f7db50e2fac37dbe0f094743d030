Outgoing eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede says she’s determined to clear her name after being removed from the powerful post this week. Gumede learned of her fate on Tuesday following the decision by the African National Congress’ KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Executive Committee to remove her from the position. She says she is seeking legal advice on the ANC’s decision and will make a statement on the matter soon. The ANC has fired Gumede and the uMsunduzi Municipal Mayor Themba Njilo, citing a lack of service delivery.
