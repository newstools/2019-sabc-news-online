A man who has allegedly confessed to killing his girlfriend and burying her body in a shallow grave inside a shack in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, is expected to appear in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto on Tuesday morning. The 28-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday after he voluntarily pointed the police to a spot under the bed where his 41-year-old girlfriend’s body had been buried. The deceased had been missing for two months. Last year seven bodies of the Khoza family were found buried under a heap of sand inside a house also in Vlakfontein. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko says communities need to lookout for each other. “As communities we need to know about the whereabouts of each other. If you notice that so and so has not been seen in a long time. But most of all be aware. I mean this guy lived next to another shack but the neighbours claim they heard nothing.  So we wish to call upon our communities, they must be on the lookout.”
