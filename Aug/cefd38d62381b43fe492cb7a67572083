The chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into Editorial Interference at the SABC Joe Thloloe has recommended that the public broadcaster should conduct an audit of the appointment and promotions of senior news management. Thloloe says the audit should focus particularly on Nothando Maseko and Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane who has since resigned as well as Charles Matlou. Thloloe released the report at the public broadcaster’s offices Auckland Park offices. He also found that between 2012 and 2017 SABC executives took instructions from people without authority in the newsroom. Thloloe says they found that Ditlhakanyane, Maseko and Nyana Molete were pivotal in the execution of instructions from the former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng, among other executives. “Motsoeneng’s instruction to Human Resources to institute disciplinary hearings against employers, dismiss, promote or appoint others must be reviewed. Also Human Resources should do an audit of the appointments, promotions or sideways shifts of senior management.” Click video below:
