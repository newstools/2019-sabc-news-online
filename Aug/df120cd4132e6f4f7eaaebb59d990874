The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will continue in Parktown in Johannesburg on Tuesday morning with evidence from the former head of the Free State Agriculture Department Peter Thabethe. Several witnesses have implicated Thabethe in corruption in the Estina dairy farm project which was aimed at benefiting local farmers. He was arrested on charges of fraud and corruption with seven other individuals. However, charges were later provisionally withdrawn. Last week Thabethe told the commission that his department paid for the former Free State premier, Ace Magashule’s advisor, Ashok Narayan’s trip to India, even though he was not an official.
