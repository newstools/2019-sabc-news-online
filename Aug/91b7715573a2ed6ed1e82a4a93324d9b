Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says, “As the police, we are investigating a case of murder after a 45-year old man was shot and killed. It is reported the taxi drivers who operate within the Blood Taxi Rank were chasing the alleged drug addicts that usually hang around in the area.” “During the chase, someone fired a shot that struck one of the taxi drivers who died on the scene.
