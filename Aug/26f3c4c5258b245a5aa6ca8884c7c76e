The City of Tshwane and its City Manager Moeketsi Mosola have finally parted ways following a council resolution. Mosola has been municipal manager since March 2017. The office of the Executive mayor has described Mosola’s departure as an amicable parting of ways. There were claims Mosola had been offered a R7 million golden handshake. Omogolo Taunyane speaks for the office of the mayor. “There’s no golden handshake that’s been paid to Dr Mosola. What he’s being paid is the remainder of his contract that is two and half years that currently remain. So that is what the city is paying him as a cost to company,” says Taunyane.
