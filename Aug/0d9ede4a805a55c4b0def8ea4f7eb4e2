Pan Africanist Congress of Azania Acting President, Mzwanele Nyhontso, says the party will come out united from the two day national elective conference being held in Bloemfontein. The faction led by Nyhontso, who is also a member of Parliament, is expected to elect new leadership. Another faction held its congress in Limpopo last weekend where Narius Moloto was elected as the President. The PAC leadership contest has been a subject of several court battles. Nyhontso says the court has ordered them to elect the new leadership. “This is the moment that we have agreed upon on the 8th of March as directed by Justice Judge Mavundla that on this day the PAC must hold a united congress and elect one leadership and have one PAC and that has been achieved. And we are hoping that from this conference we are going to achieve the unity because it is paramount and we hoping that going forward there will never be a question especially from SABC that says how many PACs. There will always be one PAC because remember we are the law abiding citizens.”
