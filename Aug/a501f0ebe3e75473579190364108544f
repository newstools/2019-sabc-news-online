The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will consult its coalition partners, including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to save its Johannesburg Mayor from being ousted from office. The Johannesburg African National Congress (ANC) has indicated it will table a motion of confidence against Herman Mashaba in two weeks’ time. In a statement released on Tuesday, the ANC has confirmed that its request for the motion has been accepted by the Programming Committee and will be tabled on the 22 August. The party accuses Mashaba of bringing the Metro into a financial crisis. DA Spokesperson Solly Malatsi says they will be engaging with all coalition partners, even the EFF. “As with every coalition government, we always speak to different coalition partners and parties that would help form those governments. So, you will anticipate that discussions will be ongoing with the different political parties. All these coalition partners, including the EFF and the other coalition partners, it will be fair to engage with them.”
