The former deputy director of Public Prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba will on Wednesday continue her fight for reinstatement. This time she will take on Members of Parliament in the High Court in Cape Town. Parliament’s Justice Portfolio Committee was meant to discuss written presentations from Jiba and the former special director of prosecutions Lawrence Mrwebi, on why they should not be removed from their respective positions. But, Parliamentary legal advisor Siviwe Njikela told MPs that Jiba had launched an urgent court application to interdict Parliament from continuing with its process to determine whether she should be reinstated or not. MPs agreed to halt the process pending the outcome of Wednesday’s urgent application. President Cyril Ramaphosa fired Jiba and Mrwebi in April this year. The move was on the basis of the Mokgoro Inquiry report which found that they were not fit to hold office and had compromised the integrity of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).
