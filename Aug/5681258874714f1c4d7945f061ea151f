The State Capture Commission resumes in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday. It will be hearing testimony of the former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana. During his last appearance before the commission, Dukwana said he was fired by the province’s former premier Ace Magashule because he turned down attempts to get him to participate in Magashule’s alleged dodgy dealings with the Gupta family. On Tuesday he is expected to shed some light on how he was forced into committing acts that were against the Public Finance Management Act. Dukwana testified at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry revealing how Rajesh Gupta allegedly offered him R2 million a month to help the Guptas get a multi-billion rand construction tender. He is expected to expand on this and other incidents that led him to be fired by the former premier Ace Magashule. After his testimony two more witnesses are scheduled to testify.
