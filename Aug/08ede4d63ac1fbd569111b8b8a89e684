Law enforcement officials have confiscated a large number of counterfeit goods at the China Mall, in Boksburg on Gautengâ€™s East Rand. The multi-disciplinary operation was led by a tip-off that the mall is selling counterfeit goods. The items will also be checked to see if they entered the country legally. Just two weeks ago, officials conducted a raid in the Johannesburg city centre that saw a mountain of counterfeit goods seized and hundreds of people arrested. They were believed to be in the country illegally. Ten police officials were also arrested for allegedly attempting to re-sell the confiscated goods.
