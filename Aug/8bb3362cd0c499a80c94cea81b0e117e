African National Congress (ANC) chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal Sihle Zikalala says party deployees should never defy the decisions of leadership structures. Zikalala says such behaviour goes against the rules of the party.  He was delivering the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela memorial lecture in Hluhluwe in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. This as the party in the province finds itself in an unattainable position with eThekwini Metro Mayor Zandile Gumede defying it’s PEC decision for her to step down. Earlier this week, Gumede withdrew her resignation letter from being a mayor after the party in the province instructed her to resign. ANC members converged in Hluhluwe to draw lessons from the life of the Madikizela-Mandela. They hailed her as an exemplary leader who was committed to the fight for equality. Meanwhile, the provincial leadership of the party is expected to meet with national officials to discuss deployment issues in the province.
