Treasury has granted embattled arms company, DENEL, a R1.8 billion bailout. DENEL says in a statement that governmentâ€™s decision to recapitalise the firm will help create a sustainable asset for South Africa. CEO, Danie du Toit, says the cash is being made available because of progress in restructuring the business, among other things. The company has been battling to pay its workers on time and has joined a long line of parastatals that have battled to stay viable.

He says DENEL is moving towards disposing of non core assets as requested by government.  Read the statement below:
