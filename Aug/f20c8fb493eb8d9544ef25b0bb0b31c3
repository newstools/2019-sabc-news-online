Civil organisation, Right2Know, has sought to explain its reasons for bringing an application to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria – to review and set aside the findings of the Seriti Commission of Inquiry into the controversial arms deal. Corruption Watch and Right2Know (R2K) have argued that Judge Willie Seriti’s 2016 findings misled the public by exonerating politicians and public servants in wrongdoing during the arms deal saga. Judgment in the application will be handed down at the High Court on Wednesday morning. R2K national deputy co-ordinator, Ghalib Galant, says they believe the commission was selective in choosing who would testify or present evidence. “Our challenge is essentially a procedural one, with how Judge Seriti handled the commission. The outcome, which exonerated those politicians, found no wrongdoing and it should be set aside. When witnesses were called before it, there were some that weren’t even asked a single question by the commission and the judge. It looked to us like the commission was very selective in what it chose to allow it and also who it excluded from testifying or presenting evidence,” explains Galant. Click below for related video….
