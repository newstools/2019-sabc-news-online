Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, says they are working with the Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to resolve issues surrounding the quality of water in the municipality. This after residents of Hammanskraal complained about the quality of the water supplied. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has also found that water in the area is contaminated and not suitable for human consumption. The SAHRC in Gauteng will be holding a public inquiry into the status of the water – after inspecting the water quality at Roodeplaat Dam in Pretoria on Sunday. Mokgalapa says they are working on finding an amicable solution. “We are engaging with the SAHRC. If all goes well I have planned a meeting with them for tomorrow. We have met with the department of water and we are working on finding an amicable solution. We have upgraded the waste treatment plant which I am unveiling this Friday. We have done a tender as well. So we can do more but it is not a political stance, it is about the human rights of people.”
