New figures from Statistics South Africa show a decline in free basic services, as more services are being extended to homes across the country. The data was revealed in the non-financial census document for municipalities. Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke says indigent households identified by municipalities between 2017 – 2018 amounted to about 3.6 million in the country. Maluleke says the figures show that the levels of affordability are improving. “One of the things we are observing is that there is a general decline in all the free basic services, which is an indication that we have people moving out of that core of basic services. As people move out means there are more free basic services, it means the levels of affordability are improving.” He adds: “On the other hand there are issues in relation to indigents – the number has increased, but because people are more poorer, but because municipalities have been calling on people to come and register for free basic services. So those services have declined.” Watch below: Maluleke speaks about the new economic policy paper:
