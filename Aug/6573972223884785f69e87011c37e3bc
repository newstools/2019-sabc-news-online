Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape has confirmed that workers have returned to work. An agreement was reached to pay a 6.5% salary hike, and an additional 2.5% notch progression. The two week-strike adversely affected people in six local municipalities. Striking workers allegedly also closed the valves to water supplies. This raised tensions at Alice in Raymond Mhlaba municipality and Butterworth in the Mnquma municipality. Municipal spokesperson Nonceba Makikizela-Vuso says they are trying to restore water supply in the affected areas. “Right now everyone is back at their work stations and we have managed to restore supply in certain areas however other areas are still without water because of damaged valves. We are fixing them so that we can restore the supply.”
