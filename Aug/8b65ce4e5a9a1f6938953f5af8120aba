Traditional healers observed the national traditional medicine day in Pretoria on Saturday. They say they should work alongside western health practitioners in hospitals. In 2000 World Health Organsation (WHO) adopted a resolution to promote the use of indigenous medicinal plants and now many continue to remember this important resolution. “It is important because our people used it in the past as there were no pills. So people should commemorate this day because our ancestors relied on these traditional medicine and it works,” says  traditional healer, Baba Mswazi. Themba Tyatyaza, is a traditional healer from Soshanguve. He has lambasted western medical practitioners and pharmacists for taking traditional medicine and making it their own. He believes that traditional medicine can compliment western medicine. According to WHO, 80% of Africans rely on traditional medicine. For more watch video below:
