As Women’s Month wraps up new activist groups have sprung into action to speak out against gender-based violence. In the north of Johannesburg, the SA Women Fight Back movement held a silent protest for those lost to femicide. Three women die at the hands of their intimate partners daily. That is a shocking statistic that has sparked these women into action. They held a silent vigil to mourn what they’ve called, the fallen angels. Taariya Reddy an activist says: “Since the movement began at the beginning of August – we have heard of deaths every other day of woman and children so we wanted to create awareness.” Mandy Pienaar of SA Women Fight Back says: “We decided to hold a vigil for the thousands of women who have been raped, murdered and abused. We are their voice because they have been silenced permanently.”
