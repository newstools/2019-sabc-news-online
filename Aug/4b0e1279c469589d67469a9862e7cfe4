A war of words has erupted between City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and the African National Congress (ANC) in council. The ANC claimed that it had received a report on which the Democratic Alliance (DA) Mayor had based his allegations of ANC corruption. Mashaba is on record saying that he has uncovered billions of fraudulent transactions by the former ANC government in the City. However, the ANC says the actual report contains no such evidence. The ANC released a report on which it claims Mashaba bases his allegations. The report lists large sums of money alongside some entities and departments belonging to the City. Another report is more detailed; outlining unauthorised, irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure and other transgressions with the amounts alongside. The ANC says these reports present no evidence of corruption. Regional secretary Dada Morero says the report, which they also gave to the media, shows that Mashaba has been bluffing. “Finally after three years of fighting for the report, we have now received what they call report on R33 billion looting of the ANC. In fact, what the report suggests is the R33 billion will actually scare you that Mashaba has just been dreaming of something or has some imaginary illusions.” Mashaba says he stands by his allegations that he has uncovered ANC corruption in the City to the tune of R33 billion. His spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka says the allegations are solid. “The reality is that the multiparty government’s fight against corruption has achieved over 5000 cases which have been reported and are under investigation totalling an estimated amount of R33 billion. In these investigations, five members of the ANC’s former mayoral committee have been identified and implicated in wrongdoing, including the current and former regional chairperson of the ANC within Johannesburg.”
