A number of roads have been closed across Cape Town due to protest action. Protesters have started burning tyres in the roadways since early on Thursday morning. This comes after the Shutdown Movement in Cape Town warned of a mass protest on Thursday against a lack of housing opportunities. The Stellenbosch Arterial Road has been closed to traffic in both directions between Adam Tas and the Delft main roads due to the protest action. It is unclear if this particular group is part of the Shutdown Movement. Protesters have also closed Voortrekker Road near Kensington in both directions at 4th Avenue. The Shutdown Movement has promised to barricade more major intersections on Thursday morning during peak time traffic to highlight housing shortages in their areas.
