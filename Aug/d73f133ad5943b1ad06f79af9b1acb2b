Police Minister, Bheki Cele, is among those paying their last respects to Sam Meyiwa, the father of slain football star Senzo Meyiwa. The funeral service is currently underway in Umlazi, south of Durban. The 67-year-old died last week following a long illness. Before his death Meyiwa made an impassioned plea to police to find his sonâ€™s killers. Senzo was killed in 2014 during a botched robbery at a house in Vosloorus in Johannesburg.
