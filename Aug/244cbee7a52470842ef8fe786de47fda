The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture continues hearing former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana’s evidence on Wednesday morning in Parktown, Johannesburg. Dukwana, who is appearing for the second time, told the commission that a system of patronage and intimidation has created a culture of fear in the Free State province. Dukwana was fired as MEC by then former premier Ace Magashule in 2012.
