The Human Rights Commission (HRC) in the Western Cape will host a housing summit in the next two weeks. This follows a number of protests across Cape Town where groups of residents under the banner of the ShutDown Movement barricaded roads during peak hour traffic to demand housing. Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Nissen, says backyard dwellers will be addressed by the relevant government departments during the summit. “Last year, we dealt with a lot of issues around backyarders particularly in Parkwood and there were many promises made and none of those promises have come to fruition. I understand that the Western Cape Government is looking into some of these. However, this backyard problem is a problem across the Cape Flats; across the metro; and across the Western Cape; perhaps even nationally. So, that’s why we thought it’s very important that we bring all roleplayers together.”      Click on the videos below:
