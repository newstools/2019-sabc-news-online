An independent political analyst Solly Masilela says the latest developments in the African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga confirm the long-held notion that the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) has collapsed. He says the fact that the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) resolved to suspend senior regional leaders further demonstrates the non-existence of the PEC. “The Provincial Executive Committee, as alleged by some other members of the ANC, has totally collapsed. Hence the matter is now being handled by the office bearers, particularly, the secretary for that matter. It then indicated those who are alleging that PEC was no longer functional are having a point. But secondly, it is totally against the constitution of the ANC, because you will remember, in terms of the ANC constitution, the highest authority in the province is the PEC,” says Masilela. Two senior ANC members in Mpumalanga have been served with letters of suspension. This, follows skirmishes in which the party’s acting provincial secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali was allegedly assaulted three weeks ago. There’s speculation that the suspended ANC members are the chairperson of the now disbanded Ehlanzeni region Ngrayi Ngwenya and Acting Treasurer Phindile Nkuna. Ngwenya and Nkuna allegedly assaulted Ntshalintshali during the announcement of the disbandment of the region. The matter was reported to the police. Ntshalintshali says the party is dealing with the issue. “It’s an NEC decision. The SGO is the one that deals with that. Remember we have our own organisational protocols, in terms of how we communicate. What I can confirm is that those members have been served; they know the decision of the NEC now, but members are aware and they’ve got processes that are outlined in terms of responding within a certain period surround those incidences.”
