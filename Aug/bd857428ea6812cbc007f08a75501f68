The triple murder case against the accused truck driver, Colin Pillay, from Phoenix, north of Durban is expected to resume in the High Court in Durban on Friday morning. Pillay is accused of killing his married lover, Jane Govindasamy, and her two young daughters in their flat in Phoenix north of Durban in September last year. State prosecutor advocate Cheryl Naidu and defence advocate Amanda Hulley are expected to announce a date for the heads of argument to be heard. Earlier this week, the court was shown video footage, of the accused allegedly leaving the home of the victims, hours after the murders were committed, holding what advocate Naidu described, as a knife.
