An explosion damaged a police station in Copenhagen early on Saturday, in the second blast to hit the Danish capital in four days. No one was injured in the blast, which happened outside a station in the Norrebro, just outside the city centre, police said on Twitter. On Tuesday, one person was slightly injured in an explosion outside the Danish Tax Agencyâ€™s office, in what police said was a deliberate attack. Police told Reuters it was too early to say whether the two blasts were connected, but could not immediately comment further. Police were searching for a man running from the scene of the blast, Ekstra Bladet said. Serious attacks or violence are rare in the small Nordic country of 5.7 million people that prides itself on a reputation for safety and social tolerance.
