The African National Congress (ANC) deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte says the party now has a policy in place to manage the behaviour of party leaders on social media. There have been some public spats particularly on Twitter between ANC leaders over the party’s internal matters. Duarte maintains that the party is united, even though its leaders have strong difference on particular matters. She says the implementation of the policy has managed to curb these public disagreements. “We have raised concerns about people who are arguing with each other about internal ANC matters in a platform like Twitter. What the ANC does, we now have a policy. But you have noticed that the finance minister isn’t doing that, Fikile Mbalula certainly isn’t doing that even some younger people, we call them.” The last few months have seen a set of developments leading some to think that governing party is divided and that there are attempts to sabotage or weaken its leadership. Duarte speaks to  Stephen Grootes on a series of events within the ANC.  There are of course other issues, the emails that show who donated money to Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign, or the decision this week to remove Zandile Gumede as mayor of eThekwini.
