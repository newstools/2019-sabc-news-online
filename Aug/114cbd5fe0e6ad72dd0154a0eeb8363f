The Human Rights Commission says the settlement agreement it reached with businessman Adam Catzavelos will act as a deterrent but also ensure there’s restorative justice. Catzavelos has agreed to donate R150 000 to the Seth Mazibuko Foundation in Soweto. He is also expected to issue a public apology. The Human Rights Commission brought the application in the Equality court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate’s court in Johannesburg after a self-recorded video of Catzavelos emerged in which he allegedly utters the K-word while on holiday in Greece in August last year. The settlement agreement is yet to be officially made an order of the court. The Commission’s Buang Jones says Catzavelos will also be required to do 160 hours of community service which will be spread over six months. “Mr. Catzavelos is expected to visit Soweto where this community service will be performed and he will be working with the Foundation in their endeavour to embed a culture of human rights in Soweto and to also allow him to work with diverse community and we hope that through this endeavour we would have achieved our objectives to contribute to nation-building.” Click on the videos below:
