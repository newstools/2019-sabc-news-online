The African National Congress (ANC) National Working Committee (NWC) members will meet later on Saturday with the newly established Provincial Interim Structure of the party in Rustenburg, North West. The NWC members will also meet with the provinceâ€™s regional leadership, party councillors and mayors including members of the provincial legislature. The province is still facing political instability, particularly within some municipalities. Part of the engagement by the NWC members with its deployees is to formally introduce the provincial interim committee, led by former Member of Parliament, Hlomane Chauke. The national leadership will also engage with municipal councillors to further give them marching orders. This as some municipalities are performing badly, something that led to the provincial government intervening by stripping them powers. This has had a severe negative impact on service delivery.
