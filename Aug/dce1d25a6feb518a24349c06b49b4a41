City of Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has called the move by the African National Congress (ANC) to table a motion of no confidence against him as nothing more than a ploy. The ANC is tabling the motion in three weeks, saying that the city is facing a financial crisis. The ANC has also accused the Democratic Alliance (DA) of corruption saying that a tender of three fleet contracts valued at R3.9-billion was illegally awarded and that Mashaba’s Chief of Staff pocketed a R500 000 salary increase. The ANC and its partners have 136 votes, the EFF has 30 while the DA has 103. Mashaba’s spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka says the ANC is just politicking. “The motion of no confidence has nothing to do with the reasons they advance, but everything to do with resuming the rampant looting that characterised the ANC’s tenure in Johannesburg. Indeed, the ANC cannot fathom the prospect of contesting the upcoming election without access to city resources which have been looted by corrupt means. Ultimately greater investment is coming into the city almost to the tune of R20-million.”
