Residents of Mogalakwena municipality, which includes Mokopane, are staging a total shutdown protest, demanding justice for the murder of two African National Congress (ANC) politicians in Limpopo. The whistleblowers were gunned down last month, as politicians probing corruption and looting in the province were being targeted. Residents marched to Magwelereng and Mokopane which is the lifeline of economic activities in Mokopane. The town is in total lockdown, no business has opened but the march remains peaceful.
