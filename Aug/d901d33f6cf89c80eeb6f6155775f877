Former Free State Treasury official Anna Fourie has told the State Capture Commission that she raised concerns regarding the improper procurement processes followed in the approval of the Estina Dairy Farm Project. She told the inquiry the Estina payments were in breach of the Public Finance Management Act. Fourie detailed to Chairperson Raymond Zondo how she was approached to assist in one of the payments amounting to R30 million. This occurred while she was attending a farewell function of a colleague in 2015. She says she raised her concerns to the Agriculture Departmentâ€™s Chief Financial Officer following her assessment of agreement between the Department and Gupta-linked Estina that had been signed a week earlier.
