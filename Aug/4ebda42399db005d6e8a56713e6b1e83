The bail application for convicted murderer and former property mogul, Jason Rohde, will be heard on Wednesday in the High Court in Cape Town. Rohde was granted leave to appeal his conviction and sentence in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein last month. A date for the hearing has not yet been set. He wants bail pending the hearing. Rodhe was sentenced in February this year to an effective 20 years in jail for the murder of his wife, Susan, at the Spier Hotel in Stellenbosch three years ago. He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
