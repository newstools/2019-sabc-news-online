A senior police officer who commanded the police raids on traders of counterfeit goods in the Joburg CBD earlier in August is expected to testify in the Johannesburg Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday. The police colonel is expected to testify in the bail application of five police officers arrested on charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice. The five police officers allegedly demanded a bribe while escorting the owners of the seized goods. They allege one, Colonel Pillay, ordered for the release of the goods as they were not counterfeit but second-hand goods. They allege it was Pillay who granted them permission to off-load the goods. During the police officers court appearance last week, Magistrate Basimane Molwana ordered that Pillay be summoned to appear in court on Monday. Watch a related video below:
