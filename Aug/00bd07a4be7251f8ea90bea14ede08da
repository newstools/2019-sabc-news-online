The Eastern Cape Stock theft task team has confiscated a large amount of dangerous weapons including 20 fire arms and 24 magazines. The raid was conducted in the OR Tambo region including Bityi, Qumbu and Tsolo. Eastern Cape police spokesperson, Captain Khaya Tonjeni, says at least 16 people have been arrested and are facing a charge of possession of unlicensed firearms. Tonjeni says stock theft is rife in the area. “The Provincial Commissioner [Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga] heeded to the call of communities within these respective areas, complaining that Modus Operandi now of stock theft has rose to aggravated robbery, where owners are pointed with guns and their livestock are taken,” adds Tonjeni. “She did not waste time; he assembled a high calibre team where it was instructed that they disarm all these people holding these weapons,” explains Tonjeni.
