ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has hit back at his one-time ally, former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana. On Wednesday, Dukwana testified at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that Magashule pocketed millions of rands as kickbacks for helping to facilitate a controversial R255 million asbestos audit project. Magashule, who’s served as Free State Premier for just over eight years, says Dukwana was a central figure in concluding questionable government deals during his time as the MEC. Magashule says he remains unperturbed by Dukwana’s claims. He says, “The issue of the Zondo Commission and Dukwana is not an issue for me. Dukwana has said a lot of things, he says he has not signed documents. He talked about the new city and he told the commission that he did not sign any documents and we have documents to show he has signed. His signature is attached.” “The man is earning without working, without paying tax, he is getting money every month,” adds Magashule. Watch related video below…
