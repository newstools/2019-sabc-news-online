The court case of pastor Timothy Omotoso will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Thursday. Judge Irma Schoeman is expected to rule on the defence lawyer Peter Dauberman’s application to compel the state to provide more particulars on the charge sheet. On Wednesday, Dauberman told the court that there weren’t enough details regarding places and times when certain incidents took place and that if they were allowed to remain in the current form, his client would be disadvantaged. Defence lawyer, Peter Dauberman argued that the exclusion of certain details from the charge sheet makes it difficult to prepare defence. He told the court that the state did not make any effort to investigate claims made by the complainants. Referring to the previous testimony given by first state witness, Cheryl Zondi, Dauberman said had he not been aware of the time frame in that particular incident, his client wouldn’t have been able to give an alibi. If Schoeman approves the application, this will lead to further delays as a new indictment will have to be formulated. Watch a related video below:
