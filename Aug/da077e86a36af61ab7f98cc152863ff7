President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Biarritz, France, to participate in the G7 Summit that is focused on the elimination of inequalities of various kinds globally. He is accompanied by Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Dr Naledi Pandor and Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. The G7 is a forum of the seven countries with the world’s most industrialised and developed economies – France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada – whose government leaders meet annually to discuss important global economic, political, social and security issues.   South Africa will utilise the Summit to promote its economic agenda and particularly to promote itself as a major investment destination.
