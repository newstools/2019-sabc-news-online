The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) in Limpopo says it is concerned about the safety of its members following the shooting incident at the Polokwane provincial hospital. A patient allegedly shot and wounded a nurse, before killing himself Friday night. Denosa provincial organiser, Jacob Molepo, says security is a huge concern at health facilities. “As Denosa Limpopo we are shocked and devastated about the incident which occurred in the renal unit in Pietersburg Hospital; so as Denosa Limpopo we are very much concerned about the safety of our members in the health facilities ’cause the incident clearly indicates that there is a lack of security in our facilities. We are still struggling to establish how did the patient get access into the health facility with the gun.” Meanwhile, the family of the patient who allegedly shot and wounded a nurse, before killing himself blames authorities at the Polokwane provincial hospital for the incident. The relatives say the 46-year-old man had been complaining that he was being mistreated by staff at the hospital’s renal unit for a long time. Family spokesperson Phumudzo Mutshaina, believes the incident could have been prevented if authorities had attended to his brother’s complaints.
