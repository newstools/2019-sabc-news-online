Themba Thubane has been handed two life sentences the double murder of cousins in what is believed to have been ritual killings. On Monday, Thubane pleaded guilty to seven charges that include house breaking, kidnapping and the murder of Gabisile Shabane who was living with albinism and her one-year-old cousin, Nkosikhona Ngwenya in January last year. Both the defence and the state made final mitigating and aggravating submissions to the court. Thubane and three co-accused allegedly broke into the children’s home and abducted them. The three other accused Thokozani Msibi, Knowledge Mhlanga and Brilliant Mkhize have denied all the charges against them. Shabane’s body was found dumped in Cullinan east of Pretoria and the other body was found dumped on the N4 highway.
