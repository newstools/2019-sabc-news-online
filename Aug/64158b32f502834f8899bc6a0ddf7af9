Small Business Development Minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says she’s yet to meet with the Hawker’s Association to discuss a way forward, following last Thursday’s attacks on law enforcement agencies in the Johannesburg CBD. Police officers were attacked while raiding counterfeit goods in the City Centre. Four police vehicles were damaged. It’s alleged that the attackers were foreign nationals. However, the Minister says there’s no proof that the perpetrators were foreigners. “You cannot say the people who were involved were foreign nationals, because you don’t want to stir up emotions that are not there. There were people who went there and said they were foreign nationals, but the question is were they involved in the pelting of the police? If they were we have the responsibility for the police to arrest them. So, those are the questions we’ll answer when the law enforcement agencies have done their part of arresting for those that were involved,” says Ntshavheni.  Earlier the deputy director-general in the department of small business development, Lindokuhle Mkhumane spoke Stephen Grootes.
