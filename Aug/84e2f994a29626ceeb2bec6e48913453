The Gauteng Human Settlements and Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile says nine out of 11 municipalities in the province are at risk of degenerating to a dysfunctional level. This comes after the Auditor General’s report for the 2017/2018 financial year showed a regression in the financial state of municipalities. Some of the challenges include alleged corruption and fraud, violent service delivery protests, not paying for services, poor financial management and huge service delivery backlogs. Maile has established a committee to investigate these problems. He says unacceptably high levels of wasteful expenditure are emerging in metros, with Tshwane topping the list. “There’s a lot of issues relating to supply chain processes not being followed. There’s wasteful, fruitless expenditure, unauthorized expenditure, irregular expenditure. And the number of those transactions have increased drastically which is a cause of concern for us  hence we wrote to the municipality and asked them to give a plan on how to deal with the issue and we will also support them.”
