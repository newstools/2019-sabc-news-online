The situation is back to normal in the Pretoria CBD following Wednesday’s chaotic scenes. A task team was established to seek a solution to the situation. The violent looting follows taxi protests over the killing of a taxi driver. The driver was shot dead on Tuesday whilst he was allegedly stopping drug dealers from selling drugs to young people at the taxi rank. Metro police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says police will continue to monitor the situation. “What we can confirm at this stage is that streets that were closed from yesterday (Wednesday) have since been reopened and this morning (Thursday) again everything is normal in the CBD. We urge motorists that they can utilise those streets that were closed earlier on, but metro police and the SAPS will be deployed in those areas to monitor the situation until we are sure that the situation is back to normal.
