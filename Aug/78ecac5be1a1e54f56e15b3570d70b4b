The Mayor of Johannesburg Herman Mashaba and municipal unions, South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) and Independent Municipal & Allied Trade Union (Imatu) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) aimed at minimising strikes during labour disputes. The City says the MoU is the first of its kind and hopes the understanding will result in improved service delivery. Mashaba says protests should be a last resort during labour disputes. “They’ve got the right to strike in the event the employer is unfair; they follow the process, nothing stops them from exercising their right to strike I think it’s enshrined in our Constitution and that is not what we are actually taking away. What we are doing here is to actually normalise labour relations,” says Mashaba. Watch related video below for more on the story:
