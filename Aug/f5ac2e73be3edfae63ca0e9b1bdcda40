The ANC has confirmed that redeployed eThekwini mayor – Zandile Gumede – has finally tendered her resignation from office as directed by the party’s provincial leadership. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe  says Gumede is among the ANC office bearers in the eThekwini metro and uMsunduzi municipality who have finally tendered their resignation letters. The ANC decided earlier this month to redeploy its executive committee members in the two municipalities due to what the party said was poor performance. The provincial ANC says some of the office bearers did not meet the Monday midday deadline to quit. Mabe was speaking exclusively to SABC News.
