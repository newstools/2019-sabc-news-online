The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) has disbanded the Western Cape Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). This is according to a statement released by the party earlier on Friday. “The NEC expressed concern on the functioning of the Provincial Executive Committee in the Western Cape whose growing internal disintegration plays itself out in the public, making it difficult for the PEC to discharge its duties” reads the statement in part.” “The ANC will send its Western Cape NEC deployees to the province to engage with structures as part of organizational building and renewal.” The party says it will establish a Provincial Interim Committee, which will be tasked with implementing “the process of renewal and rebuilding in the province and to prepare the province towards an elective provincial conference.” Former ANC Provincial Secretary, Faiez Jacobs says they welcome the decision. He says the term of the party’s provincial structure was supposed to have ended in June. Jacobs says they will work hard to ensure strong ANC branches.
