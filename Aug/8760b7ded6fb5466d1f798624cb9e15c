The 16 expelled African National Congress (ANC) councillors at the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in Qwaqwa in the Free State have blamed ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, for their expulsion from the party. They were axed from the ANC after they were found guilty for voting with the opposition in the removal of former executive mayor, Vusi Tshabalala. 15 of the expelled councillors will be participating in the by-election on the 28th of August after vacancies were declared in their respective wards. The group’s spokesperson, Paratlane Motloung explains why they blame Magashule. “Indeed, the ANC Secretary-General is exactly in the centre of the problems that (we) experience here. At the time, when he was still the Chairperson of Provincial Executive Committee of the ANC here and when he was still the premier, he was basically controlling the lives of all the people of the Free State. And I must say, he benefitted directly from the corruption that took place here at Maluti-a-Phofung,” explains Motloung.
