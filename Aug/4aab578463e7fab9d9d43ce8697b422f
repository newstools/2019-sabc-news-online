The Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she will seek leave to appeal the ruling of the High Court in Pretoria that she should pay 7.5% of the costs in her personal capacity and her office 85% in the case which relates to her Vrede dairy farm report which was previously set aside as unconstitutional. The Council for the Advancement South African Constitution (CASAC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) approached the High Court to have the report set aside. They requested that Mkhwebane pay the costs in her personal capacity. The Public Protector’s spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, says they’re extremely concerned about the negative court orders that are seemingly bankrupting her. “The Public Protector disagrees with the outcome today (Thursday) just like she disagreed with the first aspect of it earlier this year. She believes that for one to incur personal cost orders it should have been proven that she acted fraudulently, she acted recklessly and that there was gross dishonesty on her part, and those have not been proven in this particular matter which is why she’s disappointed with the outcome and she will be challenging it.” WATCH BELOW:
