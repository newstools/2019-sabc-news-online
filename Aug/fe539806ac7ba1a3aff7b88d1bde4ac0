The rape trial of Jesus Dominion International leader, Timothy Omotoso, will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Monday. The prosecutor will obtain a new certificate authorising the latest indictment. Defence advocate Peter Dauberman made the application saying the authorisation certificate does not correspond with the indictment. Daubermann also told Judge Irma Schoeman that the court only had jurisdiction over seven of the 97 charges, on which the accused pleaded not guilty. Omotoso and his co-accused face a total of 97 charges jointly. Click on the video below:
