The North Gauteng High Court is expected to hear the latest tussle involving Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane  on Thursday. President Cyril Ramaphosa is seeking an urgent interdict against Mkhwebane’s recommended remedial action. The matter was not heard on Tuesday due to the unavailability of a judge. The case relates to Mkhwebane’s findings that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan unlawfully authorised the early retirement of then SARS Deputy Commissioner, Ivan Pillay. In her report, Mkhwebane instructed Ramaphosa to take appropriate action against Gordhan in the matter. Earlier this week, the court suspended the PP’s remedial actions against Gordhan pending a judicial review of the so-called SARS rogue unit. Watch a related video below:
