Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso remains a prohibited person in South Africa. This after the Hawks and officials from the Department of Home Affairs dismissed his application to have his prohibited status lifted. Earlier, Judge lrma Schoeman dismissed Omotoso’s defence lawyer Peter Dauberman’s application to compel the state to provide more particulars on the charge sheet. Watch video below for more on the story: On Wednesday, Dauberman had told the court that there weren’t  enough details regarding places and times when certain incidents took place and that if it was allowed to stand as is, the defence would be ambushed. Dauberman argued that the exclusion of certain details from the charge sheet makes it difficult to prepare defence. He told the court that the state did not make any effort to investigate claims made by the complainants. Referring to the previous testimony given by first state witness, Cheryl Zondi, Dauberman said had he not been aware of the time-frame in that particular incident, his client wouldn’t have been able to give an alibi. Had Schoeman approved the application, that would have led to further delays as a new indictment would have to be formulated.
