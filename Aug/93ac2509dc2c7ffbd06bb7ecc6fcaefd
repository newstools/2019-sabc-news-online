The University of South Africa (Unisa) will rename three of its historical buildings on its Muckleneuk Campus in Pretoria. The buildings will be named after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Professor Nkoana Radipere and Anton Lambede, who each played a vital role in contributing to shaping the university and society. Unisa’s Executive Director in the Department of Institutional Advancement, Khanya Mahlare, says the renaming of the buildings is aimed at re-purposing the university’s buildings to represent what the people stood for. Mahlare said, “This process started last year where as a university, we called stakeholders to make inputs into the transformation agenda of the university. This transformation agenda being of course trying to fit into the vision of the institution and what it stands for and the vision being towards the African university shaping futures in the service of humanity.”
