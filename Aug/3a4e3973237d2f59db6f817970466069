The health sector has power to create thousands of jobs and bridge the inequality gap in South Africa. That’s according to Doctor Guni Goolab, from the Government Employee Medical Scheme, GEMS who was speaking at the Hospital Association of South Africa conference in Cape Town. Some of the topics under discussion included the National Health Insurance and various challenges facing the health sector and the country. Goolab say the health sector has a major role to play in the South African economy. “No other sector than the health sector can generate employment at both ends of the value chain. So, if you take the top end with highly skilled specialists in bringing technology and research, the lowest end of the scale, whether it’s in palliative care or in home care or in frail care, we can employ people to look after the poor. So, I think that this sector cannot only improve the health of the nation, but should be looked at a key sector or employment generation in global competitiveness.”
