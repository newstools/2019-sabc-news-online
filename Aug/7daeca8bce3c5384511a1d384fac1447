Acting KwaZulu-Natal Commissioner for Correctional Services, James Smalberger says more officials and members of senior management at Durban’s Westville Prison may be dismissed following investigations into corruption. Cellphone footage emerged showing prisoners and warders allegedly snorting what appears to be cocaine and smoking other drugs inside their jail cells. In a second video, warders are seen handing weapons to prisoners and allegedly encouraging them to fight.  Smalberger says they have assigned seasoned investigators to the matter. “We assigned seasoned investigators and they have completed their investigations and the process of further actions will follow and when the delegated authorities have applied their minds in terms of those, I can assure the public that we will not accept that behaviour by our officials who allow that and those who’ve turned a blind eye. We will not accept that and we will fight corruption and maladministration.” Smalberger was speaking after the announcement that Commissioner, Mnikelwa Nxele had been axed. Nxele was implicated in the State Capture Commission as allegedly receiving monthly bribes of about R57 000. Smalberger says the department will continue to function.
