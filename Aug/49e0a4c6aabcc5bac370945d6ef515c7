An investigation by the Special Investigating Unity (SIU) has found damning evidence against former SABC Interim Board members relating to a R185 million security tender at the public broadcaster. The SIU says it has found evidence of irregularities in the Interim Board’s procurement and awarding of a security contract to Mafoko Security in 2017. This is allegedly despite Mafoko being ranked second in a bidding process. Mjayeli Security Services is reported to have been a bidder scoring high in pricing, but the Board overruled its own supply chain processes and awarded the contract to Mafoko. The SIU has now finalised its report into the investigation and has found wrongdoing on the part of the Interim Board. It says Board members failed to act in the best interest of the SABC and wants them declared delinquent once civil proceedings are finalised.
