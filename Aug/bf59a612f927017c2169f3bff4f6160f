The Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union (SACTWU), which is an affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu) has signed an agreement following negotiations with the Supported Employment Enterprises sector. The new agreement comprises of improvements relating to wages, healthcare, and housing allowances. “We have managed to agree to a settlement offer, which will equate to just over 11%. But if you break it down, the amount on wages would be about 5.3 %, you have R50 towards housing allowance, and then the medical aid solution is just over 4 %,” says  SACTWU’s spokesperson, Magdalene Jacobs.
