Former SABC Interim Board members Khanyisile Kweyama, Febe Potgieter-Qubule, Mathatha Tsedu, Krish Naidoo and John Matisonn will on Tuesday respond to the Special Investigative Unit’s (SIU) report which found evidence of irregularities in the awarding of a R185-million security tender by the interim board in 2017. The tender was given to Mafoko Security Patrols despite another company, MJAYELI, reportedly scoring high. “The interim board members are expected to brief the media in Johannesburg later today. They maintain however,  that there was nothing untoward in them awarding the multi-million rand security tender to Mafoko.  They’ve dismissed the SIU report as flawed and wants it set aside. Mafoko has also indicated its intention to challenge any plans to review the contract.  However the losing bidder – Mjayeli says it wont comment until all legal processes have been exhausted.  The current SABC board has reserved its comment until the matter comes before court.” WATCH BELOW:
