The Chief Risk Officer of the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) Mark Mainganya will on Friday testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. The evidence is expected to focus on alleged fraud and corruption in the process of EML Energy securing funding from the IDC to supply fuel to SAA.
