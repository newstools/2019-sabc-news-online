The African National Congress (ANC) says it is not aware of any acts of illegality by any of its leaders during the party’s 2017 leadership campaign. This follows leaked emails that allegedly provide details on donors for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC leadership campaign. The emails were published by News24 over the weekend, allegedly showing that Ramaphosa knew who some of the donors for his campaign were. In a recent report, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa misled Parliament about a R500 000 donation he received from Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. Ramaphosa has taken the report on review. The ANC says the email leak is an attempt to undermine public confidence in Ramaphosa. ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte says the party supports Ramaphosa’s version of events. “You base your narrative on leaked emails, but you also have to have the responsibility to say where those emails come from. The President has given his truth in this matter, to say there is one email that I do recognise, the President had made available from his own pocket money for the campaign.” “When he says he didn’t know, we believe in the ANC that we accept that. If he says he didn’t know, he is not going to say he didn’t know when he knew.” Related video click below:
