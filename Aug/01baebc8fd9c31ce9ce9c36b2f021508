Political analyst Levy Ndou says South Africans have the right to know the extent of Cyril Ramaphosa‘s involvement in raising funds for his African National Congress presidential campaign. Forty leaked emails have reportedly revealed some of the donors to the CR17 campaign. News 24 has published several emails and names of the people who the managers of Ramaphosa’s campaign had approached for funding. The publication says the emails have been verified. In her report, the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found that Ramaphosa misled Parliament when he was asked about who funded his campaign. Ramaphosa has since taken the report on judicial review. Ndou says the campaign team should come clean. “What we need to put on the table is that there’s nothing wrong in receiving donations for your campaign but there’s also nothing wrong in actually coming forward and saying these are the people who funded my activity because we all know that it actually required funding.” “If indeed the President was directly involved, it is up to him or his campaign team to say to which extent he has been involved in terms of raising funds and I think that is where now, we are actually heading towards.” Related video click below:
