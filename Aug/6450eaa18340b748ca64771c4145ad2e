Four people have been killed and at least 15 others were injured in a multi-vehicle collision on the M1 highway near the Xavier off-ramp, south of Johannesburg. Traffic is heavily backed up. Johannesburg Metro Police Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says: “The road is closed, with only one lane open and motorists are advised to use the M12 as an alternative route.”
