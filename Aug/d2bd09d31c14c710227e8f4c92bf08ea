The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has condemned the destruction of a councillor’s house in Langa in Cape Town allegedly by what it calls criminal elements. The party says it has received a letter of complaint around Councillor Samkelo John’s performance from some community members in Ward 52. Spokesperson Nobukhosi Dlamini says they have been trying to meet with the group to find a way forward. “Still going to hold a meeting with the community to understand what are the complaints about the Councillor and we condemn the criminal actions of actually bombing the house because the people who have complained about his performance actually did not utilise the platform for the meeting to come and express their frustrations or what was the issue around the councillor’s performance.”
