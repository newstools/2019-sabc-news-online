Rand Water says its technicians are still working to restore water to a number of areas after a major pipe burst in Johannesburg. Areas in the North and east of the city have been affected.  These include parts of Germiston, Bedfordview, Primrose, Kempton Park, Halfway House, Rooihuiskraal, Kosmosdal, Southcrest, Linmeyer and Diepsloot. Rand Water’s Justice Mohale says they have isolated the problem “They had to close all the valves so that they can drain the water that was in that pipe, so its been massive work. At the moment we can’t say when the project will be completed because remember, even after we have completed the project the engineers have to test that pipeline.”
