The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Inquiry will continue on Monday morning in Parktown, Johannesburg with testimony from former NPA head Mxolisi Nxasana. The inquiry is diverting from Estina Dairy Farm Project matter for a day and will continue with former head of the Free State Agriculture Department, Peter Thabetheâ€™s evidence from last week. Nxasana left his position as NPA boss, after a R17.3 million settlement with former President Jacob Zuma. He will be appearing for the second time at the commission. During his first appearance at the commission, Nxasana testified about the political and external interference at the public prosecutions office. In 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled that Nxasana should pay back over R10 million paid to him as part of a R17.3 million settlement when he was released from office by former President Jacob Zuma. The court found that his termination was unconstitutional and invalid. Related video click below:
