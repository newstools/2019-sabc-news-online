North Korea’s latest projectile appears to be a short-range ballistic missile, South Korea said on Saturday. The launch on Saturday morning was aimed at testing capabilities of North Korea’s new type of short-range missile it is developing on its own, as well as protesting South Korea-US joint drills this month, the South Korean presidential office said in a statement. Pyongyang fired two projectiles into the sea off its eastern coast on Saturday in its latest weapons launch following a series of missile tests in recent months. The presidential office said the chief of South Korea’s national security office, the country’s defence minister and head of the intelligence agency held a video conference to discuss North Korea’s weapons launch.
