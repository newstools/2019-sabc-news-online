The attempted murder trial of ex-convict Mark Scott-Crossley is expected to resume in the Lenyenye Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo on Monday. Scott-Crossley is accused of deliberately running over Silence Mabundza with a vehicle in December 2016. During his last appearance, the court set aside Scott-Crossley’s application to have all charges against him dismissed. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence that the accused had to answer. Scott-Crossley was arrested a month after the alleged incident. He was on the run. The defence has indicated that it will submit documents to appeal the judge’s decision not to dismiss the case. Scott-Crossley is currently out on bail.
