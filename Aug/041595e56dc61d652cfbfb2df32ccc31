The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has welcomed what it terms the commitments that the businessman Adam Catzavelos has made. This is after Catzavelos admitted that his use of the ‘K’ word in a video that went viral on social media while he was in Greece last year, was disgusting. He also made a public apology as part of a R150 000 settlement in a civil matter that was heard in the Equality Court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg. However, Catzavelos lost his bid to avoid prosecution on a charge of crimen injuria that the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) had brought. “Our role is not only to condemn racism where it raises its ugly head but we also have an important role as a Chapter Nine institution of embedding a culture of human rights, of promoting human rights principles, and we see this agreement as part of an endeavour to promote social cohesion, promote nation-building in South Africa,” says the commission’s Buang Jones.
