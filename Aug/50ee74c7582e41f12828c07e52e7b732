The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court has ordered the deportation of some of the foreign nationals who were arrested during a counterfeit goods raid in the city centre last week. More than 600 illegal traders were kept at Johannesburg Central Police Station for verification. While some of them have since been released, more than 300 of them are now appearing individually in court, with those without proper documentation facing deportation. Seven police officers were also arrested for allegedly trying to resell confiscated counterfeit goods to illegal traders. The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court has made an order that the foreign nationals who failed to prove that they are legal in the country must be deported. The illegal foreigners, who are going to be deported within the next 30 days, will be detained at the Lindela Repatriation Centre in Krugersdorp. The seven police officers who were also arrested on Wednesday will be appearing in court Monday afternoon. Watch video below for more on the story:
