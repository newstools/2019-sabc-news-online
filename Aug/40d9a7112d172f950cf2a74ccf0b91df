The Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, says the commission’s team does its best to refrain from using funds unnecessarily in their investigations. Tuesday marked one year since the Commission began its work. The Commission has gone through a vast number of witnesses and volumes of documents. Speaking to SABC News, Zondo said the Commission’s team aims to carry out their work without fear, favour or prejudice. “From the beginning of this financial year, up to now, I think we have spent over R100 million, but I don’t have the figures from the beginning of the commission last year (2018). It costs a lot of money, but throughout, it is our duty to make sure that, as far as possible, we don’t spend one more cent of taxpayers’ money unnecessarily and we keep that in mind. What is important is that we have always got to bear in mind that we must carry out our mandate without fear, favour or prejudice. At the end of the day, what I say to the team; when we have finished with the work of the commission, we must be able to say that we have done a good job.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
