Neo Solutions Director Vivien Natasen has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture he did not see anything wrong in giving former SAA express Commercial Manager Brian van Wyk R300 000 in cash when he needed the money urgently. Natasen says van Wyk told him he wanted the money to buy a vintage car. The Director neither questioned Van Wyk nor followed up with the former SAA Express general manager if he had indeed used the money to buy his vintage car. Evidence leader Advocate Kate Hofmeyr questioned the director on why he did not ask Van Wyk why he could not get the money from the bank as he was in a capacity to do so. Natasen gave Van Wyk the money from his personal funds in his personal capacity. Van Wyk is alleged to have used the R300 000 to buy reflector jackets for an ANC celebration event. The testimony continues. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
