The Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) have cautioned police against placing all foreigners into the category of illegal migrants. Earlier this week, police raided shops believed to have been selling counterfeit goods in the Johannesburg CDB. They confiscated large quantities goods including clothing and sneakers as well as unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Seven police officers were later arrested for alleged corruption and defeating the ends of justice relating to Wednesday’s raid. The head of the LHR’s Johannesburg Law Clinic, Jessica Lawrence, says police investigations should be conducted in a procedurally fair and legal manner. “What we are seeing currently is that many people have just been arrested on the basis of being foreign. So migrants within South Africa particularly asylum-seekers and refugees are incredibly vulnerable and often people flee their home countries due to persecution on the basis of political opinion, gender, sexual orientation as well as war, so people come to South Africa seeking protection from the South African state,” says Lawrence.
