Authorities are obtaining the biometrics of South Africans in preparation for the eventual introduction of the National Health Insurance (NHI), Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced on Thursday in Pretoria. NHI will, one day, provide health care to all South Africans, regardless of their financial means. The long-awaited NHI Bill was introduced in Parliament on Thursday and is to be fully implemented in 2026. Mkhize says the system will be accessible anywhere in the country. “At the moment, we’re going through a process of registering South Africans as beneficiaries to NHI, which basically has something that, that’s got a central database that knows who are in the system. The day you decide to go and see your grandmother in Parys, then in fact, you are able to say I got pneumonia when I was in Parys and the system will recognise who you are because it knows that you were part of the system.”   Related Videos:
