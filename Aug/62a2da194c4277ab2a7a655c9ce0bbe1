The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will hear the testimony of Neo Solutions Director Vivien Natasen on Thursday morning in Parktown, Johannesburg. He appeared in July before the Commission. Natasen testified that he did not benefit through payments from South African Express Airways. He said he was merely safekeeping R10-million and returned it. On Wednesday, former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana told the Commission that a system of patronage and intimidation had created a culture of fear in the Free State province. Dukwana was fired as MEC by then Premier Ace Magashule in 2012. He told the Commission that the system still exists. “The system is still there… It is continuing up until you deal with the system. As I say, you can do whatever now, you can put any person you think is better, they would not be able to do anything meaningful in that province up until you’ve dealt with the system that has been introduced in the Free State and people will just play dumb. I saw one witness who was here, you could see the difficulty the person was facing accepting, he would just take responsibility and take the fall for others but the person knows exactly what happened.” Click on the videos below:
