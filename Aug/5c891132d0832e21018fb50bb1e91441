Marking Women’s Day in Port Elizabeth’s notorious northern areas, the Democratic Alliance (DA) encouraged women to speak out. The party focused on violence and abuse suffered by women. Gang-related crimes in the northern areas have claimed more than 200 lives over the past two years. The victims are often women and children. Nomafrench Mbombo the DA Women’s Network National Leader says: “We decided to come here because it is where women are most vulnerable and suffer the most. This is where sex for jobs scandals are, where violence is and where poverty is. It is time that a voice is provided for women. It cannot be that 25 years post democracy, women still go through so much.” Women are encouraged to report any form of violence. Georgina Faldtman the DA Women’s Network EC chair says: “Women in South Africa are still suffering a lot. They are being killed every day and being abused sexually. There’s something growing in the Eastern Cape where women have to sell their bodies to get jobs. So we are here to encourage women to say whatever is going on if you are a victim, just come forward and speak out, go to the nearest police station and report.” Statistics show that one in five South African women over the age of 18 have experienced physical violence.
