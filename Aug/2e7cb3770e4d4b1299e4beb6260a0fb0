Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says the ball is now in the SABC’s court regarding when it will receive assistance from the National Treasury. Last week, the Communications Ministry and National Treasury sent a joint letter to the board of the public broadcaster requesting the leadership to address some matters before the financial assistance is released. Ndabeni-Abrahams says they are now waiting for the SABC board to respond. She was speaking on the side-lines of a preparatory meeting in East London ahead of the World Communication Conference to be held in Egypt in November. “We recently jointly sent out a letter to SABC last week stipulating the things that have not been thoroughly addressed and the board chair and his executive are aware of that. We are waiting for them to respond to those so that Treasury can then unleash the money that they are supposed to take out.” “You will know that we have said we will source the service of G-tech to assist technically in terms of assisting the turnaround plan because every time government has to put money, there must be assurance that indeed the entity will not come back and ask for a bailout.” Click video below:
