Former Environmental Affairs Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, has vowed to tell her version of events on the BOSASA saga, including the roles played by the late BOSASA CEO Gavin Watson and former BOSASA COO, Angelo Agrizzi. Agrizzi testified on the BOSASA scandal earlier this year at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture implicating several senior ANC leaders in alleged attempts to secure tenders. Mokonyane was speaking at Watson’s memorial service, in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg on Friday. The CEO of the facilities company – now known as African Global Operations – died in a vehicle crash near the OR Tambo International Airport on Monday. His funeral service is due to be held in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Speaking at the memorial service Mokonyane says: “My time will come, I will tell you what Gavin has done and not what Agrizzi is saying. I will also tell you what Agrizzi has done. My time will come.”
