Opposition parties in the Uthukela District Municipality in Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal, are calling for the removal of the deputy mayor from her position. The Deputy Mayor Nombali Mchunu allegedly used a state vehicle to attend a soccer match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates in Gauteng and the vehicle was stolen. Ladysmith community members and the municipality’s opposition parties are calling for an investigation into the authorisation of the deputy mayor’s trip to Johannesburg. It is alleged that she took two vehicles on the trip – a main car and a back-up car. The Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Khulekani Msibi says Mchunu should pay for the stolen vehicle and the African National Congress (ANC) should take steps against her. “The money must be taken from the deputy mayor’s salary and the deputy mayor must be removed from their position as a deputy mayor of the municipality and it’s up to the ANC as the ruling party to do that. But if the ANC won’t do that we will see what we will do as the opposition. We will put the motion that we won’t trust her, because you can’t take the money from the rate payers and poor people and use it in your own capacity not the municipality.”
