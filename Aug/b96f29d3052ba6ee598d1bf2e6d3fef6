A State Capture witness has fled the country out of fear for her life. The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has been told that Koroneka Trading and Projects Director, Babadi Tlatsana has received several death threats. Lawyers representing Tlatsana said she fled the country to an unknown destination. Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says he is concerned about this new development and has asked the commission’s investigation team to get a full update on the matter. Tlatsana had earlier this year told Justice Zondo her company was hijacked by SA express to loot money from the North West government. Evidence leader Advocate Kate Hofmeyr says, “At the conclusion of Ms Tlatsana’s evidence she was requested to provide a further affidavit to the commission in which she would account in full for the R51 million that came into the accounts of Koroneka and the commission took steps after her evidence to follow up with her and obtain that affidavit.” “There were threats made to Ms Tlatsana before the commission and after her evidence. As a consequence of that she left the Republic in fear for her life.”
