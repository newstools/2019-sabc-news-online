The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) president Bathabile Dlamini has warned against members of the ANC who are quick to defend themselves against allegations regarding the CR17 campaign. She says the tendency to always put money into party internal campaigns is beginning to gain momentum within the movement and must end. Dlamini says she believes all the revelations are planned somewhere, with the aim to whip some within the movement. She spoke to SABC News earlier on Tuesday. “All this fight that is in front of us – is planned somewhere else and it is meant to whip our emotions. And therefore we all have to be sober -not rush to either defend ourselves because we received money or rush to throw stones, but there are questions we have to ask.” Dlamini says as the Women’s League their conscience is clear after conducting what she terms a clean campaign for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s bid for the ANC presidency. “There was overwhelming support for comrade Nkosazana, therefore we were pushing the campaign as an organisation. And we also used the funds of the ANC Women’s League to run the campaign,” says Dlamini. Watch related video below
