A 42-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the disappearance of 19-year-old University of Cape Town female student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, who went missing a week ago. The suspect was arrested in Claremont on Friday. Three detectives have been hired to help find Mrwetyana. Western Cape police spokesperson, Brigadier Novela Potelwa, says an extensive investigation is also underway to determine her whereabouts. “We are confident the interviewing of the 42 year old will eventually lead to the finalisation of the investigation thereby bringing an end to days of uncertainty for her family. Meanwhile DNA tests and an autopsy are expected to be performed soon on an unidentified body that was discovered in Lingelethu West, Khayelitsha, on Monday, in an effort to determine the identity and cause of death.”
