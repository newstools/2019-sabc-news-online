The Burkina Faso military said 24 soldiers were killed in an attack by unidentified militants on an army unit on Monday, updating a previous death toll of 10. In a statement on Tuesday, the army said it was continuing a land and air operation, launched in response to the attack in northern Burkina Faso, which has been overrun by Islamist violence this year. Seven other soldiers were wounded and five are still missing, it said. Earlier, a report said militants killed at least ten soldiers and wounded many others in an attack on a military unit in northern Burkina Faso. Militant violence has overrun Burkina Faso this year and armed forces have been unable to contain the situation. Hundreds of civilians have died and more than 150-thousand others have fled as the influence of militant groups with links to al-Qaeda and ISIS spreads across the Sahel region.
