The bail conditions of eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede have been relaxed by the Durban Commercial Crimes Court to allow her to exercise her duties. Facing corruption charges in connection with a R208 million refuse removal tender, the court earlier granted her R50 000 bail on condition that she may not contact municipal officials. These included the municipal manager and the chief financial officer. Gumedeâ€™s advocate, Jimmy House argued that the bail condition that she may not contact the staff in finance or supply chain management was used by the ANC to force her to take leave for the past two months. The court ruled in favour of the defence, relaxing the bail conditions of Gumede and her co-accused, Councillor Mondli Mthembu and businessman Craig Poonan. They are to appear in court again on January 15th 2020. Click on related videos below:
