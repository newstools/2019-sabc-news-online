The Forest High School in Turffontein in the south of Johannesburg will hold a memorial service on Tuesday morning for the learner who was stabbed to death last week Monday. The programme will last for an hour to allow schooling to continue. The suspect in the case, a fellow learner, has since been given bail. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “The school will be honouring the child. You will remember the unfortunate incident occurred outside the school, but today they are paying their last respect as a norm in our environment. The programme will start at around 11:30 and probably will be an hour.” Watch: video below on violence at schools…
