Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise says those who are calling on victims of apartheid to shut up and move on, are festering renewed racial divisions. She has called for the continuation of the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to foster unity among South Africans. Modise was delivering the keynote address in Cape Town at a Healing and Justice conference with the theme “Healing journeys, the relationship between healing and justice”. It’s organised by the Institute for the Healing of Memories. Modise says the nation needs to open up to each other in order for deep seated wounds to heal. “We have tried to shut up and move on. We are being pulled backwards by racist elements in the country, these racists have pushed the blacks into another extreme corner, if we don’t come in into the middle we will degenerate further. So it is up to us black and white to find one another again, because if we don’t do that we will have another full blown racial thing in South Africa and it will not be nice.”
