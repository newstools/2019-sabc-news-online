A newborn baby that was kidnapped on Thursday from the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto has been found unharmed. Police are still searching for suspects after the baby was found in a Diepkloof home in Soweto. It’s understood the baby was snatched during the afternoon visiting hours. The department revealed that CCTV footage from the hospital shows a female suspect roaming in and around the antenatal clinic and then later she was spotted exiting the maternity area, carrying a baby in a blanket. She is then seen with two accomplices where they swopped the blankets before leaving the hospital. Police Spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini says they followed a tip off from a neighbour. “This happened after a member of the public contacted the police. At this stage, the police are still visiting several scenes to determine who was involved in the stealing of the baby. Once a suspect has been arrested, police will be releasing information concerning the baby’s health. The baby will be taken back to the mother.” Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said he was disappointed with the apparent lapse of physical security. The Gauteng Department of Health is expected to brief the media sometime on Friday on the details of where and how the baby was found.
