The City of Johannesburg has reminded residents living in high lying areas that they may experience lower than normal water pressure from Monday. This is a result of Rand Water’s planned maintenance of some of its main pipelines which is expected to last for 54-hours. The shutdown will see the installation of a 2500-millimetre butterfly valve from Lethabo to Vereeniging pumping station. MMC for environment and infrastructure, Nico de Jager, has reiterated that there is no need for residents to panic. “We want to alay all fears addressed. There is no need to panic, there is no need to fill your bottles with water etc. There is no need to do that. Johannesburg Water, with Rand Water sat and came up with a plan to minimize the impact on our residents. All our reservoirs will be full by Monday when this interruption starts, as well as the Rand Water reservoir. Therefore we should have sufficient water to last us for a number of days.”
