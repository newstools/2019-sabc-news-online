Johannesburg Water has assured residents that there will be water for the entire duration of the planned shutdown by Rand Water from Monday. The shutdown which is expected to last for 54-hours, is part of Rand Water’s infrastructure maintenance programme which will see the installation of a 2 500 millimetre Butterfly valve from Lethabo to the Vereeniging pumping station. Residents may experience low water pressure in some areas. Joburg Water COO Derrick Kgwale says there’s no need for residents to panic. “There will always be constant supply even during the shutdown. There won’t be a time where there is no supply of water because water will be going through the plant for treatment and prior to the shutdown all reservoirs will be filled. So there will be sufficient water for the duration of the shutdown.” Watch related video:
