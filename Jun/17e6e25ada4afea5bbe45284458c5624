Former Transnet Group Treasurer Mathane Makgatho has told the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg that she resigned from Transnet because she felt the toxic environment at the State-owned Enterprise was beginning to take a toll on her health. Makgatho says she was also afraid that she would be physically harmed because she was told there were meetings in which she was described as a stumbling block. She says Transnet CEO Brian Molefe seemed to consider her as troublesome. Makgatho says the Chinese loan agreement that was approved by the Transnet board – after she resigned – was also based on a number of misrepresentations.  Earlier, she told the State Capture Inquiry that she regrets agreeing to travel back from China to South Africa with a mysterious suitcase that belonged to former Transnet Chief Financial Officer, Anoj Singh. She says she made the trip at his request after Singh held a meeting with a Chinese official during a trip to negotiate the terms of a Transnet loan.
