Economic Freedom Fighters leader, Julius Malema has called for the judiciary to be protected against those who  seek to capture it. He was speaking after his case – for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 was postponed to 8th November. This is to give the High Court in Pretoria sufficient time to finalise the Riotous Assemblies Act matter, as challenged by Malema as apartheid era legislation. It follows Malema’s calls during the 2014 EFF inaugural conference – when he called on people to invade vacant land. Malema addressed EFF supporters after appearing at the Bloemfontein Magistrate Court. “We cannot have judges that seek to impress politicians. What will happen to this country if the judiciary is captured? Then we are gone. It is the end of this country. We must protect our judiciary with everything. Some of the judges may not like us, like when we fought the capture of the executive. But today they thank us because we rescued this country from the Guptas. The judiciary is about to be captured.” Watch for more:
