Former National Director of Public Prosecutions Mxolisi Nxasana has conceded that there was political and external influence during his tenure at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). He is testifying before the Commission of inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. He says this started even before he took office. Nxasana says his predecessors, including Bulelani Ngcuka, Menzi Simelane, and Vusi Pikoli faced the same challenges during their terms. He says this led to the erosion of public trust in the institution, with Parliament having to intervene in most cases. “No doubt it does have an effect on public confidence in the NPA. Chair, there is a portfolio committee on Justice because NPA is also a unit falling under Justice, although it is independent. ” Earlier, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo appealed to the State Capture Commission of inquiry’s evidence leader, Advocate Paul Pretorius to make sure Nxasana’s evidence deals with capture of the NPA. Justice Zondo said this would assist the Commission to get the reasons for the weakening of prosecutions unit. Nxasana is one of many officials who have worked within the Judiciary that Justice Zondo has requested they be called to give evidence at the commission. Click on video below:
