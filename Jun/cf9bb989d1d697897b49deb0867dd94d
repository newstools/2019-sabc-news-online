Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde, says youth unemployment in the country is unacceptably high.  He says education and skills development are the key to unlocking the future for many young people. In his Youth Day message, he’s also renewed the provincial government’s commitment to continue to provide quality education in schools. Winde says the Western Cape government will expand access to education and invest in skills development programmes to prepare young people for future careers in the fields of science and technology, engineering, coding and mathematics. He says on June 16, 1976, young people stood up to demand a better life, and a better future. Winde says the province provides access to a wealth of information for young people through libraries, schools, youth cafés and free access to the internet. He says these tools will help them to connect to opportunities worldwide. Winde says his government is working on improving safety in the province and ending the abuse of young people.
