The Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) says it will appeal a High Court decision on a defamation case against former Finance minister Trevor Manuel at the Supreme Court of Appeal. The party’s application for leave to appeal the matter was dismissed by the High Court earlier on Tuesday. In a statement in March, the red berets accused Manuel of nepotism and corruption in influencing the appointment of new South African Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner Edward Kieswetter. Manuel was the head of a selection panel that interviewed candidates for the post. He approached the court following the allegations. In May the court found that the statement by the EFF was defamatory and false. It ordered the party to remove the statements about Manuel from all its media platforms. The red berets were also instructed to pay damages worth R 500 000 and pay Manuel’s legal costs. The party appealed the matter at the High Court. It says it will now approach the Supreme Courts of Appeal, and will take it as far as the Highest court in the land, if needs be.
