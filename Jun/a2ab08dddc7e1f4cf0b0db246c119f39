Fourteen people are in a critical condition in hospital after a train collided with Transnet’s tamping machine in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria on Saturday. Fifty seven people have been injured. Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng says the tamping machine had been authorised to leave the station long before the train arrived. It appears that the tamping machine had rolled onto the train, causing the collision. Mofokeng says the injured were transported to various hospitals. “Some, those that we know of, are actually taken to Steve Biko Academic hospital. They are actually being attended there as we speak, unless maybe those who would have went to the local hospital. We have no further report from the emergency services,” says Mofokeng.
