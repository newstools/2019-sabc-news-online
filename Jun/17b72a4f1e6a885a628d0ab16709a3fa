International Relations Minister, Naledi Pandor, has called on ambassadors to work together to respond effectively to international challenges. She says her department and members of the diplomatic corps have an important role to play to improve the lives of vulnerable communities throughout the world. She was hosting her first annual breakfast meeting of diplomats from various countries represented in South Africa. Among those invited to the breakfast briefing were members of diplomatic missions accredited in Pretoria as well as members of parliament belonging to the portfolio and select committees on international relations and cooperation. Pandor says, “We have to ensure that women enjoy equality, that children have access to education and opportunities – those populations do not suffer from civil conflict or cross border conflict, that communities don’t experience hunger. That those who don’t enjoy freedom get it. That those who don’t have territory get land.” Watch related video:
