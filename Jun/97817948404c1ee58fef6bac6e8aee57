The centre for the AIDS programme in South Africa says HIV new infections among homosexual men and transgender persons seems to be increasing drastically world-wide. The study further shows that HIV infection rates among young girls between the ages of 19 and 24 years old remains the highest in Southern Africa. The studies were presented to the more than three-thousand delegates attending the four day 9th AIDS Conference in Durban. Director of the Center – Prof Abdool Karrim says despite huge efforts made in HIV treatment, the world still lags behind in preventing HIV/AIDS. “We need to do better – there is still much that needs to be done. We are doing hopelessly poorly in terms of prevention and in terms of reducing the number of new HIV infections occurring in the world. HIV new infections in young black men who have sex with men continues to increase. This is a deeply concerning reality that even in the midst of success you have these dub groups where it continues to be a challenge.” Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says the stigma attached to HIV /AIDS is still a major concern which discourages many people to get tested. Mkhize was speaking at the launch of the Promotion of Human Rights Programme which is aimed at educating all South Africans about the importance of human rights. Mkhize and KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala also visited the Gugu Dlamini Park in remembrance of Gugu Dlamini who was killed in 1998 in KwaMashu after disclosing her HIV status. Watch for more:
