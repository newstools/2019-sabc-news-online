The Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State have attributed the lack of security at healthcare facilities to poor governance in the province.  Last week, two doctors were attacked at the Pelonomi Hospital. In the first incident, a 24-year-old intern doctor escaped an attempted rape after biting off her attacker’s tongue. On Saturday morning, a 44-year-old female doctor was held at gunpoint and robbed off her cellphone at the hospital. The EFF and DA are demanding urgent action.
