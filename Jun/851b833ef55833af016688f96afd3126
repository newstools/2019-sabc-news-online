Former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer (COO) Angelo Agrizzi has agreed to apologise for his racist remarks during a private conversation in his home with Gavin Watsonâ€™s children. Agrizzi used the K-word several times in an audio recording played at the State Capture Commission prompting the Human Rights Commission to open a crimen injuria case against him. The Equality Court sitting in Randburg, north of Johannesburg, has heard that the Commission and Agrizzi have now agreed to settle the matter. Lawyers for both Angelo Agrizzi and the SA Human Rights Commission met and agreed to the following terms: The apology was drafted and then pre-approved by the Commission. Agrizzi will also pay an amount of R200 000 to an organization in Alexandra that promotes social cohesion, justice and reconciliation.
