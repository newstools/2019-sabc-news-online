The Barkly West Magistrateâ€™s court in the Northern Cape has postponed the sentencing procedure of a 43 year- old man found guilty of manufacturing and distributing pornographic material. Roelof Petrus Du Toit has appointed a new lawyer after his legal representative withdrew from the case. Du Toit was arrested in January 2014 after an American police agent, posed as a 15 year-old started communicating with him via e-mail. He is faced with nine charges involving the rape of two boys, as well as using them to create child pornography. His case was removed from the court roll due to the absence of witnesses in 2016. He however pleaded guilty and was convicted accordingly two months ago. Du Toit is expected to be sentenced on the 13 of June
