The African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will contest by-elections on Ward 3 of the Emakhazeni Local Municipality in Mpumalanga on Wednesday.

We have got the ANC and their candidate is Emily Sonto Radebe and we also have EFF and their candidate is Lindiwe Hlatshwayo. The by-elections are actually in Ward 3 in Emakhazeni.
