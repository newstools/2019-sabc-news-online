President Emmerson Mnangagwa has told the United Nations wildlife summit currently underway in Victoria Falls, that the lifting of the ban will enable his country to sell $600-million worth of stockpiled tusks. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia have all cited the growing number of elephants in some areas in their bid to have the ban lifted, angering many conservationists. “We call upon the institution to resist the temptation of being a policy institution and instead be a developmental one which promotes the intricate balance between conservation and sustainable utilisation of all wildlife resources.” Namibia president Hage Geingob says it’s concerning that it seems that the west is more worried of the right of animals versus the rights of human beings, especially in developing countries.
