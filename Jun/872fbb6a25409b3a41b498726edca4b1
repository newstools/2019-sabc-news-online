Gauteng Human Settlements, Urban Planning and COGTA MEC, Lebogang Maile, has requested for anyone with information on the alleged misappropriation of funds – meant for the Alexandra Renewal Project – to come forward. Maile was briefing the media in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg on Sunday – after the project came under the spotlight amid the #TotalShutdown protests in April. The project was launched by government in 2001 and was aimed at changing the infrastructure and economy of the township. “Given the information that we have provided on how the money was spent on the Alexandra renewal project, anyone who might have contrary information – we encourage you to come forward and approach their nearest police stations and the law enforcement agencies. If such allegations are true – that there were misappropriation of funds, we are not going to protect anyone. We are going to descend on anyone who is implicated in corruption, if there is any, like a ton of bricks. We want to make sure that we account for every little cent,” says Maile.
