The Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have echoed the statement of South Africans across the country that less talk and more action can fix the country’s economy. This comes ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday evening. This as unemployment soars to 27,6%. DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the EFF’s Floyd Shivambu had this to say. “Tonight really we must get to business. It can’t just be more talk, it can’t be summits, it can’t be, it has to be real reforms. We have to talk about jobs in our country. Many young people are unemployed and 10-million of our citizens cannot find work,” says Maimane. The president must be more firm in terms of the alternate expropriation of land without compensation, but there’re lots of issues that must be dealt with more importantly. The issue of economic growth because the economy is currently in recession. There are no jobs and there’s a crisis. So the issues must be dealt with in that fashion,” says Shivambu.
