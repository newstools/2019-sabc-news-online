The City of Johannesburg has approved a debt relief programme for residents who are struggling to pay off accumulated debt to the city. The city council says qualifying customers can get up to 50% of their debt written off if they come forward. They have been asked to visit their nearest municipal offices. MMC of Finance in the city of Johannesburg, Funzela Ngobeni says the move is aimed at ensuring that defaulting customers are brought back into good standing on their municipal accounts. He says: “The programme aims to give qualifying customers 50% debt written off.” “This only applies to customers who comply with all requirements of the programme which include among others keeping the current account up to date and allowing a regular inspection of metered services. “
