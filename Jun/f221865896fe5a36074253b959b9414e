The Freedom Front Plus has threatened to write to the government of Denmark to request it to expel South Africa’s ambassador to that country, Zindzi Mandela. This as the International Relations Department investigates the nature of Mandela’s recent tweets about the land issue. FF Plus leader, Pieter Groenewald says they will write the letter if the department does not take satisfactory action against Mandela. “I will then write a letter to the Prime Minister of Denmark, asking whether they are satisfied because you must also remember that countries in which a person is an ambassador, they have a final say whether they accept the ambassador from another country.” “In this case, the government of Demark must make a decision whether they think that she is a suitable ambassador to be an ambassador in their country. I will follow up with them if we are not satisfied with the ruling of South Africa.”
