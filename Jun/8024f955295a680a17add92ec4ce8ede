The South African Communist Party ( SACP) has joined calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the Public Protector. The Democratic Alliance (DA) also wants an inquiry into Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office after several scathing judgments against her reports. The SACP was addressing a media briefing in Johannesburg after its central committee meeting on Sunday. Mkhwebane’s report on the Estina Dairy Project was severely criticised as were her reports on the Reserve Bank and its mandate and ABSA. In the judgments, Mkhwebane has been described as inept or incompetent in executing her duties. “Unfortunately the office of the Public Protector instead of being pre-occupied with defending the poor and vulnerable against such has become an instrument of the better off in society to fight political and other battles. It is for these reasons that the SACP is seriously concerned about the constant scathing court judgments against the current Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The SACP therefore believes that it is imperative for parliament to carry out an inquiry into her suitability to hold this office,” says SACP General Secretary, Dr Blade Nzimande. On the Reserve Bank debacle, the SACP says economic challenges required sober discussion and debate. It was referring to ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule’s report back on the African National Congress’ (ANC) lekgotla. Magashule’s statement that the ANC had decided to change the Reserve Bank’s mandate rattled markets and also spooked current and potential investors. Although it’s a 2017 ANC resolution, the resolution makes clear that it was left to government how to implement bank changes. The SACP believes there are deeper agendas at play. WATCH BELOW:
