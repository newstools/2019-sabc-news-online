Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip in Parliament John Steenhuisen says his party will be a constructive opposition in the 6th Parliament and will not oppose for the sake of being an opposition. Steenhuisen spoke in an interview with SABC News in Parliament. He says the DA will work with any party in Parliament including the African National Congress (ANC), when necessary. “I think that we have a good opportunity to give the governing party a few lessons in this Parliament. They have come back weaker than they were before. It obviously means that they are going to struggle in this Parliament. But what we are going to do is to be a constructive opposition, not just to oppose for opposition sake. If there are proposals from whichever party in the House, that we believe are good for South Africa and good for the people of South Africa; whether they are from the ANC, the EFF, the Freedom Front Plus or the UDM, we will support those,” says Steenhuisen
