The majority of African National Congress (ANC) branches in eThekwini region have rejected a task team announced by the party’s KwaZulu-Natal leadership. They are also demanding the reinstatement of eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede. She was asked to temporarily step down, pending the outcome of a corruption case against her. Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli met with the branches on Wednesday to inform them about their interim regional leadership, which is set to be led by ANC Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) member Kwazi Mshengu, who is also the ANC Youth League Provincial Chairperson. The meeting, however, turned into a platform where branches vented their anger. The ANC members say they expected the provincial leadership to speed up the process of convening a regional conference instead of disbanding their regional leadership. While they seem comfortable with some provincial leaders appointed to the task team, they are unhappy about others. Ntuli has promised to table the branches’ concerns to the party’s provincial working committee meeting on Sunday. The appointment of the task team followed the disbandment of the Regional Executive Committee (REC) on June 9.  Click below for more on the story:
