More than 200 learners attending a winter school programme at Motse Maria high School in Ga-Mashashane outside Polokwane have been taken to hospitals after falling ill. The Department of Education says the learners are complaining of stomach cramps. Department spokesperson Sam Makondo says they are receiving treatment at various hospitals in Polokwane. “We learnt with concern and shock this morning that 215 girls from Motse Maria high school started complaining about cramps and discomfort in the stomach. At this stage we do not know for certain what is the cause and we hope medical tests will help in revealing the root cause and that necessary steps are taken in preventing it from escalating or affecting learners in future. So far 30 learners have been released and our medical facilities are doing what they can to attend to each and every learner.”
