The High Court in Pretoria has sentenced two former Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) leaders to life and 25 years imprisonment respectively. Simphiwe Silwane has been sentenced to life for murder, while Samkelo Mkhutshwa received an effective 25 years jail term for attempted murder. They’ve been convicted of murdering Mveliso Biyela and attempting to assassinate Malibongwe Mdazo and another man in July 2017 in Marikana near Rustenburg in North West. This was sparked by infightings in Amcu over leadership positions. Ndazo, who survived after being  shot eight times, has welcomed the sentence. “I am happy because they wanted to kill me but now they are going to jail. This is a good message to those who intend to kill people, they should be prepared to leave their families and spend the rest of their lives in jail.” Judge Bert Bam also sentenced them to 15 and five years each imprisonment for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition as well as conspiracy to commit murder. Eleven of their co-accused were acquitted due to lack of evidence during the trial.
