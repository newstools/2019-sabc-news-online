Six people have died and 14 others sustained critical injuries in separate crashes on Eastern Cape roads. Provincial Department of Transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose says the crashes are believed to be caused by alcohol consumption and reckless driving. Binqose has urged motorists to be extra cautious. “We understand that our roads are busy, there are a lot of people on the roads, it’s month end and its weekend and we know that down here in the Eastern Cape it is also that time of the year when the boys are coming from the mountain. So we will have a lot of people on the road  and unfortunately and some of them would have consumed alcohol and we wish them that our traffic officers will be on the ground ensuring that everybody who is travelling on our roads is safe.” In another accident, four people have died during a head-on collision involving two vehicles on the R546 road between the Charl Cilliers settlement and eMalahleni in Mpumalanga. Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison spokesperson  Moeti Mmusi says they are investigating the cause of the crash. Mmusi has called on motorists to be vigilant on the road.
