Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, says he will establish a war room, consisting of role-players from all spheres of government as well as various law enforcement agencies to deal with the issues which passenger rail services are facing in the Western Cape. Mbaulula travelled by train from Khayelitsha to Langa on the Cape Flats to get a first-hand experience of what the daily struggles of commuters are. The central line, which he travelled on, is notorious for acts of vandalism. Mbalula had this to say at the end of his trip at Langa station. “War room will look at security issues. We need to beef up security in the trains. War room will have community elements. Commuters will talk to communities to come to the party, but over and above we must arrest and deal with the criminal element and chase them, but then we must upgrade the rail stock, which is what we are doing. They must be upgraded, but we must bring in the new ones.” Click on video below:
