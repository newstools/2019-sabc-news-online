The Ikamvalesizwe Institute at Mbizana in the Eastern Cape says it will continue to rescue initiates from illegal initiation schools around the province. The institute has rescued more than 100 initiates since the beginning of the winter initiation season. Seven have so far lost their lives. Ikamvalesizwe founder, Ayanda Nqeketho says the centre works with health officials to ensure lives are saved. “There are about 41 initiates that are here to date. They are here because we are still not happy with their health condition. Once we are happy with the health condition, we have an exit strategy in terms of taking them home. We liaising with initiation forum of their respective areas through their traditional leaders. Once we are happy, we hand them over to their traditional leaders who will hand them over to their parents,” explains Nqeketho. A local chief, Funisile Mlindazwe, believes this will save the circumcision custom. “This is very helpful in saving the lives of our children. This also assists us in keeping this custom safe because we cannot give them back to their parents in this condition. This also ensures they finish this custom in an initiation school,” says Mlindazwe.
