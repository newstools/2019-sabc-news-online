Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has expressed shock and concern over the way in which learners handle conflict situations, which in some cases results in fatalities. This after a 19-year-old school pupil was accused of murdering his schoolmate earlier this week. The learner from Forest High School in Turffontein, Johannesburg, is alleged to have stabbed three fellow learners – killing one of them. A case of murder and two of attempted murder have been opened. Lesufi says the country’s future leaders should refrain from violence and promote peaceful resolutions. “I am still shocked. You can’t get used to handing over a death certificate instead of a matric certificate. These are learners that need to be guided. These are the future leaders of the country, future economists of the country, and these are people who have to shape the country. If they are involved in this kind of violence we should be worried that the future is not that bright and we should do everything in our power to work at eliminating this new culture that I have termed ‘madness’. It is complete madness.” Click on audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/697596">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on video below:
