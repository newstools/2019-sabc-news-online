One suspect is in police custody following what the SABC believes to be an assassination attempt on its Chief Audit Executive, Thami Zikode, on Friday night. The man was injured when Zikode shot back during the attack. Other suspects fled. A firearm was recovered at the scene and the getaway car was later found near Southgate in Johannesburg. Zikode was followed by a car when he left the SABC’s head office in Auckland Park on Friday night, and upon his arrival at his gate the assailants started shooting at his car. He was not harmed. The incident was reported at Moffat View police station and is now a subject of a police investigation.
