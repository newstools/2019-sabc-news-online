Another cold front is expected to make landfall on Wednesday evening in Cape Town. Residents of Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats, whose dwellings are waterlogged following Tuesday night’s heavy downpours, say they need adequate housing. Formal and informal areas were affected with reports of flooding in Langa, Manenberg, Mitchells Plain and Imizamo Yethu. Resident, Viwe Mthintsilana says every time they experience bad weather conditions, all they get is blankets when they need proper houses. “I have a six-weeks-old child and a seven-year-old child and this child didn’t go to school because it was raining and it was lot of water flooding outside. The government must do something for us, even if they organise houses for us. They asked for votes from us and we gave them, they must return the favour to us.”
