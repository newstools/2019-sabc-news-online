Former President Thabo Mbeki says those who have made accusations that he was involved in arms deal corruption must present concrete evidence.  He was speaking to the South African Broadcasting Corporation on a range of issues.  Corruption Watch and Right2Know have asked the High Court in Pretoria to set aside the Seriti Commission’s findings that found no evidence of corruption. Judgment has been reserved on the matter.  Mbeki says he welcomes the court application by the civil society organisations. “Let’s wait and see what the court says. We’ve been arguing this thing for decades. People, who say there was grand corruption, let them produce evidence of this grand corruption. But nobody produces any evidence of any kind. If they did even now with this application that was made quite correctly I support that, but again there was no new evidence presented to demonstrate that we stole anything. “
