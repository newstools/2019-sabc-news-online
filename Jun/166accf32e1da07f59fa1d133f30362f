The Democratic Alliance (DA) has given former African National Congress (ANC) MP Bathabile Dlamini 48 hours to report to the police following allegations of corruption contained in her resignation letter or they will lay criminal charges against her. The DA already wants the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) consider whether Dlamini should be prosecuted for allegedly lying under oath during her testimony at the inquiry into the social grants crisis. Dlamini has resigned as an MP. The DA says in her resignation letter Dlamini alleges that she is aware that wives of some ANC members were involved in seemingly dubious relationships with Cash Paymaster Services. The Post Office is now administering the payment of grants.
