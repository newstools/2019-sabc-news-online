Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has denied allegations from the public that she’s harassing Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan – saying she only probes individuals once she receives complaints about them. This comes after she served Gordhan with a notice, inviting him to respond to allegations against him. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu, claims Gordhan lied to Parliament when he said he never met with the Gupta family members. The complaint also requests that the Public Protector probe the establishment of an investigating unit at South African Revenue Service (SARS) – labelled by some as the Rogue Unit. In a nearly 5-minute YouTube video, Mkhwebane detailed the investigations against Gordhan.  “There were allegations that I am harassing him [Gordhan] and we issued a subpoena to him requesting information about several investigations which we were conducting. It needs to be clear to South Africans that I receive complaints; I don’t go around and ask people to complain. Therefore, when I receive the complaints, I will have to approach the person who is complained against and request their side of the story,” explains the Public Protector.
