The City of Cape Town says the MyCiTi N2 Express service for commuters from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha will be unavailable until further notice. It has advised commuters to load mover points instead of monthly tickets on their MyConnect cards. Mayoral Member for Transport, Alderman Felicity Purchase, says commuters who have already bought a monthly ticket for June, will be reimbursed. She says the City is doing everything it can to negotiate a new contract. “The contract between the VOC (Vehicle Operating Companies)  in terms of the Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha into the Civic Centre Cape Town expired at midnight last night. We’ve been trying to have the contract renewed over the past two weeks. And so we are now trying to get the contract renewed so that it can operate effectively from Monday.”
