Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has served Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan with a Section 7(9) notice inviting the Minister to respond to potentially detrimental implications against him. The notice follows a complaint submitted to the Public Protector by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Deputy President Floyd Shivambu. Shivambu says Gordhan lied to Parliament when he said he never met with  Gupta family members. The complaint also asks the Public Protector to investigate the establishment of an investigating unit – labelled by some as a “Rogue Unit”, at SARS. The Public Protector’s spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says the Minister has ten working days to respond. Click audio below for full interview:
