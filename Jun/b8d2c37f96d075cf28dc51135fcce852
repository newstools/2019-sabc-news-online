South African Communist Party (SACP) First Deputy General Secretary, Solly Mapaila says the current sixth administration must consider giving public sector workers a sustainable housing scheme. He has told hundreds of National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) members at Boksburg in Gauteng that it is a shame that many public sector workers struggle to get decent houses. Mapaila says a consultative process will take place among all public sector unions regarding the Public Investment Corporation’s possible role in addressing the matter. “There is no basis why we should have what you call sometimes – the missing middle – that public sector workers don’t qualify for bonds from the commercial banks, don’t get state provision for what we call RDP or our social security through the RDP houses.  So they hang in the middle,” Mapaila emphasises.
