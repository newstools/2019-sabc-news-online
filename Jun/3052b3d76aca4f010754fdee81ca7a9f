Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola, says he will be tightening security at all courts across the country. Lamola visited the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday morning following Wednesday’s gang-related fight that took place in the court’s corridors. More than 20 members of the rival Varardos and Fast Guns gangs from Westbury attacked each other ahead of the appearances of their leaders Keenan Ebrahim and Leroy Brown on two separate murder cases. Lamola visited the court to assess the situation and speak to employees to find out how such a violent incident was allowed to happen. He says that there was a lapse in judgement from the side of the NPA when compiling Wednesday’s court roll, as they failed to foresee a possible altercation by having both the rival gang bosses appear in the same court on the same day. Leader of the Fast Guns, Keenan Ebrahim is currently out on bail, while Leroy Brown, the leader of the Varados remains in custody. Watch a related video below:
