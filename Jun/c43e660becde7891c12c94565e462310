President Cyril Ramaphosa has shared his vision of turning South Africaâ€™s economy around with business communities in Osaka, Japan. The President is leading a high-powered delegation that includes the Minister of Finance and the International Relations. He also put a strong case for international business to invest in the continent of Africa.  Ramaphosa is the only head of state on the African continent that is part of the G20 Summit. His presentation speaks to not only the needs of South Africa, but of the entire continent. The current trade war between China and US presents Africa with the opportunity to present itself as an alternative market. The President, as the incoming Chair of the AU, made the case for Africa. He is hoping that his engagement will result into concrete outcomes in terms of investment in South Africa. Next week, Ramaphosa will attend the AU meeting where heads of state and governance in Niger will grapple with the implementation of the African Free Trade Area Agreement that will bring together African countries as one market of more than one billion people, accounting for more than $4 trillion in spending and investment.
