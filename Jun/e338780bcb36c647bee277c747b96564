The Reserve Bankâ€™s Shiwa Mazibuko has told the state capture commission in Johannesburg that the central bank froze the accounts of the Gupta linked company, Homix, which was said to have facilitated a transaction between Transnet and Neotel. Mazibuko says Homix accounts were frozen after it was reported by Mercantile Bank for suspicious cross border transactions. Homix had exported R51 million in an unusually short space of time. The commission also heard that Homix was irregularly paid over R40 million in consulting fees regarding the Transnet-Neotel deal. Mazibuko says the Reserve Bank had to act. Meanwhile, former Transnet Group Treasurer Mathane Makgatho told the commission that she resigned from the State Owned Enterprise because she felt the toxic environment was beginning to take its toll on her health. Makgatho said she was also afraid that she would be physically harmed because she was told there were meetings in which she was described as a stumbling block. She said then Transnet CEO Brian Molefe seemed to consider her as troublesome. Click below to watch related video:
