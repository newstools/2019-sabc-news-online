The Vaal University of Technology (VUT) has been shut down. The institution has postponed exams to next week due to a workers’ strike at the main campus in Vanderbijlpark. Staff has been protesting since Wednesday morning demanding a 10% salary increase. They had blocked the university’s main entrance. VUT spokesperson Mike Khuboni says management will meet on Wednesday afternoon to discuss what they can afford to offer the striking employees. “We are going to be analysing the three scenarios that we are going to propose to the unions. We expect that by tomorrow (Thursday) morning we will definitely have the first meeting with union leaders to give the position of the university managers and we will take it from there. The exams, which were going to be written today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday), as well as on Friday, we postponed those exams to actually make sure that there is no disturbance. We arrived at an amicable solution with the unions.”
