Walter Sisulu University (WSU) convocation president, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, has led the process of signing a pledge that will ensure that there will be no violent protests taking place at the university. The convocation, institution management and the Student Representative CouncilÂ (SRC) met in East London for the signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) amid the on-going disruptive strike at the Queenstown campus and the closing of the Zamukulungisa campus in Mthatha. Ngcukaitobi says, through the signing of the pledge, protests at the institution will be curbed. He further says that protests have created a bad name for the institution and he hopes all parties involved will comply with the contents of the MOU. Students have vowed to stick to the pledge and say they are happy with the pledge as they hope it will allow for more meaningful engagements with management. WSU Spokesperson, Yonela Tukwayo, says the institution is looking forward to implementing the resolution and future engagements. In the last protest, three cars belonging to the institution were torched in Mthatha. This adds to the hundreds of thousands of rands lost through repairs of destroyed infrastructure during protests. This pledge will hopefully mark a new dawn for the institution.
