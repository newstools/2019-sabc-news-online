War of words have erupted between the Department of Health in the Free State and HIV/AIDS NGO, Positive Action Campaign. This follows a report from University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation Research indicating that 21.3%  of HIV positive South Africans, almost a quarter, live in the Free State. The department has denied the statistics stating that the numbers are for the people who have been living with the disease but not knowing their status. The organisation accuses the department of failing to provide quality healthcare, especially for people living with the pandemic. The organisation says it is irresponsible for the department to say the HIV numbers are not increasing.
