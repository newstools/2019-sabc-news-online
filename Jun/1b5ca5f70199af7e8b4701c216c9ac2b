Civil rights organization, AfriForum, has called on International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor to recall and dismiss South Africa’s Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela. This follows a series of tweets, allegedly posted by Zindzi Mandela, using the hashtag “OurLand”. AfriForum describes the posts as extremely divisive and racist. Deputy CEO of AfriForum, Alana Bailey, says the duty of an ambassador is to convey the image of a healthy and united country to gain the confidence of political partners and investors. Bailey says in the posts, Mandela displayed a rancorous attitude towards white South Africans in the country and in a very public arena, contributed to the division of local communities.
