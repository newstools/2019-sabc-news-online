The hate speech case against former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer (COO), Angelo Agrizzi, resumes in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court sitting as the Equality Court in Johannesburg on Thursday. The case was brought by the Human Rights Commission after an audio recording played at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in which Agrizzi is heard allegedly using the K-word several times during a conversation. During the previous hearing, the Equality Court asked the lawyers for Agrizzi and the Commission to sit around the table and negotiate a settlement agreement. The Commission’s Buang Jones says the parties met earlier in June and the outcomes of the meeting will be presented before the  court on Thursday. Watch a related video below:
