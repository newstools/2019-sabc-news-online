Rand Water says it is currently upgrading its pipeline at its Vereeniging Purification Plant and the drainage is proceeding according to plan. Rand Water shut down its B11 pipeline in Vereeniging at 6am on Monday morning. Residents have been urged to use water sparingly so that the reservoirs last the 54 hours given period. “We eclipsed our first milestone in terms of the drainage. We are progressing very well. The plan was that at least by 22:30 tonight  (Monday) we will have completed draining the line. We are talking about here a 12km pipe with a diameter of 2500mm. From five o’clock in the morning until now it’s been the drainage of the line and so far we are happy with the progress,” says Rand Water Spokesperson, Eddy Singo.
