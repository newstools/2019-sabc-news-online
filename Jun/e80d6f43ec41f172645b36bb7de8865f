The Democratic Alliance (DA) Youth says there is nothing for young people in the country to celebrate after 25 years of democracy.  It accuses government of neglecting young people by failing to create job opportunities for them. Dozens of DA Youth members laid a wreath at the Hector Peterson Monument in Orlando West, Soweto on Sunday morning to commemorate National Youth Day. This as part of the 43rd commemoration celebrations of the June 16 Soweto Student Uprisings. DA National spokesperson, Refiloe Nts’ekhe, has urged government to emulate what the party is doing to empower young people throughout the country. Nts’ekhe emphasised that the DA have managed to provide jobs for young people where the DA governs. The event was attended by DA Youth leaders, Luyolo Mphithi and Makashule Gana and dozens of DA youth members. Watch a related video below:
