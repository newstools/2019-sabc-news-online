GOOD party leader Patricia de Lille has called on all party leaders to rise above any political differences and instead unite to grow the country’s economy. This follows Statistics South Africa’s announcement on Wednesday that consumer price inflation (CPI) rose by 0.1% in May 2019, but remained below average inflation since 2017. An increase in the fuel price is believed to be the reason behind consumer price inflation increasing. De Lille was speaking in Parliament where President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver his State of the Nation Address (SONA). “Every single department must make sure we see how we can use our assets. How do we use assets to make a contribution to stimulate economic growth in our country? We must help the economy to grow. We must make sure that we deal with the issue of Eskom. We must create more jobs for young people. So, we have to work to together. We might have some policy differences. We might have political differences, but at this stage where our country is right now, it’s called upon all leaders to begin to build this country together,” says De Lille.
