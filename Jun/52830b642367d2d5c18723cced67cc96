The Cape Town Weather Office has issued a warning of a series of cold fronts and gale force winds from Friday afternoon in the Western Cape.  Senior forecaster Thabisile Nhleko says heavy rains are also expected on Saturday morning with possible thunderstorms. “We might get some winds merging from 60 to 80 kilometres per hour with possible gails of up to 90 to 100 kilometres per hour, that’s mainly places over the interior of the Western Cape and some places over the cape metro-pole into the Overberg region.” “We are also expecting a lot of cold air to move in, so the temperatures will drop significantly during the course of Saturday. We might even see some light dusting of snow in places over our Western mountains,” explains Nhleko.
