Preparations for road closures and other logistical matters are forging ahead for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address  (SONA) on Thursday evening. President Ramaphosa’s speech will mark the beginning of the sixth democratic administration. The joint sitting of the two Houses will be accompanied by the usual ceremony that includes a military guard of honour. Capetonians are warned that access to several roads, including Roeland, Plein and Adderly streets among others, will be restricted from five in the afternoon on Tuesday and Wednesday. This is to allow the Defence Force an opportunity to conduct rehearsals for SONA. The President’s speech is expected to address among others, the country’s dire economic situation and outline his plans to get the economy growing again. Belt tightening will see Parliament do away with some of the traditional aspects. These include doing away with the junior guard and the civil guard, who usually form a guard of honour for the State procession. The eminent persons, who are usually selected from provinces on the basis of their outstanding achievements in their respective fields of work, have also not been included this time around.
