Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called for the immediate release of the Public Protector’s report on President Cyril Ramaphosa and Bosasa. Maimane says he will write to Busisiwe Mkhwebane, requesting that she release the full underacted report in the next 48 hours, to prevent further leaks and speculation. He says the release of the report is six months overdue from the time he lodged a complaint with the Public Protector following Ramaphosa’s explanation in Parliament in November last year about Bosasa’s  R 500 000 donation to his 2017 campaign to become African National Congress (ANC) president. He later admitted that the money had been received from Bosasa through his son. Watch related video below for more on the story:
