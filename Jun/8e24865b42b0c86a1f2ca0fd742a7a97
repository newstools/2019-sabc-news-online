An Eskom employee has been arrested for soliciting a R30 000 bribe in Randburg, north of Johannesburg. The 32-year-old technician was nabbed after Eskom alerted the Hawks. He will appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of corruption on Friday. “The matter was reported to Eskom, who then sent it to us immediately and then on Wednesday we managed to have an operation where we arrested the suspect as and when he accepted a R10 000 bribe” says Hawks Spokesperson, Hangwani Mulaudzi.
