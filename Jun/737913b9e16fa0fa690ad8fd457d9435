Pretoria police have confirmed that they have found yet another body believed to be that of a homeless person. This is the fourth body found in Pretoria in the on-going case where police suspect a serial killer could be involved. In the past few weeks, bodies of homeless men bludgeoned and stabbed repeatedly to death, have been discovered around Magnolia Dell Park in Muckleneuk. Police spokesperson Daniel Mavimbela says, “This morning we’ll be moving again to finalise the setting up of a task team that will be solely focussed on these recent killings of homeless people.” Click on audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/701280">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
