Residents of Bloemfontein are demanding an immediate clean-up of the city. They are complaining of filthy living conditions due to waste collection challenges. They are also aggrieved about sewage spillages and rampant crime. The Mangaung Metro wants to reclaim the city. However, not everyone is happy with the Metro’s tough approach. Informal trader, Moleboheng Phiri, has accused municipal officials of harassment. “I have been trading here for the past two months, but municipal officials have been harassing us saying we are trading illegally. We are only doing business here. We don’t do crime so they must give us a place where we can trade.” Mangaung Metro Spokesperson, Qondile Khedama, says tough measures are envisaged to restore investor confidence in the city. “We are dealing with people who are parking in areas where they are not supposed to. We are dealing with old buildings that do not adhere to regulations. We are dealing with waste management where people are just taking or disposing waste where it’s not allowed and we are dealing with crime. Remember that we have a number of cases in the CBD where crime is involved so this integrated programme makes it very easy for us to attend to every aspect of the city.” The Mangaung Metro is adamant the clean-up campaign will continue.
