A top committee of the World Health Organisation (WHO) will convene on Friday in Geneva, Switzerland, to consider whether the current Ebola outbreak in central Africa constitutes a global health crisis. This comes after a five-year-old boy who travelled with his family to Uganda from the DRC, died from the disease. The Ugandan authorities later confirmed that a second person – the boy’s grandmother – also died. The UN Secretary General’s Spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric says: “With cases of Ebola now confirmed in Uganda, the World Health Organisation is reconvening the Emergency Committee on International Health Regulations – that meeting will take place tomorrow (Friday) in Geneva. The meeting’s objective will be to ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. This will be the third meeting of the committee since the outbreak in the DRC. As of this morning (Thursday), the DRC’s most recent number of cases stands at 2084 with 1405 deaths and as of this morning Uganda authorities have reported two deaths linked to Ebola.” Click on videos below:
