Political Analyst Levy Ndou says the success of the current ANC leadership will be determined by its implementation of its resolutions taken at Nasrec. Ndou was speaking on Morning Live, following Tuesday’s post SONA debate in Parliament. He says he was impressed to see opposition MPs not only criticising the ruling party, but also providing tangible solutions on how to fast-track the implementation of certain policies. On Tuesday, Members of Parliament debated President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) staged a walk out in the National Assembly just before Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan began speaking.   The red berets have previously accused President Ramaphosa of undermining Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane following her finds against Minister Gordhan.   Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of improper conduct after he granted an early retirement pay out for former South African Revenue Service (SARS) deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.   EFF leader Julius Malema labelled Gordhan a ‘constitutional delinquent’ and demanded he not be allowed to speak.   Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane told Ramaphosa to stop thinking about building new cities, but to rather improve the current urban centres which are faced by challenges. Maimane has also urged Ramaphosa to tackle challenges faced by Prasa and to improve the train service in the country.   President Ramaphosa will respond to the SONA debate on Wednesday afternoon.
