Taxi operators have started queuing at the Gauteng Transport Department’s offices in Johannesburg for their minibus-taxis to be vetted before they can be allowed to operate on the disputed Soweto routes. Taxi operators from rival Soweto associations WATA and NANDUWE were stopped from operating on some of the routes and had their ranks closed in March this year, due to violent clashes between members which claimed the lives of three people. The parties signed a peace deal last week Tuesday in which the groups pledged to end all hostilities. The department says minibus-taxis which will be allowed to operate will first have to be vetted to ensure they have operating licences before being issued with identification stickers. WATA spokesperson Mandlenkosi Maphalala says, “Unfortunately the process is slow. I don’t know what the reason behind is. We are still waiting to get confirmation and stickers and go back and operate. We are pleading with everyone to be calm and co-operate. We are here in business and not to fight. Fighting will not take us anywhere.” Click on audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/700758">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
