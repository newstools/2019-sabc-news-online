Two children have died at a Westdene pre-school in Johannesburg after allegedly eating rat poison found on the school’s premises. It’s alleged that the children were under the care and supervision of a privately-run pre-school without the necessary permits to run such a facility. It’s also alleged that the Westdene area is infested with illegally run pre-schools. Johannesburg Member of the Mayoral Committee for Health and Social Development, Mpho Phalatse is this afternoon expected to visit the families of the deceased children. She’ll also visit the local police station to check on their investigations.
