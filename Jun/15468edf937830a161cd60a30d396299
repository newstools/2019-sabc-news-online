Eastern Cape Arts and Culture MEC Fezeka Bayeni says they anticipate good economic returns from the Makhanda National Arts festival, as it contributes R324-million to the national GDP and R94-million of that to the town. The Festival is officially underway. Over 700 artists will take to the stage this year. Bayeni says the festival brings many benefits. “There are a lot of economic benefits whether you look at visitors that will be coming. More than 10 000 visitors projected and obviously they’ll be seeping here, buying here, that on its own is a generation of income. Also for those who will be performing, it’s some form of a take home and economic development.” Welcome to #NAFday2! An update on extra shows, cancellations & changes.
