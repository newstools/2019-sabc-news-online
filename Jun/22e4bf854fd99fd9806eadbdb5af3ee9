As the country commemorates Youth Month, members of the “Revive ANCYL” movement took their fight to the streets of Johannesburg to demand that the current leadership of the League relinquish their positions and step down. The movement, which is composed of League members, wants to restore the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) to its former glory and they demand the current leadership of the young lions be disbanded. Spokesperson Thabo Mabotja says Youth League president Collen Maine does not serve the interests of young people. “We have been witnessing a very sad state of affairs in the ANCYL, Collen Maine has not been espousing the interests of young people.” Other young people claim that the leadership of the ANCYL does not have the interest of young people at heart. “We are calling for the disbandment of these comrades as they are not representing the ideological perspectives.” The ANC Youth League has released a statement citing financial constraints as the reason why it did not hold their elective conference in September 2018. However, ANC National Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says members of the NEC will be meeting with the current ANCYL leadership. The ANC says the issues raised by this group will be prioritised.
