The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State has blamed failing security at the country’s borders for the murder of one of its councillors and her husband. 68 year old Monica and 74 year old Basil Deniacos were found dead in their home in Dealesville, Free State, last week. Police found a blunt object in the house which apparently was used in the murder. Two Malawian nationals have been arrested in connection with the murder and are expected to appear in court on Monday. DA Free State leader Patricia Kopane has appealed to the government to introduce stricter border laws. “The DA says everybody must be documented. We need to know who are these people. Those who are illegal into our country must be taken back to their countries. Those who are legally here it is our responsibility to ensure how best we can help them,” says Kopane.
