A large police contingent deployed to Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, is busy extinguishing burning tyres and reopening blocked roads following overnight protests. Residents blockaded roads since Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning as part of the so-called total shutdown of the area. The planned demonstration follows Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashabaâ€™s promise to rebuild 80 illegal structures demolished by the Red Ants last month. In April, residents went on the rampage in protest over the mushrooming of illegal dwellings in the township. Meanwhile, the Alexandra Shutdown committee has threatened to embark on a march to Sandton later on Wednesday.  Click on the videos below:
