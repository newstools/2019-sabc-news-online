Former President Thabo Mbeki says even Patricia de Lille, the original whistle-blower on the multi-billion rand arms deal corruption did not have concrete evidence. De Lille appeared before the Seriti commission to present the De Lille dossier that landed former African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip, Tony Yengeni in jail. She tabled the arms deal dossier in Parliament as Pan Africanist Congress MP in 1999. The dossier also led to the successful prosecution of Schabir Shaik. Mbeki says De Lille admitted that she did not know more than what was contained in the dossier. “She appeared before the Seriti commission to present what is called the De Lille dossier. Then when she’s cross examined she says, I know nothing about any of the things said in this dossier, it didn’t come from me. I was given this thing by ANC MPs.  I’m really just conveying this. I cannot say this thing is right or wrong or whatever. She didn’t bring any information herself, ‘I don’t know, please investigate’.” Click below to watch related video:
