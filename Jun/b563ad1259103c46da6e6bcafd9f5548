Convicted racist Vicki Momberg‘s application and leave to appeal her conviction and sentence has been dismissed in the High Court in Johannesburg. The Court ruled that the matter has no reasonable prospects of success. Momberg was convicted on four counts of crimen injuria in the Randburg Magistrate’s court last year. She used the K-word 48 times against police officers and the police’s call centre operators after a smash-and-grab incident in 2016. She was sentenced to an effective two-year prison term and she appealed both the conviction and sentence. Watch related video:
