Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile wants answers from the Lesedi Municipality in Heidelburg, far east of Johannesburg, over the alleged irregularities in the awarding of a R50 million tender. It is alleged that the municipality’s Acting Manager Gugu Thimane flouted tender processes and supply chain management regulations when awarding the multi-million rand security tender. There’s been growing calls for the MEC to investigate the allegations. Maile says he wants to ascertain whether no impropriety or irregular conduct was done to favour a particular individual or the company. “The municipality will be asked to respond in writing to these allegations and provide all relevant information pertaining to the awarding of the tender. If the allegations are indeed true, heads must roll and those found to have acted improperly must face the brutal might of the law,” says Maile.
