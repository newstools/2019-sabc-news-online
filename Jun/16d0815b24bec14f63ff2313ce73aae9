Five premises, including offices of Limpopo Premier Stan  Mathabatha in Polokwane, have been raided as part of the Hawks’ investigations into alleged corruption related to international trips by officials. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says documents were seized from the offices, business properties and homes of suspects. He says no one has been arrested yet and investigations are continuing. “On Friday there were four private premises that we searched and then the fifth one was the supply chain of the Premier’s office. It is businesses as well as houses that we were searching for documents. We cannot elaborate more pending the investigations critical to us. Of course there was a whistle-blower who gave us information and that information is what prompted this investigation, so it is still at early stages.” The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Limpopo has welcomed the raid conducted at the Office of the Premier last Friday. Provincial chairperson Jossey Buthane however says the investigations into the alleged travel fraud attached to that office may not yield any positive results. He says previous investigations did not lead to any arrests. Buthane has accused staff of suspected travel fraud and collision with agencies when booking international trips. “We welcome the raid at the Premier’s office but we know nothing will happen. Remember the Premier’s office that is where a lot of corruption cases have been opened, that is where a lot of evidence is being provided to the Premier, there is even an internal report. He knew that there is a coalition between the travel agency people and the people in his office.”
