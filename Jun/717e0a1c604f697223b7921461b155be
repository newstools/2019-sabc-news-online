Adam Catzavelos, the man behind the k-word slur that was captured on a video clip taken on a beach in Greece could face prosecution in that country. His lawyer Lawley Shain has told the media outside the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg that they have received a letter from Greek authorities informing them of the intensions to prosecute him. Catzavelos appeared briefly in court on Thursday and will appear again on July 10 for his legal team to make representations. But the National Prosecuting Authority, (NPA) won’t confirm these developments. NPA spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwana says: “Well we don’t have such information yet as the NPA and we will liaise with the investigating officer to try and establish if those facts are true, but for we not confirm that.” The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it will support authorities in Greece on the matter. EFF Gauteng chairperson, Mandisa Mashego says such a move would be welcomed – where the international law assists the country in fighting racism. “We welcome the SAPS confirming that the Greeks have a case, who knows maybe we can fundraise and ask somebody to donate and buy us an air-ticket when he appears in a Greek court and we can sit and watch International Law and international forces help us to fight racism decisively.”
