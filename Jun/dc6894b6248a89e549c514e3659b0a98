The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape says it supports the call to rename the Cape Town suburb, Zonnebloem, back to its original name of District Six. This after the District Six Museum announced that it had set in motion a process to facilitate the renaming of the suburb. The name was changed to Zonnebloem when the then apartheid government declared District Six a whites-only area and under the 1950 Group Areas Act forcibly removed other racial groups from the area. The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Cultural Affairs in the Provincial Legislature, Reagen Allen says the restoration of the District Six name plays a crucial role in commemorating and reinstating cultural identities in the City Bowl. “The effects of forced removals and apartheid social division persists in Cape Town today and continues to cut off many residents from access to transportation, job opportunities, better living conditions and in many cases land, which is their birthright. The renaming of Zonnebloem to District Six transcends restitution efforts in that it speaks to a broader desire for people to reclaim their identities, heritage and rebuild shared spaces that were once reduced to ruins.”
