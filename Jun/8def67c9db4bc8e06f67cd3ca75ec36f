The family of a 13-year-old girl from Pampierstad in the Northern Cape, who fell pregnant after allegedly being raped by three men, have decided to keep the baby. The family says, despite the child being conceived through the rape ordeal, they have learnt to love and accept her. They are now awaiting DNA paternity results, hoping they will finally know who is the father between the trio. It’s been four months since the baby was born. Her mother, a rape survivor, has grown to accept and appreciate her. The mother’s aunt says that she has advised her niece that this is not the end of the world. “I have advised her that it is not the end of the world and she is not the first to have a child at this age. And I told her it was not her fault, but that of old people who failed to act responsibly.” The family was left in shock when they discovered that their daughter was four months pregnant as a result of a violent rape by three different men. The victim’s mother says that they have decided not to give the child up for adoption as her daughter loves her. “At first we were not okay but as time went on, we slowly recovered and ended up deciding that we will not give the child away for adoption. She loves her child, even breastfeeds her.” The three accused aged 61, 51 and 20; are currently out on bail. In February, police took swabs from them, leaving the family concerned over the long wait for the paternity test results. Police Spokesperson, Dimakatso Mooi, says that the paternity results will be used as evidence. “The results will be used as evidence. The investigating officer has taken all the tests that are required and they have been taken to the laboratory so we are just waiting on the laboratory to give us the results back.” Meanwhile, the teen mother remains at home and will only go back to school in 2020. The three accused are expected back in court on 14 June. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
