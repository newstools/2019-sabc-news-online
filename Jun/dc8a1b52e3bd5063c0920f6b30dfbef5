The State maintains that Duduzane Zuma lost control of his vehicle before crashing into a taxi resulting in the death of a taxi passenger because he was driving negligently. This emerged during closing arguments in Zuma’s culpable homicide case in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, north of Johannesburg. The former President’s son faces culpable homicide, reckless and negligent driving charges.  The case relates to the 2014 crash on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba began his closing arguments by telling the court that all the State witnesses are credible as all the evidence they provided to the court was corroborated. He also told the court that Zuma lost control of his vehicle because he was driving negligently and because he never adapted his driving to the inclement weather conditions. Zuma lost control of his Porsche 911 Turbo and crashed into a minibus-taxi resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube who was one of the passengers in the taxi at that time. Meanwhile, former President Jacob Zuma is present in court to offer his son support.
