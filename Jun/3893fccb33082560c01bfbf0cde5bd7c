The Mthatha High Court in the Eastern Cape has sentenced six gang members to three life terms and an additional 45 years each. They were convicted on 40 counts that include racketeering, murder, attempted murder, robbery and escaping from lawful custody. The trial against the men took more than eight years to conclude. All hundred witnesses testified against them. One of them, Ntlantla Mvoko, is the younger brother to notorious Sakhumzi Mvoko who was killed in a gun battle with police and prison officials during a much-publicised botched escape at the Mthatha High Court in 2014. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson Luxolo Tyali says the director of Public Prosecutions in the Mthatha, Barry Madolo commends all the witnesses that came forward.
