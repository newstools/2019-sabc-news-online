Leader of the National People’s Front (NAPF), Bheki Gumbi says his party wants to meet with Mineral Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe on the situation at the Lily Mine near Barberton in Mpumalanga. Gumbi visited former workers of the mine and family members of the three miners, whose bodies were never retrieved after they were trapped underground when the mine caved in three years ago. Gumbi says members have been camping outside the mine for more than a month now. “We are going to write a letter to Minister Mantashe. We are also going to write to the Public Protector because it is very unfair for this community that has been camping here, trying to draw the attention of those who are in leadership, but nobody is responding, (not) even the local councillor,” says Gumbi.
