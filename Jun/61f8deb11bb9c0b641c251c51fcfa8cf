President Cyril Ramaphosa will jet off to Geneva, Switzerland on Monday for the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Centenary Conference. The ILO conference will sit under the theme “Building a Better Future with Decent Work”. Ramaphosa as the co-chair of the ILO Global Commission, alongside the Swedish Prime Minister, will deliver the Future of Work Report. The Future of Work Report has made 10 recommendations guided by a human centred agenda. This agenda was launched in KZN in March this year. The ILO’s International Labour Conference takes place annually and is attended by the 187 member states, including South Africa. Ramaphosa will be accompanied by Thulas Nxesi, minister of Employment and Labour and a NEDLAC delegation.
