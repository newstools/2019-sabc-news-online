Graphic content warning Doctors at the Pelonomi hospital in Bloemfontein are demanding that the Department of Health expedite the process of beefing up security at the hospital. The doctors in solidarity with  interns handed over a memorandum of demands to the Department. This follows an attempted rape of an on duty intern doctor on Tuesday night. The doctor escaped the rape ordeal, when she bit off the perpetrator’s tongue. The culprit has since been arrested.
