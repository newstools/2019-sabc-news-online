President Cyril Ramaphosa has paid tribute to the youth of 1976, describing that generation as brave young men and women who declared a war against oppression. Addressing the national Youth Day commemoration event taking place at the Peter Mokaba Cricket Club in Polokwane, Limpopo, Ramaphosa has urged the youth of today to emulate the class of 76, and take their place in society. President Ramaphosa highlights that the youth are important  for the country. “The young people of our country have been the vanguard of our democratic revolution; it is the young people of our country who were at the sharp end, who were brave and who were courageous, who declared that they want to see their country free… and it is you the youth who have taken up the struggle of a new generation, the struggle for economic freedom, for access to land and education it is you who are the voice of our national conscience.” Large parts of Ramaphosa’s speech focused on the youth, with a sharp and particular  focus on unemployment among the youth. He said that government will make efforts to ensure that work experience is no longer a pre-requisite when young people apply for jobs. Ramaphosa further urged the youth to take advantage of the various resources which have been made available by government which look to empower the youth. Meanwhile,  Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha says the students who were killed in the Soweto uprising in 1976 died so that the youth of today can live without the limitations of apartheid. Mathabatha says the youth of today must also be courageous and fearless to fulfill their mission.
