Meteorologist Azwitakadzi Tuwani says the kind of weather that is being experienced in the in Western Cape is not unusual, but that the storms are more severe this year. Climate change scientists have warned of intensifying weather patterns as human activity results in more greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. The Western Cape Province has been lashed by strong winds and rains in the past 24 hours leading to road closures and flooding in parts of the province. Tuwani says high winds were recorded. “We are talking of gust winds of 92 km/h, wind speed going to 100km/h… Now that is too much for even a season like this, or any other season that may be. Again a lot of rainfall, flooding has happened and rooftops have been taken off as well, this is due to that severe cold front that we have received but its severity only set along the coastal regions and mostly the Western Cape slightly to the Eastern Cape.” Meanwhile, teams from the City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management are carrying out mopping up operations following a cold front that brought heavy rains. Spokesperson, Charlotte Powell, says they’ve received numerous reports of flooded roadways. Powell says some roofs were blown off in areas like Belhar and Strand. “Using specialised equipment, Recreation and Parks department removed five trees that were blown over in Woodbury road in Kenwyn. Five informal structures have been destroyed by wind in Freedom Farm, Valhalla Park. Other city departments are continuing with mopping up operations throughout the metropole.” WATCH BELOW:
