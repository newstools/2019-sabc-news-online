Corporate watchdog, the Benchmark Foundation, has lambasted Lanxess Chrome mine for failing to provide essential food and water to 294 mineworkers, who embarked on an underground sit-in at the mine’s operations near Rustenburg in the North West. Security officials have apparently refused to accept food or water that family members have provided. The foundation’s David van Wyk says, “I am very worried about the workers underground, simply because there might be some of them who are on chronic medication. You know among mine workers that is frequently the case.” He adds: “This means they don’t have access to that chronic medication. So you can also have deterioration of the health of some of those workers as well. So those workers should insist that they should be allowed to get access to food and water.” Watch related videos below:
