The Department of International Relations (Dirco) has welcomed a decision by the African Union’s Peace and Security Council to suspend Sudan from all African Union activities with immediate effect. The suspension comes after members of a paramilitary unit shot dead dozens of protestors in Sudan’s capital Khartoum. A civilian-led transitional authority is currently in place. The announcement of the suspension followed an emergency meeting by the African Unions (AU) over the crisis. “We are calling on the military council to exercise restraint and protect the lives of the people of Sudan as well as property.  We are also calling on the role players to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to resolve the security and political challenges facing that country. We take note of the decision of the AU Peace and Security Council and we align ourselves with that,” says Dirco’s Head of Public Diplomacy Clayson Monyela.
