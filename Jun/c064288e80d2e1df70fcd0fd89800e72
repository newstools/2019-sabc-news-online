The Head of the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education – Dr. Enock Nzama – has challenged universities to ensure that young people are able to study in fields that are in demand in the job market. Nzama was addressing the official opening of three new buildings at the University of KwaZulu Natal’s Edgewood Campus in Pinetown. The three buildings are named after struggle icons and educators, Ellen Khuzwayo, Phyllis Naidoo and Dulcie September. Nzama has encouraged universities to produce educators for technical subjects… “I’m challenging universities to please begin to align themselves with the labour market. What is required with the skills that are required by the Department of education in line the new subjects introduced by the Basic education department, so that when we look for skills at they are in abundance available, and we are able to introduce these subjects at the go. Therefore we are urging all universities to begin to align themselves with the developments in the sector, that is in terms of aligning themselves with the skills that are required in response to the labour market.” UKZN’s Dean and Head of the School of Education – Professor Thabo Msibi – says the spaces were named after black women to recognise their role in the liberation of the country. “Women educators played a profoundly important role in the liberation movement, and often then the narrative that we often get is very much biased towards men. So we thought in the process of decolonising our universities we opt to ensure that the important voice of recognition of women actually is included as the narrative around the liberation movement, and also so that we can educate our young women and young men of the importance of having women in the society and the important role they played in the liberation of the country.”
