With unemployment raging, 150 youth from rural areas of Mpumalanga have graduated with skills in clothing manufacture. SETA has invested about R3 million for youth skills development. The country’s unemployment rate is a staggering 27%. It’s a tale magnified across the country – matriculated, but jobless. Mbongeni and Sandisile Mabota had little money and few options until they started training in clothing manufacture. Mbongeni says that he has been jobless since matriculating in 2008. “I finished matric in 2008, there were no jobs available. So at last I found this programme, this learnership. So we have trained and we started making garments and making a living.” Since their training, they have managed to build up a clientele one stitch in time. Sandisile says she wants to open her own shops. “I got A with a machine – and I’m willing to hire the youth. I want to open a big shop so that we can do much better.” Peggy Sithole from Assured Vocational Skills Training says it goes beyond just training. “We looked at the skills that will benefit this province and give jobs. Not only skill them, but also make sure they get the business skills.” The Fibre Processing and Manufacturing SETA was established in 2011 to provide training for various sectors, including clothing and footwear. Felleng Yede from the SETA says they have invested money to train young people in furniture-related skills. “We have invested I think around R3 million to train young people in furniture related type of skills. What is unique about this type of intervention is that we are not just talking about skilling them and giving them certificates; we are skilling them and making sure they are going to SME development.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
