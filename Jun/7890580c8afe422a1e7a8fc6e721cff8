A case of animal cruelty involving National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise is expected to resume on Friday morning at the Potchefstroom Regional Court in the North West. The case follows a successful private investigation conducted by civil rights organisation, Afri-Forum’s private prosecution unit on behalf of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal (NSPCA). It is alleged that Modise left her farm unattended, causing over 50 pigs and other animals to died due to lack of water and food. It is alleged that in 2014, the NSPCA received a complaint that Modise’s farm was left unattended by her workers for days. Other animals include geese, ducks, sheep, and goats which were left without food and water. Meanwhile, the SPCA had to euthanize 162 animals due to their deprived conditions. Afri-Forum says the investigations were successfully concluded and the summons have already submitted to Modise. Watch related video…
