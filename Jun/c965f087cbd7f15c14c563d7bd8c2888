South Africa Airways (SAA) says fog at the OR Tambo International Airport, resulted in Friday’s delays and diversions of a number of inbound flights. Nine flights had to be diverted to other airports. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali says the diversions further caused the airlines operating crew to run out of flight and duty time which is a legally regulated time for the crews to operate our flights. “As part of our recovery plans, we organised for new crews to operate the flights, combine certain flights after deploying wide-bodied flights that have the capacity to accommodate more passengers. We, unfortunately, had to cancel one flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg and assisted passengers affected with accommodation.” The fog comes as temperates across the country have plummeted as the winter temperatures drop.
