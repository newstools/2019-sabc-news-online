Civil society group, Corruption Watch wants a fresh probe into the country’s 1999 multi-billion rand arms deal. The organisation wants further investigations into high ranking politicians who were implicated and later exonerated. The 2016 Seriti Commission report found there was no fraud, corruption or irregularities, despite evidence of the flow of money into the country. Corruption Watch and Right2Know believe further investigations on who benefited from the funds should have been conducted. The anti-corruption NGO and Right2Know have launched a high court challenge, asking for the findings to be set aside. Speaking on Morning Live, Corruption Watch attorney Deborah Mutemwa-Tumbo says the commission failed to carry out its mandate, thus the urgent court challenge. “That act gives wide powers to a commission to investigate, to subpoena witnesses and gives them all of the powers they need – and in our view that wasn’t done in the Siriti Commission. That brings us to our submission that the findings cannot to sustained in the way that the commission was conducted.” On Tuesday, judgement was reserved in the matter, which was heard in the North Gauteng High court.
