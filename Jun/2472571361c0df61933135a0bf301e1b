The Educators Union of South Africa (EUSA) is leading calls for teachers to be allowed to carry weapons at schools. In the latest attack on an educator, a teacher was gunned down on Tuesday, at Masuku Primary School, in KwaZulu-Natal. General-Secretary of the union, Siphiwe Mpungose says government is not providing adequate protection for teachers. “We as the Educators Union of South Africa are making calls for teachers to defend themselves. This war has been waged on teachers for many years, now we are saying enough is enough.” “Teachers need to defend themselves. And ministers they keep on giving condolences and our employer is failing us. As I speak to you I was shot at with three bullets. We are not protected by our employer.” Click video below:
