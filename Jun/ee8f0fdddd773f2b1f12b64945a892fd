Four suspects accused of killing two eThekwini Metro police officers in Durban are expected to appear before the Verulam Magistrate’s Court for a bail application on Tuesday. Last month, the two officers who were stationed outside African National Congress (ANC) ward 52 councillor Boxer Zulu’s home in Phoenix north of Durban were ambushed and killed and their service pistols taken. Both officers, Zephania Dladla and Nomasonto Mhlanga, died on the scene. The four accused are expected to make a formal bail application.
