Growing the economy and creating jobs would be among the top issues under discussion at the Cabinet Lekgotla starting at the Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria later on Wednesday morning. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Cabinet are meeting to revisit government policies and programmes and plan the year ahead. The three day Cabinet Lekgotla is meant to breathe life into the governing party’s election manifesto, including an action plan to create 250 000 jobs in 2019 as promised by President Cyril Ramaphosa in January this year. The meeting brings together all the Ministers and their deputies as well as Premiers and top government officials to assess the implementation of government’s programmes. Decisions taken at this gathering will form the basis for President Ramaphosa’s much-anticipated State of the Nation Address (Sona) planned for next Thursday. Click below for cabinet related video:
