Residents of Alexandra are marching to the City of Johannesburg’s offices in Sandton north of Johannesburg. They gathered at the Alexandra stadium before embarking on the march.   Police have been deployed to the township after residents started blockading roads again on Wednesday morning.   They are aggrieved by Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba’s promises of rebuilding the eighty illegal properties demolished by the Red Ants in Malboro Gardens last month. In April, residents went on the rampage in protest over the mushrooming of illegal dwellings in the township.  Alex Shutdown committee member Thandiwe Mthombeni says, “We are frustrated to say we not going to allow him to build here while people have been having C-forms. Alex people didn’t get opportunities of having houses because people come and build in places where they are not supposed to and they get houses and these people are not even from Alex. So we are saying enough is enough.”
