The rush to get out of the Cape Town CBD is under way with just over an hours to go before the State of the Nation  Address (SONA). Traffic volumes have increased and many public transport commuters say with train services being so unreliable and many roads closed due to the SONA, it’s best to leave work early. Several roads in the CBD, especially near Parliament, have been closed. The number of police and traffic officers has also increased on roads leading to Parliamentary precinct. Some of those who work in the CBD are taking no chances and are leaving as early as possible. “We come out early because we go home early, because we must come out of this business. All the roads are closed and that’s why we are running to get out of this business. It’s the State of the Nation and that’s why we are on our way because the roads are busy traffic is busy,” says some workers.
