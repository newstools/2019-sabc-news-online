The Eastern Cape government is very concerned about the high number of illegal initiation schools operating during this winter initiation season. Three initiates have already died since the start of the season two weeks ago and up to now 69 initiates have been rescued from illegal initiation schools. Since 2012, more than four hundred boys have died undergoing initiation. In 2018, 19 Eastern Cape boys died during the winter initiation season. MEC of Co-Operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Xolile Nqata says they are happy to have rescued the 69 boys. “It is a relief that we have rescued those boys, because something could have taken place including loss of life. I must add by expressing our concern about illegal initiation schools that are dominant in the area of Mbizana and Ndabankulu in Alfred Nzo. We are going to act very strongly working with our partners against these illegal activities. One traditional surgeon has been arrested with two traditional nurses. 14 of those boys have been released to the care of their parents,” says Nqata. Watch video below for more on the story:
