Metal workers union, NUMSA, will brief the media later on Tuesday about a protest at the Lanxess Chrome mines in Rustenburg in the North West. About 200 NUMSA members have been staging a sit-in underground at the mine since last week Wednesday. They are protesting against the alleged sexual harassment and victimisation of a female employee. It is alleged that a senior male employee demanded sexual favours from the female worker in exchange for a permanent job in August last year. SABC News has still not been able to get comment from the mines’ management. NUMSA’s Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says: “The alleged perpetrator has never been suspended and no disciplinary action has been taken against him.  As a result of this reluctance to act against the perpetrator our members have been embarked on a sit-in over this issue.” Click on the video below:
