The Freedom Front Plus has called on government to take action against Zindzi Mandela after she allegedly posted a series of tweets against white people. The FF Plus has called the tweets divisive and called on Mandela to apologise. Party Leader, Pieter Groenewald says they will take the matter up in Parliament and with International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it is checking whether the tweets were indeed sent by Mandela as the Twitter account was not verified. But,  Groenewald says the Denmark Ambassador should be stripped of her position. “If she is not properly trained for her position, then she must be removed. She is not competent to be an ambassador. If she does not want to apologise then she must be removed as an ambassador and she can never be appointed as an ambassador again.”
