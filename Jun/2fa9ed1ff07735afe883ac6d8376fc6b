South Africans are being encouraged to donate blood; this follows a serious shortage of blood stocks in the country. On Saturday the South African National Blood Services took its blood drive to a biker’s rally in Mbombela. A rally with a cause, bikers from all over South Africa, Mozambique and eSwatini converged in Mbombela. Funds collected from the rally will be donated to needy communities among others. In 2018 proceeds were donated to the victims of Cyclone Idai. The bikers have teamed up with the South African National Blood Services, to mark World Blood Donor Month. SANBS’ Lebo Matsimbi says: “We really would like to encourage more people to become blood donors so that we can be able to save more lives.” Less than 1% of South Africans are active blood donors and a unit of blood only lasts 42 days after donation. Every unit can save a minimum of three lives. President of Sunriders MCC Trompies Matsane says:”Bikers are human beings as well, they must also learn to donate blood as you know that blood is needed for our people.” Donors can give blood as often as every eight weeks.
