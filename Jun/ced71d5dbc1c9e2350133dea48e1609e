Western Cape Minister of Community Safety, Albert Fritz, has condemned the shooting of six members of the Anti-Gang Unit at Samora Machel in Nyanga (on the Cape Flats). They were shot and injured as they were tracing suspects in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Fritz has called on anyone with information to come forward. “We really want to ask people or anyone with information and community members please provide the police with that information… I am also happy to confirm the meeting that I will be having with Minister Bheki Cele next week after the full address because at this point we just need to work together,” says Fritz. Police are monitoring the informal settlement.
