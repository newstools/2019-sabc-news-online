Arms manufacturer, RheinMetall Denel Munitions’ (RDM) is building a new R10 million day-care centre in Macassar, near Somerset West. CEO Norbert Schulze, says the centre will provide a safe learning environment for the community’s children. He was speaking at the sod turning ceremony at the site where the facility will be built, which is located opposite RDM’s Macassar headquarters. Schulze says the company started working on plans to build the day-care centre in 2016. Once completed, the centre will accommodate 150 children, from infants to Grade R learners. The facility will have two nursery areas, six classrooms, a playground and it will cover 1000 square metres. It will also have a kitchen and a sick bay. RDM says the school will also create 24 permanent jobs once it is fully operational. The company’s Macassar plant was the scene of an explosion in September 2018 which killed eight people.
