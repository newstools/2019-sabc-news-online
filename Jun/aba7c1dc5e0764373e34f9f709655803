KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has urged young people to avoid teenage pregnancy and substance abuse and start their own businesses. Zikalala was speaking at the 43rd anniversary of the 1976 Soweto Uprising at Impumelelo Stadium in Dundee, northern KwaZulu-Natal. The event was one of many Youth Day celebrations across the country. Zikalala says the youth should meet government’s development efforts halfway by changing their own behaviour. “Our message to the youth of South Africa is clear and simple. The future of the country belongs to them, and it is upon them to make our future bright and successful. We have to work together to address the high level of unemployment, and to do that we must address the challenges of skills, and the education system. We encourage all young people to take up education seriously and to ensure that they prioritize skills that are relevant to the economy of our country,” says Zikalala.
