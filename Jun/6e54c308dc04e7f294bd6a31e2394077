The African National Congress (ANC) insists that the investigation into whether any members supported the launch of other parties before the elections is not directed at its Secretary General Ace Magashule. The party has established a task team to probe allegations that party members were involved in the formation of the African Transformation Movement (ATM). The court case against Magashule relating to these allegations has since been withdrawn. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says the decision to set up a task team was prompted by a post-elections report.
