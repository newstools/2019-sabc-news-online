Police are still searching for three suspects after an attempted assassination of the SABC’s Chief Audit Executive, Thami Zikode, on Friday night. One man who has been arrested remains in police custody while three others managed to flee following a shoot-out with Zikode outside his home. The SABC says Zikode was a target because of the corruption cases that he has been working on. Police spokesperson Mawela Masondo says the matter is receiving high level attention. “The docket has been assigned to senior detectives from the station and provincial level who are working hard to get to the bottom of the matter and to trace the suspects that are still at large.” Masondo adds: “But there is information that we received from the suspect that is still in hospital under police guard.” Related video click below:
