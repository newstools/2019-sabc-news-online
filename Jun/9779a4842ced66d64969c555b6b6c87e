African National Congress (ANC) veteran and an ex-Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) soldier Malgid Ntlebi was buried in East London on Saturday. Ntlebi 83, died last week after a long illness. His comrades hailed him for his immense contribution towards the liberation struggle. Ntlebi was honoured with a special official provincial funeral. Bidding farewell to a committed democracy activist, Ntlebi was instrumental in forming ANC underground structures in the Border region. He also served 12 years on Robben Island for his political activities Buffalo City Mayor Xola Pakati says:”He was one of the veterans who mentored us young people and mobilized  us to take action against the apartheid state that was  terrorizing our  communities here and as such we heeded the call from the ranks of the youth, right up to the trade union movement and he has  always  been there as a pillar of strength and support.” Acting Premier Mlungisi Mvoko says:”We are deeply hurt, we lost an icon. We have lost a revolutionary and this is a wound that can only be healed by time.” The family lost a loving father and husband. Daughter Natasha Lombe-Ntlebi says:”The only thing I know from tata (daddy) is the love  he gave us. Tata loved us all.” Ntlebi is survived by his wife and two children. Click video below:
