The Zulu Royal household has clarified the reason behind the meeting between AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and the KwaZulu-Natal Executive Council lead by the province’s Premier, Sihle Zikalala, at Osuthu Royal Palace in Nongoma in the north of the provincel. The meeting took place on Thursday morning. Prince Thulani Zulu says the meeting is important because King Zwelithini works closely with all government departments in ensuring development takes place in rural areas. “This tells us about the relationship that exists between the entire Kingdom and the Cabinet. We know that the King used to open the legislature and that makes us proud and as the Kingdom, as you know unlike other provinces, our King does contribute to the development and service delivery of all the departments. Each and every department has something to do with the King, whether it’s social or agriculture or health. We know presently the King has spearheaded the circumcision, which has become very successful as a tool to fight HIV/AIDS and pre-marital pregnancies,” says Prince Zulu. Watch a related video below:
