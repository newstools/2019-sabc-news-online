Alliance partners in the Free State have called on the African National Congress (ANC) to act decisively against corruption in the province. The partners say the scourge of corruption has impacted negatively on governance and ethical leadership. The ANC in the Free State has convened a two-day Lekgotla, which got underway on Monday in Bloemfontein. Free State South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) Chairperson, Lucky Phooko has expressed concern about the state of municipalities in the province. “It’s all about service delivery. We have seen prior elections. There were a number of violent service delivery protest. At the centre was service delivery. So, as Sanco, we are making a point that service delivery must be taken care of because we are not going to listen to rhetoric. What we want to listen to is speeches on where and how as per municipalities who are under Section 139, those municipalities must get out of Section 139 and sustain themselves,” says Phooko.
