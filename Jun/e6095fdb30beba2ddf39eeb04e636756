Police say two suspects have been arrested following a gun attack on six anti-gang unit members in Nyanga on the Cape Flats. The officers were shot at while conducting a tracing operation in the Samora Machel informal settlement. Two unit members were seriously wounded and the other four also hospitalised. Police spokesperson, Novella Potelwa, says a second alleged attacker was nabbed in Cape Town after another suspect was arrested shortly after the incident. Police are searching for one more suspect.
