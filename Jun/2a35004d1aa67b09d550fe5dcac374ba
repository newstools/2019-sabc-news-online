The family of the three children, allegedly hanged by their father, has called on parents to learn from their loss and seek help when they cannot cope with life’s challenges. Grief stricken family and friends buried the three children in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria, on Sunday. It is a bitter start to Child Protection Week as three innocent lives, 2-year-old Lebohang, 3-year-old Amogelang and 11-year-old Thabang paid the ultimate price for their parents’ troubled relationship. Thabang was remembered as a bright, loving child who was protective of his siblings. Grandmother Evelyn Segone says the family is suffering. She says Thabang loved cricket and was very intelligent. Thabang’s schoolmates also paid tribute to him. It is alleged the 29-year-old father, hanged the three children, before hanging himself. He was the biological father of the youngest. The mother calls it an act of vengeance, sparked by her ending the relationship last week. She claims he had a drug addiction and was abusive. Family representative Angeline Ngwenya says there needs to be stronger awareness for parents in townships to access help or the national suicide line to prevent such tragedies. To ensure that these deaths are not in vain, the family has appealed on other parents to draw wisdom from their tragedy and seek help, instead of forcing their innocent children to pay the ultimate price. As we mark Child Protection Week, there is a call for parents to be caring and protective of their offspring. The three lives are now at their final resting place at the Winterveldt cemetery. Their father was laid to rest in Hammanskraal. For their mother, perhaps this could mark the beginning of healing.
