Residents living in and around Phalaborwa in Limpopo have been warned to be cautious at all times as 14 lions are on the loose and have been sighted roaming around the Phalaborwa Foskor Mine. It is suspected that the lions escaped from the Kruger National Park. The Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (LEDET) says it has allocated field rangers to closely monitor the movement of the lion pride before any action is taken. The LEDET, together with the Kruger National Park and Greater Balule concluded that the lions need to be captured and released back to the Kruger National Park.
