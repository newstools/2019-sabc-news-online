DA MP Phumzile Van Damme is expected to lay charges on Wednesday regarding an alleged racist incident that happened earlier this week at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. Van Damme accuses the Waterfrontâ€™s security management of allowing the people who are alleged to have hurled racist abuse at her to leave the facility. She says she has requested CCTV footage from the CEO of the Waterfront, but he says this can only be made available to the police. Van Damme says she now hopes police will be able to request the Waterfront footage and track down the culprits. The V &A Waterfront has tweeted an apology to Van Damme.
