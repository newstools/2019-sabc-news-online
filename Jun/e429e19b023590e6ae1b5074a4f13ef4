The Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town will celebrate World Oceans Day on Saturday morning with a Trash Bash at Hout Bay beach. Aside from the obvious perks of doing a beach cleanup, Trash Bash also contributes to important scientific research. The aquarium’s Renée Leeuwner says the  Dirty Dozen method is used to collect data. “It actually looks at 12 culprits that you would find on the beaches and these are anything from your plastics bags, cool drink bottles, bottle tops, plastic packets, cigarette butts, we are obviously collecting all the litter that we find on the beaches but we specifically monitor and record those 12 things that we have in our Dirty Dozen list.”  Click on video below:
