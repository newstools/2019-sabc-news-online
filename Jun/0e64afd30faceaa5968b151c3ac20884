The Congress of the People (COPE) has condemned the recent attacks on the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s office. The party’s Secretary-General Papi Kganare says a certain party wants to use the Public Protector’s office to fight its own political fights. He says his party will make sure that the office of the Public Protector is protected. Kganare was speaking at the party’s executive committee meeting in Bloemfontein where the party’s future was discussed. “We are really concerned about how the office of the Public Protector is being abused by dragging it into internal factional fights of a certain political party. Because, this is going to damage the image of the Public Protector’s office if we allow (it) and keep quiet and allow it to be misused the way it is being misused now.” Meanwhile, Kganare says COPE wants people who are implicated in State Capture to be arrested. “We are happy with the exposure of corruption and theft, which took place in the past through the Zondo Commission. But what we are worried about is, if these things happened, where was the police service; where was intelligence service to get these people arrested whilst they were still stealing out the money. The fact that they are exposed is good but it is not good enough. What is good enough is that we want to challenge the Minister of Police and the Minister of Intelligence to say their department must do their job, to make sure that all these people, whose names have featured at the Zondo Commission are arrested, prosecuted and sent to jail.”
