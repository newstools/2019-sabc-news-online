Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises (SMMEs) and previously disadvantaged individuals in Mpumalanga have been urged to adhere to relevant business procedures. This was revealed during the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) conference in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. The conference is aimed at educating, creating awareness and showcasing services that are rendered by various government entities to SMMEs. Executive Manager: Compliance Division at B-BBEE Commission, Busisiwe Ngwenya says sharing information is important for SMMEs to make a meaningful contribution to the economy of the country. “Another thing that we find is that you come here and talk about BBEE, but people also want to know where they can access funding. What other services does the government offer when you are starting your own business? So we also brought those services to say for instance if you want to go to companies and intellectual property commission to register your business what are the requirements. When you are talking about issues of tax compliance, you have got SARS, what are the compliance processes you need to adhere to and then who can now actually fund you and what are the requirements. So what we are saying is that government should not also put such high requirements that a person who is starting today cannot even access, let’s say R10 000 to boost their business or get funding into their businesses.”
