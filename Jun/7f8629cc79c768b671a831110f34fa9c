The Free State Department of Co-operative Governance says municipalities will now have to account for their poor performances. The department has called on all municipalities in the province to present plans to deal with Auditor General’s (AG) findings. The AG says not a single municipality in the Free State received a clean audit. Head of the Department Mokete Duma says the new MEC has come up with a 10-point plan to improve governance at municipalities. “We need to review all the employment contracts and performance contracts of the municipal managers and managers reporting directly to him. Because those contracts must then include a clause that deals with consequence management and among the things that he has also said that they need to demonstrate. What is it that they are going to do to ensure that they deal with all the previous findings, in terms of various financial years … so that we can correct the situation and a failure of which there will be adverse consequence management for those municipalities and senior managers who are not actually ensuring that they can undo it, correct the situation in the municipalities.” Watch related video on AG’s report:
