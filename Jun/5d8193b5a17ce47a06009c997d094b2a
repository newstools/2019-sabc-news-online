Koroneka Trading and Projects Director Babadi Tlatsana has told the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture that her company was hijacked by SA Express general manager Brian van Wyk to loot money from the North West government. Tlatsana has implicated Van Wyk in corruption and fraud pertaining to millions that were taken illegally from the North West government. The money was later siphoned off in a well-planned and coordinated looting scheme. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has heard how millions entered Tlatsana’s business account only a few months after she had proposed a plan to revitalise two airports at the North West province. She was told some of the money was to buy airport security cameras and fire engines, which never materialised. Tlatsana told Justice Zondo she was afraid to report to crime intelligence authorities because she was told by Van Wyk that he knew many people in the African National Congress. She says she was afraid for her life and started recording conversation’s she had with Van Wyk. Watch for more:
