The 19-year-old Forest High School learner from Turffontein in the south of Johannesburg has been granted R5 000 bail. The Grade 11 learner faces one murder charge and two of attempted murder for allegedly stabbing three fellow learners, killing one of them on Monday last week. The matter has been postponed to July 10, 2019 for further investigations. Magistrate Basimane Molwana delivered the formal bail judgment in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court a short while ago. In his judgement, Molwana said: “Despite the accused being a student at school, the court grants the accused bail at R5000. The second order is for the accused to be relocated to the jurisdiction which is known to the court as submitted by the state, the investing officer and the defence. So this is for the safety of the applicant before court.”
