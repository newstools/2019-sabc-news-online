The African National Congress (ANC) has pledged support for its Youth League ahead for its much-awaited elective conference. The two parties met at Luthuli House. On Tuesday, the ‘Revive ANC Youth League’ Movement took to the streets to call for the disbandment of the young lions. ANC National Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says that the party is committed to supporting the Youth League. However, the former treasurer general of the ANC Youth League says the party wants a radical youth league. “The Youth League that we want is one that will be able to attract the best amongst the youth.” Revive ANCYL member, Mboniseni Dladla, says the lack of leadership in the Youth League is to blame for the poor youth voter turnout at the polls. “There’s a vacuum; if you look at the voter turnout, young people did not vote because there is no one who is mobilising them with a political agenda.” Political Analyst, Thokozani Chilenga-Butoa, says the latest developments are a result of a leadership crisis.
