The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) says it will investigate the two major crashes that claimed a total of 36 lives. 24 people died in a head-on collision on the R81 outside Giyani in Limpopo, while another accident claimed six lives in the same area on Sunday. Six other people died in Mpumalanga on Friday. President Cyril Ramaphosa has been the latest to extend his condolences to the families. RTMC Spokesperson, Simon Zwane says all these incidents involved head-on collisions. “All of these accidents involved head-on collisions, which again calls for motorists to be more careful when driving on the road, to avoid driving at excessive speeds and be on the lookout for other road users. There has also been a number of pedestrians that have been killed in other incidents and we urge motorists as the holidays come to an end, (to) ensure that we avoid these unnecessary and avoidable incidents,” explains Zwane.
