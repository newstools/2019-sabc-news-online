Gender equality and women’s empowerment have dominated discussions on Saturday morning on the final day of the G20 Summit, in Osaka, Japan. Executive Director of United Nations Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, says women still continue to bear the brunt of unpaid care work that prevents them from participating in the paid economy. Mlambo-Ngcuka says the unavailability of affordable childcare is a barrier to progress and financially rewarding economic participation. “The burden of care is carried by women in most countries and in most economies.  In fact, this remains one of the biggest barriers for women’s economic participation across the world.  This is now why the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and economic institutions have regarded this as one of the most significant macro-economic issues that needs attention.”
