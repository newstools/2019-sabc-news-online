The sexual assault case of a 55-year-old Pretoria school teacher has been postponed in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. The alleged offences surfaced in January when members of the Tshwane Metro Police Department visited the school, to teach learners about abuse. Pupils then confided in the officers, alleging the suspect was inappropriately touching them. The teacher faces seven counts of sexual assault, common assault and crimen injuria. His alleged victims are aged between 10 and 14-years-old. Police and the Gauteng Education Department says about 23 learners from the school had laid complaints against the teacher. The case has been remanded to September 16. This is to allow state prosecutors to further consult with some of the pupils, who could become potential witnesses. The accused is out on R8000 bail.
