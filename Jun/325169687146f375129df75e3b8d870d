Barney Mokgatle, whose foundation is the recipient of the R200 000 that former Bosasa chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi was fined, says he believes Agrizzi’s apology was genuine. This comes after a settlement agreement with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) following Agrizzi’s racist slur admission at the Zondo Commission in 2018. Mokgatle who is also one of the former leaders of the 1976 Soweto student protest says he has accepted Agrizzi’s apology. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/711209">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
