There’s been a public outcry after the discovery of a dead 12-metre long Bryde’s whale in False Bay near Cape Town. The whale got entangled in nylon ropes used by an Octopus fishing company operating under an exploratory permit. Thousands of people have signed a petition to put pressure on the Fisheries Department to revoke the company’s permit. Over eight whales have died under similar circumstances in the area in the last two years. Marine Biologist, Dr Jannes Landschoss says the whole  scene was dramatic. “Seeing the whale trapped on this rope the whole dramatic scene was very touching on a very deep level, seeing it dragged onto land it was heart breaking to see. It was probably skimming through the water,” says Landschoss.
