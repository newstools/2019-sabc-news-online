Former National Director of Public Prosecutions, Mxolisi Nxasana is expected to give evidence at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry, in Parktown Johannesburg on Wednesday. He is expected to shed some light on how the NPA was allegedly captured. During his tenure, he had a fair share of disagreements with former President Jacob Zuma which led him to vacate office in 2015. Last year, the Constitutional Court ordered Nxasana to pay back R10-million of the R17.3-million ‘golden handshake’ Zuma gave him to resign as the NDPP. Click related video below:
