 African National Congress (ANC) chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal, Sihle Zikalala has called for a thorough investigation of the murder of the former mayor of Ndwedwe, north of Durban. Maxwell Hadebe was gunned down at his business premises in the Msunduzi area of Ndwedwe on Thursday night. Zikalala, together with provincial party leaders visited Hadebe’s family to extend their condolences. Hadebe served as mayor between 2011 and 2016. Zikalala describes Hadebe as a hard-worker who served the party well. “He’s one of those people who were on the ground as foot soldiers of the ANC and helped to coordinate and mobilise people behind the ANC while this area was under the opposition up until the ANC took over. The manner in which he was killed is very painful, brutal and it shows high level of criminality. We believe that whilst in the province there is this challenge of killing of leadership. We don’t want to conclude this is political killing or not.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
