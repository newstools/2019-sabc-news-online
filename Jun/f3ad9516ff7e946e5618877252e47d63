The High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday and Wednesday hear an application by civil society organisations, Corruption Watch and Right2know, to review and set aside the findings of the Seriti Commission. The Commission was established in 2011 to investigate allegations of fraud, corruption, impropriety or irregularity in the Strategic Defence Procurement Packages. In 2016, the commissionâ€™s report was released by former President Jacob Zuma. It found that there was no proof of fraud and bribery in the multi-billion rand arms deal. The organisations argue that the Seriti commission failed to conduct what they call the most routine of investigations, arriving at the implausible conclusion that there was no evidence of corruption in the arms deal. They also argue that the commission failed to comply with its mandate by misleading the public, ignoring evidence of corruption, failing to access information from abroad, failing to investigate serious allegations of corruption and failing to investigate new information that was put before it. The Presidency, in April this year, said it would not oppose the application, and would be willing to make submissions in court.
