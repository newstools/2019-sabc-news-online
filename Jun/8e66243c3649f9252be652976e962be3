The constant struggle for employment and employability is being addressed through a camp by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). At least 400 pupils from Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal have been granted an opportunity to participate in SA Air Force training. They also get introduced to various career opportunities within the military. Young falcons are ripping the rewards from an intense two weeks at South African Airforce youth development camp and waking up at the break of dawn to drills and enduring rigorous training. A brief demonstration of what they have learnt left spectators in awe. In the end, the youth were happy about the hard work they had put in. The 400 young high flyers got first-hand experience of the Air Force. Pupils, who excel in mathematics and science, get enrolled in the programme from Grade 10 and are then monitored until matric. The programme seeks to instill core values in aspirant Airforce pilots. The camp is expected to make its next stop in KwaNongoma during the summer holidays.
