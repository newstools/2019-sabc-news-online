Protesting residents of the Zwezwe informal settlement on the outskirts of Du Noon, near Milnerton, in Cape Town have torched a truck. They have called on the owner of the private land that they are occupying to intervene after the anti-land invasion officials resumed the demolition of illegally erected shacks. One of the protesters, Bongi Gocini says they have nowhere to go. “It is devastating and it’s frustrating for us, because we used our last money to build and the other thing, we don’t have another place to go. We work here close by; our kids are going to school close by.”  Last week, more than 200 shacks were demolished. The illegal structures went up more than a year ago on the privately owned land. Most of them are backyard dwellers from nearby Du Noon. Mayoral Committee Member for Human Settlements, Malusi Booi says it’s an ongoing operation to remove the illegal occupiers. “Now the private owner has requested us to assist in clearing that side. Hence it is a joined operation with SAPS. There’s a Sherriff on site as well and our law enforcement agencies are there as well.”
