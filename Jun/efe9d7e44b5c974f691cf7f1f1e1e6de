Former editor of the ANN 7 TV news Channel, Rajesh Sundaram, continues to testify at the State Capture Commission in Parktown on Tuesday. Sundaram has so far spoken about the level of influence the Gupta brothers had over former President Jacob Zuma. On Monday, he told the commission that the Guptas wanted then President Jacob Zuma to make sure his ministers attend televised “New Age” Breakfasts amid national outrage at the Waterkloof saga. The Gupta’s wedding guests were allowed to land at the national key point in 2013.
