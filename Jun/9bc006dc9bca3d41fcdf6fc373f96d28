The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has been requested former President Jacob Zuma to appear before it from July the 15th to the 19th. This comes after Zuma was mentioned in statements and testimony from various witnesses. According to a statement from the Commission, its lawyers have been in talks with Zuma’s lawyers since April the 30th. Meanwhile, former South African Airways Chief Financial Officer Phumeza Nhantsi has concluded her testimony before the commission. She told Judge Rayond Zondo in her concluding remarks that she strongly believed that she was the right person for the job despite the political interference and pressure she endured from the board. Nhantsi says she was naïve to believe that the board acted in the best interest of the company.
