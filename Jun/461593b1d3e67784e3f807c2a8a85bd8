Eastern Cape police are on the heels of a traditional doctor and a traditional nurse who allegedly illegally circumcised four underage boys in Scenery Park in East London. The Buffalo City Circumcision Forum has received seven reports of underage boys circumcised illegally in the Buffalo City Municipality. The father of one of the boys circumcised in the initiation school opened a case with the police after he learnt that his 14-year-old son had been circumcised without his consent. The father says he is saddened by this because his child was still yet to write exams and now he has had to go to the school to explain what has happened. Authorities are looking to shut down these illegal set ups before the winter initiation season gets underway. Traditional leaders agree. They want law enforcement agencies to bring the perpetrators to book. Buffalo City Circumcision Forum Chaiperson Stanley Makinana says the traditional surgeon took the boyâ€™s cellphones as a form of payment and they want to send a strong message to people to stop doing this. Communities and parents are urged to report such incidents to the police and traditional leaders. More than 20 young boys lost their lives during the winter initiation season last year. This year traditional leaders say they are working tirelessly to make sure no deaths are recorded or at least the numbers decrease.
