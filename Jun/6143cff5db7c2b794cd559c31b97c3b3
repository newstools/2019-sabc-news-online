The African National Congress (ANC) has warned members who take their views on internal issues within the party to social media platforms that it will cause division within its ranks. Party Secretary-General Ace Magashule says they will continue engaging these members, but has urged them to respect the leadership. This follows a tweet by Ekurhuleni Metro Mayor Mzwandile Masina after the inclusion of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan in the recently announced cabinet. The ANC is holding a three day lekgotla in Irene, Pretoria. Magashule says improper behaviour on social media needs to stop. “The issue of Masina and many others, we are saying comrades this must stop, making a lot of noise in the public, respect leaders. So we’ll engage those comrades who are tweeting, we will engage everyone and say comrades it stops here. Moving forward into the future, we are saying we will not allow you to do all these things. Please stay loyal, we are one leadership.”
