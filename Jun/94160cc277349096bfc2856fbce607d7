The Alexandra Total Shutdown movement is planning to have a public meeting on Thursday to discuss the demolition of illegal structures in the township north of Johannesburg. The City of Johannesburg took responsibility for last Friday’s demolition of illegally built structures. The Shutdown movement says it is happy that the City had acknowledged what it had done. “We were so surprised when the mayor said he doesn’t know anything. It was an issue of political pressure in the issue of eviction but we are happy that they admitted to the demolition and that those structures were unfinished and they were 80, that’s what is true. That’s what transpired on the ground,” says Sandile Mavundla, Convener. Watch a related video below:
