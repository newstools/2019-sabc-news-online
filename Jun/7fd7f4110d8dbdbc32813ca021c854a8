SA Express Airport co-ordinator Estelle Loock will continue to testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Tuesday morning. The commission will also hear evidence from SAA Fuel Management Head, Mark Vaughan. Alleged corruption and fraud at SAA and SA Express have been at the centre of the commission’s hearings for the past two weeks. On Monday, the commission heard how companies operating as cash delivery entities facilitated money laundering. Owner of Asset Movement Financial Services (AMFS) Kalandra Viljoen admitted that one of her major clients George Markides used the entity to move more R20 million in unlawfully obtained funds. AMFS took cash deposits from clients and convert it to cash for delivery.  Evidence leader, Advocate Kate Hofmeyr, told Justice Zondo that such companies should be investigated as they operate in the banking space without complying with the necessary banking act requirements.
