A Major in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has appeared before the Court of Military Justice at the Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, for refusing to take off her religious head scarf. The SANDF says Major Fatimha Isaacs is charged with wilful defiance and disobeying a lawful command. The matter has been postponed to the 7th of August. Meanwhile, Secretary-General of the Muslim Judicial Council, Shaykh Isgaak Taliep, says the SANDF is acting against Isaacsâ€™ constitutional rights. He says the MJC is supporting her in her fight to be able to wear an acceptable head scarf while on duty.
