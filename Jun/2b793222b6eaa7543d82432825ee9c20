 A teacher, who is alleged to have inappropriately touched learners at Valhalla Primary School in Centurion, will be back in the Pretoria Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday morning. He is facing seven counts of sexual assault. Police and the Gauteng Education Department say about 23 learners from the school had laid complaints against the teacher. The offences surfaced in January when members of the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) visited the school to teach learners about abuse. Pupils confided in the officers, alleging that the suspect was inappropriately touching them. The officer informed the principal who alerted the district office. The incidents date back to 2017 and 2018. The man was granted R8 000 bail in his February appearance. His case was postponed to allow social workers time to assess the competency of the various school children to bear witness in the case.
