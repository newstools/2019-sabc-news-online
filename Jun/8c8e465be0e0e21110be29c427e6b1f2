Political analyst, Xolani Dube says it will be difficult for the African National Congress (ANC) to fill the position of eThekwini Municipality Mayor Zandile Gumede. The ruling party’s Provincial Executive Committee resolved on Sunday that the mayor must take a 30 day leave of absence until the investigation into charges of corruption and fraud against her is finalised. Gumede is out on bail of R50 000 after she appeared in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court in May on charges related to a R208 million waste removal tender. Dube says it will be difficult for an acting mayor to work with councillors who are said to have benefited from corrupt activities within the municipality. “I think the ANC is in a serious crisis. Whoever that they are going to appoint as an acting mayor, she or he is not going to enjoy the full support of the council because the council currently, about 60 of them, they are implicated (in) that they were receiving favours through tenders,” says Dube.
