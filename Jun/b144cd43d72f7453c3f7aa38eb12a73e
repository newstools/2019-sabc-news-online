The three men accused of killing former ANC Youth League Secretary General, Sindiso Magaqa, are expected back in the uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court in southern KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday. The three were denied bail last month. Magistrate Fezile Msengana had ruled that they failed to convince the court that they were not a flight risk. The uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s court is expected to make a decision whether the murder trial of the three men will be transferred to a High Court or a Regional court. Sibonelo Myeza, Mbulelo Mpofana and Mlungisi Ncalane also face two counts of attempted murder of two councillors who were also injured on the day Magaqa was attacked in 2017. The former ANCYL leader was taken to hospital, but succumbed to his injuries after almost two months in hospital. During their bail application they had told the court that they are innocent. The three accused at some point of the case appeared in court along with then Harry Gwala District Mayor Mlululeki Ndobe and uMzimkhulu municipal manager Zweliphansi Skhosana whose charges were provisionally withdrawn due insufficient evidence.
