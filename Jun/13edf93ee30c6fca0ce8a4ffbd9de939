South Africa’s candidate to serve on the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Pansy Tlakula, has been elected to a four-year term. The Information Regulator Chair is among the nine new members chosen to serve on the 18-person Geneva-based Committee. It requires members of high moral standing and acknowledged impartiality. Members are elected by the 181 States who are party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The committee is responsible for monitoring implementation of the convention. “The first thing that I have to say is to thank my government for supporting my nomination. I also have to thank the officials here, Lyle Davidos and Motumisi Tawana. They did a great job… the mission and the Ambassador Jerry Matjila, not even forgetting Dr Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, they all lobbied very hard for me.” “This is important for South Africa as you know the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was inspired by us as a country, taking into consideration our history. So I am very thrilled that we are back on the Committee.” “I am very excited to be on the committee. I am also very humbled, I must say, that I have made it and I hope that even if I am there in my personal capacity, but I will be flying the flag of the country.”
