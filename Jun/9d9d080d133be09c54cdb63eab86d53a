Emergency authorities in the Mangaung Metro in Bloemfontein say they are fully prepared for any eventuality this weekend as a powerful cold front sweeps over the province. Emergency personnel, especially the fire department, have had their hands full in recent weeks due to unforeseen eventualities, worsened by plummeting temperatures. Mangaung Metro spokesperson, Qondile Khedama, has warned residents to exercise maximum caution, especially those who rely on paraffin and gas for energy. “We have our own people who have started rolling out in the last month. Fire management plan where they are putting offices, ready to ensure we are proactive in the situation of fire.”
