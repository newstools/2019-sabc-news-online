The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it has sent a letter to Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to seek a meeting in which it will share its concerns regarding the state of municipalities. The commission says it’s deeply concerned that municipalities are not improving in their audit outcomes. On Wednesday,  Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu released the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) 2017-18 report on the local government audit outcomes. The report reveals a regression in the audit outcomes. The commission says it continues to share the Auditor-General’s frustration that despite previous reports containing recommendations, the majority of municipalities have been slow in implementing Makwetu’s recommendations. The Auditor-General’s report is startling as it paints an overall picture which highlights that the performance of municipalities is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Watch a related video below:
