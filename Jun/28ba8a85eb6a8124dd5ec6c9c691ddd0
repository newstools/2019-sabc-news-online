Judgment in the bail application of a 19-year-old Forest High School learner in Turffontein south of Johannesburg is expected to be handed down on Monday in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. The Grade 11 learner faces one murder charge and two of attempted murder for allegedly stabbing three fellow learners, one of whom died. He fled the scene and police later arrested him in Dobsonville, Soweto. The learner’s attorney has called on the court to grant him bail, saying it will not be in the interest of justice to keep him in custody as he needs to write his examinations.
