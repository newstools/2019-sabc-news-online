Fuel retailers have expressed frustration over the Department of Energy delaying the release of the new fuel price adjustments. The price changes at midnight Tuesday. However, the department made the announcement hours before the price can be effected. The price was supposed to have been released last Friday to give retailers and consumers enough time to prepare. According to the statement,  both grades of petrol will increase by 9 cents a litre while diesel will go up by 33 cents. The Department of Energy has attributed the latest increase to the new carbon tax. “Retailers need to spend time adjusting their systems in line with the price adjustment. Not receiving it on time is a major inconvenience. Even worse we have our Muslim retailers who are fasting and need to go break fast. We just received the schedules now, other retailers will have to stay until late at night trying to ensure that the system is in place,” says Fuel Retailers Association’s Reggie Sibiya
