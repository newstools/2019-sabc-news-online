Police have declined to confirm that they are investigating a serial killer, but forensic criminologist Dr Pixie du Toit says he believes the killings are the work of a serial killer, who is possibly not another homeless person. “I am not of the opinion that the homeless people that’s now being killed are being killed by another homeless person. I think it’s like a serial killer that has moved into the area because they go and look for targets. It’s planned, it’s not random. He most probably walks around there during the day when the homeless people might be out on the street looking for a job or some food, but he knows they will come back in the night to sleep,” says du Toit. Police believe they are moving in the right direction in investigating the killings of five middle-aged homeless men in Pretoria in the past month. A source close to the investigation says a high-level task team is working around the clock to apprehend the suspect.
