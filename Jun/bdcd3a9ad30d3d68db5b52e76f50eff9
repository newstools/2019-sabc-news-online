The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will hold its Youth Day celebrations at the University of Fort Hare in Alice in the Eastern Cape. Party leader, Julius Malema, will deliver the keynote address. Provincial chairperson, Yazini Tetyana, says Malema’s speech will focus on issues affecting the youth. “He is going to touch more on the challenges our people are facing, particularly young people… challenges of unemployment, challenges in education, and the system, and try to link it with the issues of today… he is expected to address our people at 10:00 in Alice campus,” says Tetyana.
