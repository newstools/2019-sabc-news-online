The Economic Freedom Fighters Secretary-General, Godrich Gardee says no policy should supersede issues that are being discussed in Parliament. This as the country awaits the International Relations Department’s decision on whether South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela’s recent alleged tweets about the land issue contravene the department’s social media policy. Gardee says land is a public issue. “Where a policy is found to be repugnant and in contravention and in conflict with what Parliament has decreed on that policy, it is invalid and unlawful to that extent. It will be very much unlawful for Dirco and any other institution to call on the victimisation of sisi Zindzi Mandela.”
