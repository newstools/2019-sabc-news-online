Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says undercover police have been deployed to Forest High School, in the south of Johannesburg, to monitor incidents of gang violence. He was speaking on Tuesday at the memorial service of Daniel Bakwela, who was stabbed to death last week at Forest High school allegedly by a fellow learner. Lesufi has called on learners not to seek revenge for his murder. He says there are numerous cases of school bullies that the department is aware of and has requested that learners with criminal records declare them to their respective schools. The MEC says the department is currently looking for 500 bullies in schools in Gauteng. “We will unleash expert professionals to assist them before they can kill our children,” says Lesufi.
