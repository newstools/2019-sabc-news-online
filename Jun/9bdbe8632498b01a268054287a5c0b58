The Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) says it is planning to  haul Gauteng Mayor Herman Mashaba before the Ethics Committee of Council after the City of Johannesburg took responsibility for the demolition of illegal structures in Alexandra north of Johannesburg. City Manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni admitted in the Alexandra Enquiry sitting in Braamfontein that the city authorised the demolitions. This after Mayor Herman Mashaba made an undertaking to rebuild the houses at the City’s expense. The ANC says it was not surprised by the admission. “The Mayor is irresponsible, he is acting outside of the bylaws so we will have to take the decision to process him through various councils which he has for a long time defied to go to the Ethics Committee of Council so we will be taking the matter with the Minister of Cooperative Governance to ensure that the Mayor is brought to book,” says Johannesburg ANC spokesperson Jolidee Matonga.
