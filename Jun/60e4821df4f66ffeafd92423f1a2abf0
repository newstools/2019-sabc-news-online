A BEE commissioner together with National Treasury had warnedÂ the South African Airways (SAA) board, under the chairmanship of Dudu Myeni, not to implement a policy in which 30% of all procurement at the airline would be set aside for black businesses. In a letter that both the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) wrote to Myeni, they warned that the policy was against the BEE code of good conduct and the DTI said implementing such a policy would place them under scrutiny. SAA had been mandated to immediately report back to both the Treasury and DTI regarding the cancellation of this policy. Former acting chief procurement officer at SAA, Masimba Dahwa, told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that when Myeni tried to impose the policy he challenged her and the board. Myeni then allegedly threatened to remove Dahwa.
