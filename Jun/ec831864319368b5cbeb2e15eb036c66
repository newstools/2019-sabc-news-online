The Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani has reshuffled his mayoral committee. He has appointed Patriotic Alliance Councillor Marlon Daniels to head the Economic Development Directorate, and the African National Congress’s Noluthando Pink has been moved to Safety and Security. ANC councillor Litho Suka, who was a member of the mayoral committee for safety, will now be an ordinary councillor. This comes after Daniels lashed out during the council meeting, challenging people who allegedly sent him threatening messages, saying he must vote in favour of the proposed budget, or his family will be harmed. During his outburst Daniels mentioned that he was also enticed with a position in the mayoral committee leading to the budget vote. He’s told the SABC earlier, that he would not accept any position. “I’ve been offered a position to pass a budget, and I mean if I have been offered a position, and if I do that, and it’s a very selfish reason why I’m accepting that position. And that position makes myself a sole beneficiary of being in that position. You see, in politics, when you are in a position you should be able to have an effect on the disposition of the electorate out there; to improve their lives. That’s what the position should mean to you. So, no am not taking any positions and I’m not supporting the budget today; not at all.”
