Chairperson of the General Council of the Bar, Advocate Craig Watt-Pringle, says the Constitutional Court ruling in favour of advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi who were fired from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), is unfortunate. The Constitutional Court handed down judgment on Thursday after a long battle with the General Council of the Bar, which wants them struck off the roll. Jiba and Mrwebi will remain on the roll of advocates. Watt-Pringle says they respect the decision the Constitutional court. He says the loss was not expected. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/711210">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>   Meanwhile, the Presidency says Cyril Ramaphosa‘s decision to remove Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi from their posts at the NPA, still stands despite the Constitutional Court ruling. Jiba’s attorney Zola Majavu says they may take the Mokgoro report on review if Parliament backs Ramaphosa’s decision to axe his client and Mrwebi.
