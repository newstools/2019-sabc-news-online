High school students affiliated to lobby group Equal Education have handed over a performance contract to Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Pupils from five provinces protested outside the Department of Basic Education in Pretoria. Equal Education is challenging government to intensify its effort in the fight against violence at schools among other things. Head of communications at Equal Education, Leanne Jansen-Thomas, says Minister Motshekga has had two terms to deal with all the issues learners face and it’s time for her to make a real change in her third term. “The message we put to her was third term lucky. We handed over a performance contract to her, the people’s performance contract which stipulates deadlines by which minister Motshekga must meet those demands and they were around the theme of school safety, school infrastructure, primary school education and scholar transport and also transparency and accountability in how national and provincial education departments operate.” WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
