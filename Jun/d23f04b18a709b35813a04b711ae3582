Statistics South Africa says there has been an increase of 22 000 jobs in the formal non-agricultural sector. The results of the quarterly employment survey for the first quarter of 2019 were released earlier on Tuesday. It indicates total employment increased by 76 000 year-on-year between March 2018 and March 2019. This was largely due to increases in the following industries: community services, mining and quarrying, manufacturing and business services. There were decreases in the trade, transport and electricity industries and construction. “Remember, in December we have part-time people who are employed and come March quarter those people are laid-off. So, it’s tricky just to say employment has dropped without looking at the seasonality effect. Quarter-on-quarter employment increased by 22 000 and that number came from part-time employees,” says Stats SA’s Matlapane Masupye.
