 More than 300 members of South African Municipal Workers’ Union  (SAMWU) at Naledi municipality in Vryburg in the North West have shut down the municipal offices. They are demanding the removal of their mayor, Neo Schalk, the Chief Whip and the Speaker, accusing them of conniving with opposition parties in refusing to implement issues they have bargained with them. Such issues include among others, the permanent employment of temporary workers and back pay. SAMWU Provincial Chairperson, Tshepo Goralotse says the municipal offices will remain closed until their demands are met. “They have agreed to implement the demands of other unions, but when it comes to our demands they are deliberating collapsing the council. The ANC must recall them with immediate effect otherwise we will ensure we put pressure on the ANC to recall them.”
