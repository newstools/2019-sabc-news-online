The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) together with the SABC has made an application to seek an order reviewing and setting aside the decision to appoint Sekela Xabiso CA Incorporated as a service provider to the SABC. In a judgement handed down on May 24, the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg found that the appointment did meet the requirements of the SABC procurement prescripts. Head of Communications at the SIU, Nazreen Pandor, says the SIU and the SABC are studying the judgement.
