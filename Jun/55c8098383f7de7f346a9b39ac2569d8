The South African Airways (SAA) Board says they were surprised by Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Vuyani Jarana‘s decision to tender his resignation. They were briefing the media in Kempton Park, Johannesburg on Friday. The national carrier has announced its appointment of Zukiswa Ramasia as Acting CEO. Jarana cited uncertainty around funding and slow decision making processes that delayed the airline’s turnaround strategy as key reasons for his departure. The board says Ramasia’s previous position as SAA’s general manager for Operations will help in creating stability. SAA Board Member, Thandeka Mgoduso says Ramasia will begin her Acting CEO duties from Monday.
