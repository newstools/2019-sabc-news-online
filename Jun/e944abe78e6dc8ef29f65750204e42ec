The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  has refused to listen to Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and  walked out of the National Assembly. Party leader Julius Malema objected to Gordhan addressing the House in the debate of the State of the Nation Address. The party says Gordhan is a ‘constitutional delinquent’ after the findings of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane that Gordhan acted unlawfully in approving the early retirement of SARS Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay. Gordhan has since taken the report on review. The EFF says they will return to the House when Gordhan has finished his speech.
