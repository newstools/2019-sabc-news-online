Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, says she was poisoned following her investigation into the SA Revenue Service’s (SARS) so called ‘Rogue Unit’. She made the claim while addressing a gala dinner in Mpumalanga on Friday night. Mkwhebane says this is the second physical attack on her. She says after she investigated the ABSA bank case she had to report a case of malicious damage to property. Her spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, says they have had to review Mkhwebane’s personal security. “There was some security breach at her house and she did the necessary and approached the police and they attended to all of that. “I’m not sure if the police are investigating the criminality; all I am saying that steps were taken in terms of personal security to resolve that,” says Segalwe.
