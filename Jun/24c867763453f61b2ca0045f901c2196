Former president Jacob Zuma is yet to confirm whether he will be available on the days that the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has requested him to appear before it. The commission on Thursday asked Zuma to appear before it from July 15-19. This after Zuma was mentioned in statements and testimonies of various witnesses. The commission says its lawyers have been in talks with Zuma’s lawyers since April 30. Commission spokesperson Mbuyiselo Stemela says, “The Commission is currently reflecting on the fact that after six weeks since it requested that it be furnished with the required undertaking, it has not been furnished with the undertaking and we take such decision or decisions as it deems appropriate in due course and the public will be made aware as the Commission is continuing to inform the public as per rule 2.1 of the rules of the Commission.”
