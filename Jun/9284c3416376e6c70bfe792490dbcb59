The African National Congress (ANC)  in Parliament has confirmed that it will announce the new chairpersons of its portfolio committees in the National Assembly next week. Media reports claimed that the official announcement was delayed due to internal squabbles within the party. ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina has put the delay down to the recent resignations of some party members from parliament. “The reason for that is that we have experienced the resignation, and we when others are resigning-you are supposed to swear in new members. So that process has delayed us announcing the new chairpersons. But I must confirm to you that next week on the 19 June we will be announcing the new chairpersons.” The party in Parliament says it hasn’t received any additional names of members requesting resignation from parliament. Last week a number of former cabinet ministers tendered their resignations after they didn’t get cabinet posts in the Ramaphosa administration. The former ministers include Susan Shabangu and Thokozile Xasa. There were rumours that there might be another batch of former ministers who might be leaving. However, ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina has confirmed to the SABC that no other politicians have approached the party. Former Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant is the latest ANC MP to resign as a member of the  National Assembly. Oliphant is one of 14 former ministers from the fifth Administration who did not make it to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s sixth Administration.
