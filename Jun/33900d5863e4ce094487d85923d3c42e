The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has dismissed allegations by some eThekwini regional branches that the decision to place Mayor Zandile Gumede on special leave was not communicated with them. Scores of party members and supporters marched to the ANC’s offices in Durban on Wednesday. The group is  calling for the disbandment of the party’s regional executive committee to be set aside. Gumede is on special leave following her arrest for fraud in connection with a R208 million waste removal tender. Click on videos below:
