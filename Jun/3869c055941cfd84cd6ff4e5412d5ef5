Residents from informal settlements protesting against the demolition of their homes in Alexandra and Marlboro, north of Johannesburg have threatened to march to the Gautrain Marlboro Station, and prevent Gautrain from operating. This they say will continue until they get answers as to who is responsible for the demolition of their homes by the Red Ants. About 80 illegal structures, which had been built a few meters from the Malboro Gautrain Station, were destroyed by the eviction squad.  Thereâ€™s a heavy police presence in Marlboro near Alexandra. Residents are busy trying to salvage the remains of what used to be their homes. A big police Nyala and police vans are roaming the streets. Huge rocks and remains of burning tyres can be seen on the road heading to the Marlboro Gautrain Station. The situation remains calm.
