The Free State Education Department is pulling out all the stops to reclaim top spot in matric results. Part of the programme includes a six-day study camp which got underway on Sunday in Bloemfontein. More than 800 pupils are rolling up their sleeves as they will undergo intense learning programmes to hone their academic skills. The camp, dubbed Dinaledi and Dinaletsana, is to help produce more distinctions in the so-called tough subjects. Problematic study areas include Accounting, Mathematics and Physical Science. Learners hope the camp will give them a lot of time to study. Educators are completely on board. Teacher Lehlogonolo Tau says the camp also helps learners boost their chances of getting into universities. “The camp is also helpful for learners to know more and actually qualify so that when they go to university, they are admitted in those streams where there is a need in SA.” The camp comprises pupils from Grades 10 to matriculants. Tsatsi Montsho from the Free State Department of Education says that they want to promote STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics.) “We want to promote STEM subjects, but we are saying as a province, you can never do the STEM without reading and understanding.” Education officials are confident this intervention will help pupils ace their year-end exams.
