The South African Weather Service has warned of heavy rains expected in the Western Cape on Friday, which could lead to flooding. “Periods of heavy downpours may occur, which could lead to localised flooding. Informal settlements on the Cape Flats and the Overberg District are likely to be amongst the areas most vulnerable to flooding. Snowfalls are also likely over the southern mountains of the Western Cape on Friday night to Saturday morning,” according to a statement from the South African Weather Service. The cold front happens to coincide with the winter solstice, the longest night and shortest day of the year, and expected to bring extremely strong winds and is will affect the Western and Northern Cape. Light snowfall is expected on mountaintops in and around Sutherland. SABC weather forecaster Azwi Tuwani says, “The city of Cape Town for today, up to 80% of showers, heavy rains leading to localised flooding. Worcester at 27, Beaufort West at 26, super strong winds in the interior – up to 100km\h wind speed. It is clear currently, but we are expecting that development that would give us 100% chance of showers. Tomorrow, 60 with 16 degrees, 17 going to Sunday and the rainfall will dissipate going into Sunday.”
