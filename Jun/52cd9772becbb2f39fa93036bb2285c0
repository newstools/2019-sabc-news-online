The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the court judgment in the Karima Brown matter and says it will comply with the ruling. The two squared off after Brown received a barrage of insults and death threats from EFF members after party leader Julius Malema posted her cell phone number on Twitter after she had mistakenly posted an editorial brief in an EFF media WhatsApp group. The court found that the EFF had breached the Electoral Code of Conduct and ordered the party to pay costs. In its judgment, the court said that the EFF erred in not taking reasonable steps to ensure their supporters do not harass or abuse journalists or women. However it declined to impose the sanction of a formal apology and a R100 000 fine sought by Brown. This was due to the fact that the EFF had already apologised to her in the media and in answering papers to the court. It also did not impose the fine of R100 000 that Brown sought saying that the appropriateness of the sentence had to take into account the provocative stance adopted by Brown in her responses in social media to the EFF which fuelled the hostility between the two.
