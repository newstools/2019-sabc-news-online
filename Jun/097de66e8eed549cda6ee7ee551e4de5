National Freedom Party (NFP) leader Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi has resigned from Parliament. In the previous administration kaMagwaza-Msibi was the deputy Minister of Science and Technology from 2014 to 2019. She suffered a stroke 2014 and had been on the recovery journey since then. The NFP has also dealt with the blow of losing seats in Parliament from six seats to only securing two after the May 8 elections. NFP spokesperson Simo Mkhwanazi says kaMagwaza-Msibi will be focussing on rebuilding her party. “I can confirm that the President of the NFP Honourable Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi has sent her letter of resignation to Parliament that is with intentions to actually focussing on the party and considering that maybe it was in due time for her to actually consider the retirement. There are many reasons which one can consider, but amongst many it was actually to take rest considering the health of the president but amongst that other reasons she felt that it time for her to actually retire after having been the deputy minister,” says Mkhwanazi.
