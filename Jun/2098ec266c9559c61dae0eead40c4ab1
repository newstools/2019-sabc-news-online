The Lenasia Magistrate’s Court has withdrawn all charges against Fita Khupe – who was allegedly involved in the mass murder of a family in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, last year. In January, one of the two suspects involved in the killings is believed to have killed himself. Police say they found that 27-year-old Ernest Mabaso had hung himself with shoe laces in his cell. Seven counts of murder were brought against Mabaso and Khupe. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe says the decision to withdraw the charges was made by the prosecution. “I’ve been informed by the senior prosecutor that a decision has been made by the director of public prosecutions that all charges must be withdrawn. All charges are then withdrawn against both accused number 1 in absentia and 2 who is before court. , unfortunately, cannot offer any explanation, it’s not a decision made by the court, but it is a decision made by the prosecution.” WATCH BELOW:
