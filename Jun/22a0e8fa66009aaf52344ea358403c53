Eight Learners from Carnavon High School, in the Northern Cape, have been awarded a gold cup for “Inspiration” at the International  Lego League competition, which took place in Montevideo, Uruguay. The robotics team was welcomed by the provincial education MEC at the Kimberley airport. “So we won first place. I’m definitely going to take it forward. I am a learner that has Mathematics, Physics and Life Science, when I was participating in the robotic competition, I was also learning  about my subjects so at school it doesn’t have to be a struggle,” says one learner. “It was the first time I was competing in an international competition. This influenced me by thinking bigger, by going overseas and teach other people how we do stuff in South Africa and how engineering works this side. I would like to become an engineer, technical engineer,”  added another learner. With the combination of fun and learning, the SKA programme is dedicated to changing the lives of young people in the province, who are interested in pursuing careers in Mathematics and Science. “It’s all about STEM, so it’s about Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. If they are doing robotics, it’s like when you play. When you play, you play and you learn something. So the robotics it makes them to think, because they need to build things, they need to calculate distances, spot a lot of different factors that are combined in doing robotics,” says SKA representative, Chantal Mabeleng. MEC of Education in the province, McCollen Jack sees  programmes as essential in developing the province and the young people in the province. The national and international Lego League Competition was funded by the Square Kilometre Array programme and there are hopes that the programme continues to inspire young people all around the country to be interested in Mathematics and Science.
