African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has released the terms of reference for the independent team which will probe whether party members were involved in the setting up of smaller parties ahead of the 2019 elections. The decision to establish the team was taken by the ANC’s National Working Committee on Monday after allegations that Magashule was involved in the formation of the African Transformation Movement (ATM). The independent team comprising former President Kgalema Motlanthe, Frene Ginwala and Fezeka Magano will have sixty days to complete its report which may be extended if necessary. Although Magashule is at the centre of the damning allegations of mobilising support for the ATM, his office will act as the secretariat to the independent team. Having heard the testimony of witnesses and completed its work,  the independent team will then be required to handover its report to the ANC Secretary General’s office. Other terms of reference include that proceedings will be held in camera, no legal representatives shall be used and that the independent team can recommend disciplinary action to be taken against members found to have contravened the ANC’s constitution.
