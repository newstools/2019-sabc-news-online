A group of branch members of the ANC Youth League in Limpopo have demanded the disbandment of the league’s Provincial Executive Committee. The group assembled outside the ANC’s headquarters in Polokwane, where they submitted a memorandum of grievances. Spokesperson for the group Thabo Mabotja says the PEC is comprised of people over the age of 35. “The ANC Youth League is led by old people; it is no longer leadership, it is ‘elder-ship’. So we are elders that give this to young people. Young people want leadership full time, leadership to lead to them in a advancing struggles of young people. Therefore, old people we have nothing against you, but we are simply saying to you that the time to hand over the baton is now.”  The spokesperson of the ANC in Limpopo, Donald Selamolela, says that they have confidence in the leadership of the ANC. “We have confidence that the ANC leadership together with the national leadership of the African National Congress will reign supreme in terms of the matter that have been raised by young people and provide direction to all the young people of the country.”
