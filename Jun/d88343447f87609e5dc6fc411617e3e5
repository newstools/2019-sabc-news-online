The North West High Court has heard graphic details of how former provincial Deputy Police Commissioner, General William Mpembe, and three other senior officers allegedly concealed the death of one of the 34 mineworkers killed in the  Marikana shooting in August 2012. The four, who were in charge of operations on the day of the mass-shooting, are on trial for allegedly defeating the ends of justice and misrepresenting facts at the Marikana Commission. They allegedly arrested and loaded Modisaotsile Segalala into the back of a van and took him to police cells where he later died. The deceased’s son, Buti Segalala says they want justice in the matter . “We came here because we want justice for our father. He was killed, and we don’t really know how by who. Maybe we can get closure. He was the breadwinner at home.”
