The State Capture Commission – sitting in Parktown, Johannesburg, has heard how the SABC deviated from it standard price guide in a deal to provide 33 hours of archive footage to Infinity media – which later became ANN7. Testifying before the Commission,  former SABC senior archive sales representative Sias Scott related how he was assigned to work on the deal by former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. He says he engaged in discussions with Oakbay head Nazeem Howa and ultimately, with former News Chief Executive, Jimi Mathews’ consent, cut the price for the footage from R100 to R70 a minute and waived the R500 per hour cost for use of the SABC’s edit suite. Scott says the discounts were justified.
