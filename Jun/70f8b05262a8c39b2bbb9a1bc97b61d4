The new chairperson of Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), the Inkatha Freedom Party’s  Mkhuleko Hlengwa, says it’s time to take advantage of the amendments to the Auditor-General Act to implement consequence management. Hlengwa has taken over from Themba Godi whose party, the African People’s Convention, did not win a single seat in Parliament following the May eight elections. This is not the first time this position has gone to an opposition party member. Mkhuleko Hlengwa says, “Ours is to actually draw into issues of non-compliance, the issues of shortcomings and challenges. But, I think we need to be more pro-active as a committee and not wait until the end of the year with the submission of the annual report.” Watch the full interview
