South African Airways (SAA) has appointed SAA’s general manager for operations, Zukiswa Ramasia, as the carrier’s Acting CEO. This follows the recent resignation of SAA CEO, Vuyani Jarana. Jarana cited uncertainty around funding and slow decision making processes – delaying the airline’s turnaround strategy – as key reasons for his departure. Briefing the media in Kempton Park, Johannesburg, SAA Board Member Thandeka Mgoduso says Ramasia will begin her Acting CEO duties from Monday, the 10th of June. “Zuks currently holds the position of general manager for operation. What we are now focusing on is strengthening the executive to run and deal with the operation side in the company. The board and executive met with the unions this morning. We started by meeting with the executives so that we could inform them about the appointment of Zuks into the acting CEO position.” WATCH BELOW:
