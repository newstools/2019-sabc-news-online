The rand is slightly firmer against the greenback in early trade. The local currency scraped back some of the losses experienced the past week after United States President Donald Trump suspended his plans to place tariffs on Mexico indefinitely. This may possibly account for some risk sentiment in support of Emerging Marketsâ€™ as stocks in Asia extended gains across the board after the announcement. The rand is currently trading at R14.88 against the dollar.
