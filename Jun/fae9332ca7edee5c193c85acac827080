Child Protection Week was officially launched at the weekend by the Social Development Department. The campaign is aimed at raising awareness about the rights of children. The Department says 1 in 3 children experience abuse. Although South Africa is rated among the best in terms of legislation, research shows there’s poor implementation. Manager for Social Work Services at Childline Gauteng, Bulelwa Dabula says the plight of South African children is very bad, “Our children are faced with a whole lot of challenges. They are exposed to violence; they are exposed to rapes – rapes that are done by family members at home, rapes that are done by community members, rapes that take place at schools. They are exposed to HIV & Aids.” Sandy Mahapi who manages the organisation’s Helpline and has also managed its Sunlight Safe House says the optimum strategy study of 2016 states that 34% of children are going through physical abuse, and about 35% of them are going through sexual abuse and 42% of them are exposed to domestic violence.
