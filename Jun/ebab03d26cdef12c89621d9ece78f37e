Members of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in the Eastern Cape plan to march to a hotel in East London where the ANC provincial executive is to hold a provincial lekgotla on Monday. They want a task team overseeing the affairs of the League to be dissolved. The Youth League members say an elective conference was supposed to be called in September last year. Organiser of the march Pedro Mzeleni says, “The ANC must take a decision at the level of the NEC to disband the NEC of the Youth League and install a national task team of young people who are between the ages of 14 and 35 who will build structures and build the ANCYL to become this revolutionary force that we know of.” Watch the video below for related news:
