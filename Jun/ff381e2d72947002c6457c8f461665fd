Friday marks World Blood Donor Day. This is a global celebration of the millions of people throughout the world who donate blood on a voluntary, unpaid basis to save the lives of those in need. The day was established in 2004 by the World Health Organization to both raise awareness about the need for blood donation and to acknowledge and appreciate blood donors for their gifts. The day also aims to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and to encourage regular blood donation by suitable donors. Donating a unit of blood can save the lives of up to three patients in dire need of blood. Becoming a regular blood donor ensures makes it possible for the South African National Blood Service to collect sufficient safe blood to meet the demand.
