Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Regional Court on Friday in a case related to inciting trespassing. This follows calls he made at the party’s inaugural conference in 2014 for the invasion of vacant land. The case has been postponed on numerous occasions both in the Newcastle and Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Courts to allow the High Court in Pretoria to make a ruling on the constitutionality of the Riotous Assemblies Act in the new South Africa. Malema has maintained that the case is a ploy by political opponents to destruct his career. EFF Free State deputy chairperson Mahlomola Majake says, “87% of land and we were left with 13%. The reason why he is taken to court is to crucify him because he is trampling on the white monopoly capital. We will never allow that, we will support our CIC.”
