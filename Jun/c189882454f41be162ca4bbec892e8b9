The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants practical solutions when President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers his State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday. DA leader, Mmusi Maimane spoke to the media in Parliament about his party’s expectations for Sona. The DA wants bold action – SONA that prioritises job creation as well as outlines a clear plan to overhaul state-owned companies, while highlighting reforms to labour legislation. It has reiterated its stance against nationalisation of land. The DA also insists that municipalities should purchase electricity independently, hence the DA-run City of Cape Town’s decision to take national government to court to force this move. The party is also eyeing announcements around curbing corruption and reducing government expenditure. Maimane says, “I’m hoping that the president will, as I have announced that we’ve written to seek an ad hoc committee that will make sure that there is an oversight committee over the presidency, but it can process the impending public protector report, so that the president can come and answer questions about the donation to his son.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
