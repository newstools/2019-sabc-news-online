KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has warned against the burning of trucks and factories as well as violent labour protests saying these actions scare off investors which ultimately leads to job losses. Zikalala was addressing a two-day Provincial Cabinet Lekgotla in Durban. This was the first cabinet meeting of the new members of executive since they took office in May. Zikalala says such violence is absurd behaviour and casts the province in a negative light. “The recent incidents that have taken place in the province undermine economic growth. These incidents include burning of trucks, torching of business premises in areas such as Isithebe, stoppages and extortion by business forums, intra-party political violent, violent labour strikes, all of these are affecting stability. As a result, it undermines the potential of economic growth in the province,” says Zikalala.
