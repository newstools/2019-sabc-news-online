International Relations says it will enforce its social media policy and take further action should it conclude that Ambassador Zindzi Mandela was behind some of the tweets under the hashtag ‘Our Land’. The string of tweets, allegedly posted by the Denmark Ambassador, caused uproar on social media with some users labeling them as divisive and against the Mandela legacy. However, speaking out for the first time, Dirco says it cannot verify the authenticity of the tweets. Dirco Spokesperson Clayson Monyela says,  “That account that has been tweeting is not a verified account. It becomes difficult, if not impossible to know who it belongs to. Secondly, we would need to get hold of Ambassador Mandela to check whether this is her account; whether she is the one who has been tweeting. We will then bring in our social media policy and take the process forward.”
