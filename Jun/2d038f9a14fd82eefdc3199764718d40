The African National Congress’ reduced majority in the National Assembly is an example of the benefits of democracy. This is according to Freedom Font Plus Leader, Pieter Groenewald. The ANC only has 230 of the 400 seats in the Assembly which prevents it from forming a quorum on its own to take decisions in the House when all Ministers and Deputy Ministers are out on government business. The ANC will, therefore, need the co-operation of other parties to pass legislation and take other decisions. Groenewald told the SABC that the ANC’s majority is below 60%… “We always say that the less the majority of the government is, the better government they have to become, to ensure that they make the right decisions and that their people are disciplined and to ensure that they are present (in the House). For instance, – yes, the Freedom Front Plus will surely co-operate with the opposition parties. For instance, if there  is certain legislation or even motions and we see that the ANC has not had a quorum or a majority in the House, we will co-operate (with the opposition) to ensure that  we don’t accept certain legislation or certain motions.”
