 Former Justice Minister Jeff Radebe has denied allegations that he promised then acting NPA head Nomgcobo Jiba, the National Director of Public Prosecutions position. The allegations were made by former NPA head Mxolisi Nxasana during his testimony at the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture. Speaking to SABC News, Radebe says he did not have the power, as then Minister of Justice, to appoint the National Director of Public Prosecutions. He says Nxasana’s allegations are unfounded, “He says he got wind that I wanted to install Nomgcobo Jiba as the National Director of Public Prosecutions. So I’m not sure what he means that he got wind, from the east, from the west, from the north, from the south. The appointment of the NDPP is the prerogative of the president as the head of the national executive. So there is no truth or basis to what he is saying.” Watch Jeff Radebe’s full interview below:
