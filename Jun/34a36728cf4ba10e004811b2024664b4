At least 45  people have suffered minor injuries after two trains collided at Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, Saturday evening. The injured are being transported to nearby hospitals. Metrorail spokesperson Lilian Mofokeng says “At this state, we do have around 45 people that are confirmed to have suffered minor injuries and we are prioritising to ensure that we assist them. With emergency teams that are on sight to help us out.”  Transnet says a Temping Machine busy with maintenance collided with the new Metrorail train at Eerste Fabrieke Station. “The temping machine rolled from Greenview back to Eerste Fabrieke station where the Metrorail train was stationery and carrying commuters on-board,” Mofokeng explains. Metrorail says as a result of the collision, the train service between Pienaarspoort and Pretoria has been affected. It adds that the line has been closed to allow both Metrorail and Transnet technical teams to attend to the accident. In January four people died and more than 600 were injured when two commuter trains collided at the Mountain View Station in Pretoria.
