Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Donald Trump met on Friday morning on the side-lines of the Group of 20 leaders’ meeting. The two leaders were scheduled to have talks on trade and military issues. The meeting follows a media briefing on the outcomes of the bilateral meetings held on Thursday between Japan and China. Foreign Press Secretary Takeshi Osuga said the Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting confirmed to develop a free and fair trade system. He said the leaders also agreed to create a business environment that is equal, not discriminatory and predictable. “President Xi conceded that the world is watching this year’s G20 meeting under a complicated global situation, which gives the summit an important meaning.” Meanwhile, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is in Japan for the G20 Summit to tell the world  that South Africa is open for business. Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu says the President is accompanied by several ministers including Naledi Pandor of International Relations, Ibrahim Patel from the Trade and Industry portfolio as well as Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. World leaders kicked off one of their most high-stakes G20 meetings in years on Friday, with rows brewing over a bruising US-China trade war, geopolitical tensions, and climate change even if US President Donald Trump was offering a more conciliatory tone. https://t.co/14wC9QakUL pic.twitter.com/nljXN81Vk8 — SABC News Online (@SABCNewsOnline) June 28, 2019  President Ramaphosa in Japan for G20 Summit https://t.co/4FoTvcLNnr — SABC News Online (@SABCNewsOnline) June 27, 2019 Click on the videos below:
