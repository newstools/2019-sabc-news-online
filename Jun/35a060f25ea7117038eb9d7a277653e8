Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has called for the values of the Constitution to be upheld and for more rigorous testing of prospective leaders. He was addressing the Directors Event at the Sandton Convention Centre north of Johannesburg. The event brings together senior managers and executives. The aim of the gathering is to discuss youth unemployment, digital transformation and politics. Mogoeng believes South Africans must re-embrace values of respect, responsibility, accountability, self-reliance and hard work in order to be a great nation again. “When you go back to the values which entail integrity, responsibility, accountability which comes with honesty you can’t be corrupt can you? And you can’t cover up for a corrupt person, you can’t keep quiet in circumstances where an injustice is being perpetrated, particularly to the prejudice of the vulnerable.”
