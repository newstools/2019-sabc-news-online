Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane has granted an extension to President Cyril Ramaphosa to clarify the Bosasa payments to his African National Congress presidential campaign. This will allow him to submit further documents to the Public Protector. Mkhwebane is investigating a R500 000  donation by Bosasa. Ramaphosa received the money during his ANC presidential campaign in 2017. The Public Protector is also probing whether Ramaphosa deliberately misled parliament on the issue. “One of the reasons the president advanced was that he was held up in matters of state including preparing for yesterday’s state of the nation address and thus he was not going to have enough time to engage with his legal team to work on his submissions – on those grounds the Public Protector has granted him that extension,” says the spokesperson for the Public Protector, Oupa Segalwe.”
