The Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders has expressed concern over the many incidents of illegal circumcisions in the province. The province has recorded 19 incidents of illegal circumcision since the start of the winter initiation season. Thirteen of the boys were rescued in the Buffalo City region, six others at Lusikisiki. Their ages range between 13 and 15. House of Traditional Leaders’s Mzi Nkantsu says the boys have been taken to rescue centres. “We have dispatched medical health professionals to make sure that they assess the conditions of the boys. Where they are now they are safe, they are receiving attention. The traditional surgeon has escaped and police are pursuing him and soon he will be caught and it will strengthen our application for him to be denied bail whenever we find him.”
