The Inkatha Freedom Party‘s (IFP) KwaZulu-Natal elective conference in Ulundi, on the north of the province. has been delayed. The conference was supposed to start at midday on Saturday. However, there are still long queues of delegates still waiting to be accredited. The last provincial conference was held in 2011 and the party was supposed to hold another conference in 2014. However, the seating of the conference was shelved due to the mushrooming of bogus branches and factionalism in the organisation. The IFP Secretary-General Velenkosini Hlabisa says the process of establishing the authenticity of delegates has caused the delay. “The conference is an elective conference. When elections are involved, you need to be very careful in terms of ensuring that the delegates are the right people who must attend the conference. Because if you did not give that due consideration, you will experience a challenge of some people challenging the outcome of the conference. We were hoping that things would be faster, but they are not going faster, as we would have wanted them to. But it is the expected number that we are expecting.”
