Koroneka Trading and Projects Director Babadi Tlatsana has concluded her testimony at the State Capture commission in Johannesburg after making some startling claims about African National Congress (ANC) funding and corrupt ministers. She says she was instructed by then former SA Express GM, Brian Van Wyk, to release R20 million from her account, to allegedly bribe then ministers Lynne Brown and Dipuo Peters. In a tape recording played at the commission Van Wyk told Tlatsana that money laundered in her account from the North West provincial government through an SA Express deal was to be used to pay ministers, government officials and fund some ANC activities. Tlatsana is still seeking payment from the North West government in regards to her agreement. She also told the commission how unsafe she felt after finding out what arrangement SA Express had secretly entered into with the North West government. She detailed how she and her family were being followed around, including how documents pertaining to her case have disappeared at the police station. Tlatsana says she is still getting death threats and phone calls and feels very scared. Tlatsana says she reported the matter to the police but they have not done anything about it. The commission is expected to resume on Monday. Click video below:
