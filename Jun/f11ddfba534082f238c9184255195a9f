An innovative Black Rhino conservation project is on the go in the Eastern Cape. The Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency,  says a number of private game reserves and the local community are combining resources to ensure the survival of the animals. The black Rhino custodianship project is a breeding scheme where 20 rhinos will be put together on one piece of land. The baby rhinos will be used to establish new populations in the province. Poaching remains a massive threat to the survival of the Black Rhino and the location of the project is kept a secret. “The beauty of the triple arrangement where you have got the state, private land owners and the communities makes the protection of the system better because of everybody from a conversation point of view who has an interest,” says Eastern Cape parks and Tourism CEO, Vuyani Dayimani.
