The Stellenbosch Mediclinic is in the process of relocating to a new venue in the area. The hospital was previously situated in the suburb of Die Boord but due to the growing demand for care from an ever-expanding Winelands community, the move has become necessary. The newly-built hospital will initially offer 95 beds with the capacity to expand to 160. There are 3  theaters and 8 different units within the hospital. Mediclinic’s, Carol van Zyl, says longer term patients who are being treated in the old facility will be safely transferred from Saturday. Patients remaining at the Die Boord premises include those in the orthopaedics unit, which will remain at this site for the time being, as well as patients in the mother and child units.
