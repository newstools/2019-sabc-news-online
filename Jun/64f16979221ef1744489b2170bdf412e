Residents of Alexandra Township, north of Johannesburg, have vowed to intensify their protests. They marched to the regional offices of the City of Johannesburg in Sandton earlier on Tuesday, but officials failed to meet them to accept their memorandum yet again. The residents blockaded several entrances and exits to the township as part of the so-called total shutdown of the area. The action followed Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba’s promise to rebuild the illegal structures which were demolished in May. The disgruntled Alexandra residents, who marched to Sandton, are now making their way back to the township. This after representatives from the City of Johannesburg failed to meet them and listen to their grievances. A large police contingent is escorting the marchers along the way to ensure that traffic isn’t severely disrupted. Click video below for more on the story:
