The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro has put more than R100 million into its War on Waste program which will officially run for three years.  The work will be done by cooperatives who will employ people in the wards where they operate to clean up the city. This compliments the Good Green Deeds campaign launched earlier this year by President Cyril Ramaphosa, but it is not officially part of it. These cooperatives will start immediately executing the much anticipated project. They will be focusing on areas of New Brighton, Uitenhage, KwanoBuhle, Njoli and Veeplaas, which were identified as problem areas within the metro. Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Mongameli Bobani says that the local government is trying to bridge the gap between the poor and the rich through this programme. “These cooperatives, they have never benefited from the municipality. It is the first time that they are benefiting from the municipality. This will actually create a number of job opportunities. This project is a R43 million project per annum.  This is one of the biggest projects because it is the first time that disadvantaged people are benefiting from their own government , more than R100 million.” The 41 co-operatives are more than excited to take on this challenge. “This programme is going to be a great help or the community. It is also going to create employment. So wherever we stay, the programme is going to be a benefit to all of us.”
