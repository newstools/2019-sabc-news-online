The African National Congress’s (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee meeting in Mpangeni on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast has decided to disband the party’s eThekwini Regional Executive Committee. The region was supposed to hold its conference last year but postponed it due to the general elections. eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has also been asked to take leave of absence. Gumede, who is also the regional chairperson, is out on bail of R50 000 after allegedly defrauding the municipality about R208 million in a refuse removal tender. “Without saying comrades who are charged are guilty as the PEC, we want to affirm the decision we have taken, we have taken a view that anyone who is charged for any serious case will have to step down and the ANC subject that mater to processes within the movement. The ANC should finalise those processes within 30 days, and that stepping down means, a comrade charged must take a leave, but if a comrade is not taking a voluntarily leave the ANC will be compelled to remove that comrade and ensure that members of the ANC vote out that person,” says Sihle Zikalala who is the Provincial chairperson.
