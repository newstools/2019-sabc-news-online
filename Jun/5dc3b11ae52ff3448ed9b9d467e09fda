The African National Congress (ANC) says no one has the right to threaten another person. The party has opened a case of incitement of violence against Afrikaans artist, Steve Hofmeyr, at the Johannesburg Central Police Station. Hofmeyr threatened South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela and Democratic Alliance (DA) MP, Phumzile van Damme on Twitter. He said Mandela and Van Damme would die if they took the land that belonged to him and fellow South Africans. African National Congress (ANC) national spokesperson Pule Mabe spoke outside the police station on Monday. “We know that there could’ve been others that were unhappy by the statement that were made by our Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane, even with that no one has got a right to say that they are going to kill others. It doesn’t matter whether you are white or black they don’t have that right,” says Mabe. Watch a related video below:
