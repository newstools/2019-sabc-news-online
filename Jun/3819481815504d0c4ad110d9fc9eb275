Re-igniting the country’s economic growth, creating jobs and the reconfiguration of the state will top the agenda at a three-day Cabinet Lekgotla at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guest House. The new administration is mapping out plans for its five-year term. It will also inform President Cyril Ramaphosa’s  State of the Nation Address next week. The President is returning from an international labour conference and is coming back to pressing domestic issues.  He is chairing his most important meeting since being voted into power. President Ramaphosa, his deputy, David Mabuza, cabinet ministers, premiers and senior officials are locked in a Cabinet Lekgotla.  An economy which contracted by 3.2 % is high on the agenda. The Cabinet will also discuss economic solutions to the limping economy. The Lekgotla will also discuss the configuration of the state.  Some government departments were merged and certain functions shifted. President Ramaphosa is also expected to clarify the government’s position on the raging debate of the Reserve Bank‘s mandate. That is part of the African National Congress’ 2017 resolutions. The debate, after being placed in the public domain by ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, rattled markets last week. Click below for more on the story:
