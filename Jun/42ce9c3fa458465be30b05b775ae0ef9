Professor Andrew Robinson of the North West University says the introduction of Antiretroviral (ARV) HIV drugs is not the end of the epidemic. Speaking at the 9th SA AIDS Conference in Durban Robinson raised concerns that people around the world including policy-makers are complacent and too relaxed about the existence of the virus. Robinson says the epidemic has increased among young girls between the ages of 14 and 19. He also raised concerns over the increasing number of teenage pregnancy at South African schools. He says: “People think there is treatment and we don’t have to worry. This is why this conference is so important. It is for us to take stock of exactly where our short falls are.” “One of the short falls is the adolescent stage, that is where the epidemic is bubbling. I am really pleased that the department of Basic Education has realised that teenage pregnancy in our schools tells us two things, school kids are having sex and that school kids are having unprotected sex.” For the latest on the conference watch below:
