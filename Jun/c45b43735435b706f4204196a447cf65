Veteran journalist Karima Brown says her victory against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is a win for journalism and media freedom against what she calls the ” bullying tactics ” of the party. The Johannesburg High Court ruled in favour of Brown after she received insults and death threats from EFF members after party leader Julius Malema posted her cellphone number on twitter. Brown claimed that the party had contravened parts of the Electoral Act by intimidating her as a journalist and wanted it to be held responsible for its conduct on social media platforms. The court found that the EFF contravened the Electoral Code and must pay costs.
