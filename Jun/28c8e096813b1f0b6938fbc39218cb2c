Rand Water has scheduled a 54 hour water supply disruption in Johannesburg. This is due to maintenance repairs. The service interruption will take place Monday. Rand Water says sufficient measures are in place to ensure residents get water. Ahead of the planned disruption the city says reservoirs have the capacity to supply water for two days, it urged the public not to panic. Environment and Infrastructure Services Department Nico de Jager says, “From our side, all our reservoirs will be fully operational as well as our water towers, if we do that there is no reason that that we should  be running out of water. We might have a problem with pressure, that will be in high-lying areas but it’s not going to be like people won’t be without water.” Affected areas must anticipate low water pressure during the disruption. Businesses are likely to be affected by the service interruption but they are planning ahead. Hell’s Kitchen Jono Kirby says, “We need to cater with getting extra water with big drums of water and that is what we busy catering for today. It’s not ideal with toilets and obviously cleaning dishes and that kind of stuff but it is difficulty to use water sparingly. We just brought three massive drums for each day and we still going to fill up prior to Monday.” Some Johannesburg residents expressed frustation but say it needs to be done and maintenance needs to happen. The cons are that there are businesses and they need to utilize water. Residents of affected areas are urged to use water sparingly. Watch videos below for more on the story:
