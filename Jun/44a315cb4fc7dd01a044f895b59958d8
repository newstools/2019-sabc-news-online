Former Finance minister, Trevor Manuel, urged graduates at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein to be exemplary leaders. Manuel was addressing a number of master’s and doctoral graduates. He raised concerns over issues of ethical leadership in the country.  He encouraged graduates to turn their knowledge into tangible results. Some of the conferred masters and doctoral degrees were from the faculties of Law, Education and Humanities. Families of graduates came to witness their great moments. Justice Mahube Molemela, whose been appointed as the first female judge president in the Free State division of the High Court, was presented with an honorary award.  Malomela says the award should serve as inspiration. “I’d love to say to other woman out there, this serves as inspiration and here it is. It has happened to me and it can happen to anybody.” Manuel told graduates that the future of the country is in everyone’s hands. With the state of the country’s economy, he says the State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa is a step in the right direction. “The complaint is that it contained no solution, but the State of the Nation Address is not meant to bring all the solutions. They meant to convene us and give us a way forward. But miracle solutions are not available to solve our problems. What we need is hard work and staying on the right path and confronting that which is wrong.” Jerry Mofokeng wa Makhetha, who’s known to South Africa’s TV screens as Neo Mokhethi, was also honoured with the Degree of Doctor in literature.
