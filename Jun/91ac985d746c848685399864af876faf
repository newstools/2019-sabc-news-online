The Democratic Alliance (DA) has rejected the revised ministerial handbook, saying it fails to set limitations on lavish ministerial expenditure. It says the handbook in its current form is nothing more than a blank cheque for ministers to spend taxpayers’ money on their own private affairs. DA’s Dr Leon Schreiber says the revised handbook does not limit the amount a minister or deputy minister is allowed to spend on ministerial vehicles. “The DA will continue to fight and push for a reform of a ministerial book, which significantly reduces the expenditure on luxury life style for ANC cadres and ministers and ensures that the money is spent on the people of South Africa to build a more prosperous country for all.” Click audio below for more on the story: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/711776">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
