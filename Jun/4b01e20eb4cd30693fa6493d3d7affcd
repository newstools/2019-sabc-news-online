An Ennerdale father, who accidentally shot and killed his son, has been handed a suspended sentence of 10 years imprisonment for culpable homicide. Sibusiso Tshabalala shot his son Luyanda‚ outside the Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale‚ south of Johannesburg‚ in June last year. He entered into a plea bargain with the state, and has been convicted on a charge of culpable homicide following numerous delays in the case at the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court, south of Johannesburg. The court heard that he had dropped off Luyanda at the school for evening classes and then fell asleep in the car. In an affidavit‚ Tshabalala claimed that he had shot his son after mistaking him for a hijacker. Sibusiso Tshabalala filed representations for his plea agreement with the Director of Public Prosecutions in December, when he agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge, claiming that it was not his intention to kill or even shoot his son. Tshabalala has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, which is wholly suspended, on condition that he is not found guilty of any violent crime.
