The three-day African National Congress (ANC) Lekgotla starts on Saturday in Irene, Pretoria and will continue until Monday. More than 60 ministers are part of the Lekgotla, which follows the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Friday. The Lekgotla will focus on the party’s performance during the May 8 general elections. Secretary General Ace Magashule says it will give the newly-appointed ministers and deputies a mandate from the ANC on what is expected of them in this sixth administration. “Lekgotla (will be) giving a mandate to our ministers and deputy ministers, premiers and everybody to say this is the line of march; you have to address all these issues. Township revitalisation, unemployment and inequality and above all, unity and renewal. So, that as we move forward we know that we are solid,” says Magashule. Watch a related video below:
