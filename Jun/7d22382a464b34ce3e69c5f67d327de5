The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has warned of a risk of a revolution if the governing African National Congress (ANC) government does not expropriate land without compensation. Debate on the State of the Nation Address is underway in Parliament. EFF leader Julius Malema says President Cyril Ramaphosa’s SONA did not inspire any confidence, especially in relation to the land issue. Malema also says Ramaphosa appears to have reneged on the position his party held on land expropriation without compensation in 2018. “We, therefore, warn you, if you do not expropriate land without compensation and return it to its rightful owners, the democratic project remains in a permanent treat. Our people are going to engage in an unled revolution because they will be fighting in what rightfully belongs to them. We said here, in encouraging the ANC, that we cannot use the land issue to encourage people to vote for us. It is an emotive issue and when we speak about it we must be meaning it.”
