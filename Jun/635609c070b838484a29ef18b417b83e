The African National Congress (ANC) KwaZulu-Natal top leadership will on Monday meet with representatives of branches that marched to the party’s provincial offices last week. Branches supporting embattled eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede took to the streets last week demanding her re-instatement to her office and that the party set aside its decision to disband the party’s eThekwini Regional Executive Committee. They are also rejecting the Regional Task Team appointed to prepare for the regional conference. Gumede took special leave on request by the party after she was arrested and charged with fraud and corruption in relation to a R208 million waste removal tender. Meanwhile, the Mayor of Newcastle Ntuthuko Mahlaba is also on leave after he wrote to the party requesting time to deal with his legal issues. Mahlaba is facing a murder case after the killing of an ANC youth leader.
