Northern Cape’s new Premier is ruffling some feathers. Dr Zamani Saul first opted to have his inauguration in a township. Now he wants to eliminate state tenders and establish a state-owned construction company but there’s mixed reaction to that. Businesses fear this may lead to their demise. From stationery, to toilet paper to roads and hospitals government has virtually everything on tender. Saul wants to change this. He says it’s cumbersome, expensive and open to corruption. He also wants a State Owned Construction company to build houses, roads and other infrastructure. The Business Community is conflicted. Saul says the state-owned Construction company will train especially young people and absorb them but he’s nevertheless expected to consult widely. It’s envisaged the construction company will provide youth employment and upskill them.
