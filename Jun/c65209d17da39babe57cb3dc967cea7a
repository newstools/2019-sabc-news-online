Parliament says National Assembly Speaker  Thandi Modise is seeking advice on how to best deal with Democratic Alliance  Chief Whip John Steenhuisen’s request over Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane because the structures of Parliament have not been established yet. The Rules Committee will meet next week to establish the Parliamentary Portfolio Committees in line with the reconfiguration of the Ministries. Steenhuisen wrote to Modise a day after she was elected Speaker, calling on her to institute a new investigation process into the fitness of Mkhwebane to hold office. Steenhuisen said it followed the latest judgment of the North Gauteng High Court which set aside Mkhwebane’s report into the Vrede Dairy Project. “The Speaker has received the letter of request form the Chief Whip of the official opposition regarding the initiation of removal proceedings against the Public Protector Advocate Mkhwebane. So the rules indicate that, – as wand when the Speaker receives a request of this nature, she is obligated to refer it to the appropriate structure of the National Assembly for consideration. So, as you know quite a number of structures of Parliament have not been created yet. So the Speaker therefore is busy seeking advice on how best to deal with the request of the Democratic Alliance,” says Parliament’s Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo.
