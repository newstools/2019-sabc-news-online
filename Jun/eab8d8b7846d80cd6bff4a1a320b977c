The office of  Limpopo Premier, Stan Mathabatha, has voiced concern over the province not receiving a clean audit outcome at any of its municipalities. This after Auditor-General (AG), Kimi Makwetu, addressed the media on Wednesday on the local government audits for the 2017/18 financial year, saying not a single municipality in the Free State, Limpopo and the North West received a clean audit. He has attributed pervasive control and monitoring failures being behind only 18 out of 257 of South Africa’s municipalities obtaining clean audits. Makwetu says irregular expenditure among municipalities amounted to R25 billion. The AG says the collapse of VBS Mutual Bank will add to service delivery problems in Limpopo in the future. Eight of the province’s municipalities had investments with VBS Mutual Bank, in contravention of the Municipal Investment Regulations. “We are quite concerned as a province that most of our municipalities haven’t actually have progressed in the audit, because of the VBS collapse, it was a concern. This report is for 2017/18 and as we have had interaction with the AG a few weeks ago, they showed that because they have a dashboard report, it looks like in the coming audit we will have improved significantly,” says the Limpopo Premier’s Spokesperson Kenny Mathivha.
