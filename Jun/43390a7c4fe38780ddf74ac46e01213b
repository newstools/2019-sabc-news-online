The Vaal University of Technology (VUT) wage strike is over. The university says it has reached an agreement with the striking unions, effectively ending the week-long strike that had led to the suspension of classes. Demonstrating workers had blocked entrances to the university’s main campus in Vanderbijlpark. They were demanding a 10% salary increase, but have now accepted the university’s offer of a 7.5% hike. VUT Spokesperson, Mike Khubone says all parties have resolved to resume operations on Wednesday. “Yesterday (Tuesday) we met with all the unions and all the unions did agree to our offer which was revised. So all the unions accepted the offer of 7.5%. And what we agreed upon is as from today (Wednesday)  the normal business operations will kick-in. That means all workers are back at work then the exams are starting again on Friday.” Click on related video below:
