Minister of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services, Stella Ndabeni- Abrahams, has assured the nation and the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) that there is no blackout that’s going to befall the public broadcaster. Ndabeni-Abrahams’ comment follows recent media reports that suggest that the SABC might not be able to pay its employees come month-end. Speaking outside Parliament, before the sitting of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday, Ndabeni-Abrahams says processes are under way to ensure that the SABC gets the much-needed bailout. “Rest assured, as soon as the Treasury finalises their processes, the SABC will continue with what it is doing. You are not going to get any blackout, that we promise.” Watch video below for more:
