Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature Speaker, Helen Sauls- August, says the budget allocation for the State of the Province Address (SOPA) has been reduced from R5 million to R700 000. Sauls-August has been addressing the media on their preparations for the SOPA that is expected to be held on 28 June. The SOPA will now be held inside the legislature chambers and a marquee will not be hired. She says it will also not be necessary to hire ablution facilities, a catering company and mobile fridges. “The implications of this decision are that the number of the guests attending the official opening is reduced from 1200 to 650.  Although there will still be catering for guests it will be reduced from a three course meal into finger lunch for everyone. The printing of invitations which was previously outsourced will now be done internally.” Meanwhile,  Eastern Cape Deputy Speaker, Mlibo Qoboshiyane,  says they will ensure there are effective oversight programmes. “It is not going to be a question of annual report presentation but it is going to further touch, see and feel what has been done over the period of a year. Remember that we visit schools twice a year but we can’t go to school just to see the opening. I think doing more with less and the usage of public resources and this legislature is also mindful of the fact that we need to cut costs on things we can do without.”
