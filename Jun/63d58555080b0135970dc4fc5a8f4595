The City of Johannesburg will on Friday, outline interventions to lessen the impact of the impending water-shedding on its residents next week. Rand Water, the bulk water supplier for the city, announced a major water supply shutdown which is expected to last for 54 hours beginning Monday. Residents might experience water shortages or low water pressure. The shutdown is part of Rand Waterâ€™s infrastructure maintenance programme which will see the installation of a 2 500 millimetre Butterfly valve from Lethabo to the Vereeniging pumping station. The City of Ekurhuleni will also be affected and they anticipate low water pressure in some arrears of the East Rand for the duration of the maintenance and afterwards while the system recovers.
