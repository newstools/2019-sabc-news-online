Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu has defended the State of the Nation Address that President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered last week, saying it included important elements on how to grow the economy. Opposition parties had criticised the speech, calling it an empty dream. Mthembu says the remarks of the opposition parties expose their ignorance about the importance of a visionary government. “Those who say the SONA was about the dreams, they do not understand that all the major revolutionaries worldwide began with a dream. A people without a dream, with visions and purpose is a people without future. It was the dreamers who gathered in Mangaung in 1912 and formed an organisation that fought against the resilient against colonial, and apartheid oppression informed by the dream.” Watch for more on the story:
