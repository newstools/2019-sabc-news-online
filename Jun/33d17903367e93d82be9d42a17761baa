Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says his party has prospects to grow and improve its performance in the next elections. The veteran leader was addressing delegates at the party’s KwaZulu-Natal elective conference in Ulundi on the northern part of the province, on Saturday. During the recent general elections, the party reclaimed its position as an official opposition in KwaZulu-Natal and increased its members in the National Assembly. “As the IFP support grew in the 2019 elections so the ANC’s support declined. The ruling party shed 10% of their votes here in KZN. The IFP has a fair chance of overtaking the ANC in this province in the next general elections, but that depends on certain things; that we do not relax; we do not say we have arrived. We can now relax. We can only do that if we double up our numbers in the next five years,” says IFP leader. The conference is finally underway after being delayed for about six hours. Party Secretary-General Velenkosini Hlabisa says registration and verification of delegates caused the delay. The last provincial conference was held in 2011. Mbangiseni Yengwa and Nkandla Mayor Thamsanqa Ntuli are contesting the position of provincial chairperson. Click below for more on the story:
