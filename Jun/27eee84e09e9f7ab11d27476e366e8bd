The Alexandra Shutdown Committee says there will be a complete shutdown of the township on Wednesday. This follows Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba’s promise to rebuild illegal structures which were demolished in the township, north of Johannesburg. The mushrooming of illegal dwellings in Alexandra sparked what has become known as the Total Shutdown Movement. Alexandra residents had welcomed the demolition, saying they had long called for such action to be taken as an answer to their call to stop queue jumping for housing. Organiser of the Alex Shutdown Committee Sandile Mavundla says: “We will come and we will close all entrances of Alexandra. No one is going to come in and go out of Alex and we will gather at one of the stadiums in Alexandra and then in full numbers we will be approaching the capitalists city that is 2km away from Alex.” Watch related videos below for more on the story:
