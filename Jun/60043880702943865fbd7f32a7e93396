South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board chair, Bongumusa Makhathini says Chief Audit Executive, Thami Zikode is expected back at work on Monday after an assassination attempt on Friday evening. Zikode survived a shooting while in his car outside his home. Four suspects fired at his vehicle after apparently following him home from the public broadcaster’s Auckland Park offices. Police recovered a firearm at the scene and arrested one suspect. The other three are on the run. A get-away car was later found near Southgate shopping Mall. Zikode is part of a team looking at a number of reports relating to irregular expenditure and other matters at the SABC. Makhathini says he has met with Zikode, who will be back at work on Monday. “He’s in good health, he’s safe, he’s not deterred, and he’s not discouraged and prepared to continue driving this. For the first time SABC has got the right executive, the right people in the right roles to really drive this clean-up campaign.” “He’s fully committed. I mean I was actually shocked. I said “do you need some counselling, do you need any support?” he said “Chairperson I’m basically confident in what I’m doing and I’m prepared to do this because it is the right thing to do.” And we commend people like him who are really prepared to go an extra mile in doing what is right of South Africa and it’s the only way to move this country forward.” Click video below:
