Former President Thabo Mbeki says former State Security Agency head Arthur Fraser‘s claims of apartheid agents infiltrating State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) should be taken seriously and be investigated. Mbeki was speaking to the SABC. The former President says he finds it strange that crucial State institutions like Eskom and the South African Revenue Services were apparently driven to the brink of collapse. “The former DG of the State Security Agency Arthur Fraser says part of the problem we have is that the ANC and other structures like this and then the government structures after 1994 were infiltrated by agents of the apartheid regime who remain he says in senior positions to this day. The Nugent Commission on SARS, it makes the same statement. We must have a look at that what lies at the base of this crisis in order to be able to find a correct solution,” adds Mbeki.
