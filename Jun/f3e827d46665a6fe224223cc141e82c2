Political killings in the African National Congress’ eMalahleni region in Northern KwaZulu-Natal are being fueled by a battle over state resources, according to one political analyst. Xolani Dube believes the infighting is directly linked to the looting of Newcastle Municipality coffers. Dube says, “It’s about tenders, it is about patronage, it’s about money because some of these guys, you have to remember that some of them they do not have careers and so their careers are solely in politics.” Last week, Newcastle Mayor Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba appeared at the Madadeni Magistrate’s Court on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Political killings in KwaZulu-Natal have increased in recent years, leading to the establishment of a special task team to resolve more than 132 murder investigations.
