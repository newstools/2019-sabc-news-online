Eastern Cape police have arrested a 29-year-old traditional surgeon (ingcibi) who allegedly circumcised four under aged boys at Scenery Park in East London on Friday. The father of one the boys has opened a case with the police. The Buffalo City Circumcision Forum has already recorded seven illegal circumcisions of under aged boys since the start of the winter initiation season. Police spokesperson, Hazel Mqala, has urged parents to always know the whereabouts of their children during this season. “A 29 year-old male yesterday (on Tuesday) at Scenery Park in connection with unlawful circumcision, he will appear in the East London Magistrate’s Court soon. We as SAPS members, we are urging community members to look after their children especially this time of the year. The schools will be closed and the boys are going to circumcision, it may happen some, they don’t even tell their parents. They go to the bushes without the consent of the parents,” says Mqala.
