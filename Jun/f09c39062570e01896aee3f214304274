Warning: Graphic content Student organisation SASCO wants jail time for the 19 year-old suspect, accused of murdering 21 year-old Naledi Lethoba from Welkom. SASCO led hundreds of students and community members to the magistrate’s court. They also want the suspect to be denied bail. The gruesome murder sent shockwaves through the Welkom community and surrounding areas. Lethoba’s body was found in this open veld on 19 May, days after she disappeared. The Goldfields College student’s body had severe stab wounds and lacerations. 19 year-old Obed Leshoro, who is also a student, handed himself over to police, accompanied by his parents. It’s believed the two students were romantically involved. Student security is back in the spotlight. Female students say that they are now living in fear. The victim’s grandfather, Molefi Nyakane, says the family is relieved that the suspect is behind bars. “This is where my grandchild died, we are hurt by what happened but we also want police to do their work. If the suspect is linked to the murder we want him to face a harsher penalty.” The accused appeared briefly two weeks ago. He’s expected back in court on the 12th of July.
