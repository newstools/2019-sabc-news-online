The National Youth Development Agency has called for a single tertiary education system that will see more black youth gaining access at any tertiary institution in the country. NYDA chairperson, Sifiso Mtsweni says there should be one application form for all institutions. The NYDA officially launched Youth Month at the Hector Peterson Memorial Square in Soweto on Tuesday. Now, a call is made to the ANC led government to make sure of a single tertiary education system; thus assisting to save application costs that are required by the different high learning institutions.  Mtshweni says South Africa must have one tertiary application form. “There must be one application form in South Africa. We shouldn’t be told to apply left, right and centre. When you have matric and you want to study mechanical engineering, you must fill in one form; attached to that form, you fill in the NSFAS form and it must be processed centrally. When there is space in Free State, you must be sent to Free State; when there is space in Limpopo, you must be sent to Limpopo.” Gauteng MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture, Mbali Hlophe, says government is willing to come to the party. “There are various apps that young people can use. So when you to go and record your music and so forth because you can’t afford studio time, there must be apps that are created for you to be able to record yourself and to be able to put in an instrument and so forth.” More youth related activities are scheduled to take place throughout the country in June. The 2019 16 June commemorations will take place in Polokwane, Limpopo. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
