Allegations of maladministration, fraud and corruption have rocked the Go-George Bus Service in the Southern Cape. A group of shareholders have accused the company’s directors of illegally paying themselves huge monthly bonuses. Thousands of commuters rely on the bus service daily, to commute to work in the region. The bus service was launched in December 2014, and provides affordable transport to thousands of George residents. However, not everyone is happy about how the operating company, George Link, is doing business. A group of shareholders allege that company directors are paying themselves huge monthly bonuses. They want Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to intervene in the proposed roll-out of phase 4 of the project in areas such as Thembalethu. His predecessor, Blade Nzimande, visited the area a couple of months ago. “The last time Mr Blade was here, the last minister, he said that before the implementation of anything, all the sectors need to come to a round table so we can resolve the outstanding issues.  We are not saying the bus must not run, we need the buses, but it must be done in a very proper way,” says Xolisane Booi of the George Community Forum. The directors responded saying the additional money is actually safety and security allowances they receive from government. They say the majority of directors are satisfied about how the company is being run. “We are not hiding anything. We ask them to not spread rumours and rather come to us, and ask for proof, so that we can go through the whole process together,” says John Heathcote, George Link Director And Operations Manager. Western Cape Minister of Transport, Bonginkosi Madikizela, says he is also waiting for Minister Mbalula to meet with him, with the issues surrounding Go-George being top of the agenda.
