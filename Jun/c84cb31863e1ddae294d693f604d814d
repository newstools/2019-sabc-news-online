The 9th South Africa AIDS Conference will kick off on Tuesday at the Durban ICC with more than 3000 delegates from the health technology sector expected to attend. The four-day event will be officially opened by Health Minister  Zweli Mkhize. The gathering aims to bring together policy makers, scientists, medical doctors and governments to establish and combine efforts to end the HIV epidemic. In 2019, the conference will also introduce digital technologies that are instrumental in curbing HIV /AIDS. Conference chair, Professor Refilwe Phaswana-Mafuya, says the conference will give women, youth and transgender an opportunity to be at the forefront since they fall under the group with the highest infection rates. “Infections rates among key populations, men who have sex with men, female sex workers, transgender and women. The statistics in terms of HIV prevalence announced this group are unacceptably high.” “So if we want to see change in terms of bio behavioural structural intervention that we put in place we need to prioritize these groups.” Click video below:
