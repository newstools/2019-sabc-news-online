Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Speaker, Buyelwa Mafaya, has condemned alleged threats made against two councillors. It’s alleged that hitmen were sent to threaten Patriotic Alliance councillor Marlon Davies, and COPE’s Siyasanga Sijadu, into voting for the proposed metro budget. The council meeting sat for the third time earlier on Wednesday and the budget has not been passed. Mafaya has appealed to the affected councillors to report the matter to the police. “I have a responsibility to make sure all councillors (are) safe at all times. Now that I have received them, I have asked all councillors who have received a threat to open a case from SAPS and bring a case number and liaise with the safety and security department in the municipality and after investigation they will later be contacted.” Sijadu says she found four men at her house threatening to harm her family if she does not vote. She, however, says the threats do not terrify her. “It’s quiet unfortunate that our city had deteriorated to the point where now, when we have an opposing view, that your life and families will be put on platter for people to pick and choose whether they want you to be alive or not. It made me want to come here today so they threaten me and not my family.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
