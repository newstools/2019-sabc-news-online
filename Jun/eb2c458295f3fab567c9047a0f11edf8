University of the Western Cape academic, Professor Sean Davison, has been effectively sentenced to three years house arrest in the High Court in Cape Town. The founder of Dignity SA faced three counts of premeditated murder for allegedly administering lethal amounts of drugs that killed three men between 2013 and 2015 in Cape Town. The State alleged that the 58-year-old academic assisted in the suicide of his friend Anrich Burger, who had become paralysed after a car crash. It also accuses him of having a hand in the deaths of Justin Varian, who suffered from a motor neuron disease and triathlete Richard Holland, who had been paralysed after a cycling accident. Davison entered into a plea agreement with the state.
