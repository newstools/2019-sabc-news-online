The National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has vowed to continue with the strike at the Vaal University of Technology (VUT) until management meets their demands. The two parties met on Monday morning to discuss the way forward, and are expected to make an announcement later in the day. Workers are demanding a 10% salary increase while the university is offering 6.2%. VUT remains closed and exams have been postponed. Nehawu Spokesperson, Khaya Xaba says, “The strike this morning has entered its 4th day and will continue indefinitely until all our demands are me. And our demands are 10% salary increase and the in-sourcing of cleaning and security services. The management is currently at 6.2% while we are still at 10%. So, we are hoping that they will come to their senses and increase their offer and meet our demands of 10%.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
