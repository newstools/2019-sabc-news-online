The Automobile Association (AA) is predicting good news for motorists next month. In mid-month data released by the Central Energy Fund, the AA predicts a decrease of 91 cents per litre in the petrol price, 70 cents in the diesel price, and 62 cents in illuminating paraffin.   Retreating oil prices have attributed to the decreases as the tug-of-war continues between the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting CountriesÂ  (Opec) countries and the USA. There had been a remarkable drop in the price of oil since the end of May. However, a weakening rand, in the wake of the African National Congress (ANC) top leadership dispute over the future of the Reserve Bank, means the decrease could have been higher. The AA has urged government to reach consensus on its economic policy in order to increase confidence in investors.
