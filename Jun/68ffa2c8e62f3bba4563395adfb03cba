Chaos erupted during the KwaZulu-Natal State of the Province Address (SOPA) in Pietermaritzburg on Friday.  Members of the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) staged a walkout. They are accusing the African National Congress (ANC) for not consulting them about non-members being invited to the sitting. Former President Jacob Zuma and AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini were among the guests.  Objections were raised even before the business of the day began. The DA and the EFF accused the ANC of undermining the rules of the house by allowing those who are not members of the legislature to attend the event without consultation with the opposition. It resulted in members of the EFF and the DA to storm out of the legislature. KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango  says they cannot allow a situation where by they make the rules and on the other hand break them. The main opposition, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), condemned the incident, calling it shameful. After much delay proceedings continued. Premier Sihle Zikalala called for tough action against lawlessness. He promised a skills audit would be conducted on all civil servants. The premier further announced that the plight of residents of the recent floods, that claimed 71 lives, was being addressed. Opposition parties were critical of the speech. The IFP’s Velenkosi Hlabisa says that the speech was long and boring and did not provide any tangible plans of addressing the issues facing the people of KwaZulu-Natal. The premier committed to dealing with problems facing the province’s municipalities. He also promised that his government will ensure the full implementation of the Moerane Commission recommendations. The Commission probed political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. Watch below:
