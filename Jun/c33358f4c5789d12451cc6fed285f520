Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has hinted at the possibility of e-tolls being scrapped, saying various stakeholders will soon discuss the impact of the controversial saga. The ANC in Gauteng is pressuring the newly appointed Transport Minister to act against e-tolls, as motorists are refusing to pay for it. Opposition parties have also demanded that e-tolls, which were introduced in 2013 should be scrapped. Mbalula says it is not an easy issue to address, but the matter will be addressed and all the stakeholders will be involved. He says, “The solution could be that the e-tolls go but if they go, how are we going to address the issues that we are faced with in terms of the debt? The strategic goal is to ensure that South Africans are part of the solution in the long term.” “It is not an easy issue that we say scrap and that is it. The fact of the matter is that people are not paying and the debt is ever-growing.” Related video below
