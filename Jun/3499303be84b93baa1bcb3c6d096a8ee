Two alleged rhino poaching kingpins and their co-accused are expected to appear at the White River Magistrate’s court on Friday facing charges of dealing in rhino horns. Mpumalanga Hawks Spokesperson Dineo Sekgotodi says, “The reason for their appearance today is to set the High Court date and also submission of racketeering statements.” Joseph Nyalunga and Petros Mabuza known as Mr Big and their co-accused were arrested for allegedly contravening the firearms Control Act, conspiracy to commit crime and various Credit Act violations. The suspects were granted bail ranging from R10 000 to R120 000 in their last court appearance. Sekgotodi says, “The suspects were arrested last year September by members of Mpumalanga Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit.”
