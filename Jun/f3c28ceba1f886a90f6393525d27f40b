Authorities at the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) in the Eastern Cape are looking at strengthening security measures on all campuses following the death of two students on Saturday. Both students were fatally stabbed during a get together at the Mthatha campus. This is the second incident at the campus this year. In April, a student was allegedly assaulted by fellow students and thrown off a third-floor balcony. He was accused of being a member of a gang that was terrorising students and stealing cellphones and laptops. WSU spokesperson, Yonela Tukwayo says the institution is concerned.
