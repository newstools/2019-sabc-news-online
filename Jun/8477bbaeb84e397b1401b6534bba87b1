The former editor of the now defunct TV news channel ANN7, Rajesh Sundaram, is expected to testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Monday. Sundaram, who was brought to South Africa by the Gupta brothers in 2013 to work at the channel, published a book last year in which he linked former President Jacob Zuma directly to the establishment of ANN7. In the book “Indentured – Behind the Scenes at Gupta TV”, he also alleges that the channel lied to MultiChoice on its readiness to launch. According to the Commission, its legal team is in the process of identifying and consulting those who will be called to appear over the coming weeks.
