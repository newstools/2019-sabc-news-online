Human Rights Lawyer and activist who also sits on the board of the Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana, Pearl Magashula says the battle to decriminalise same-sex relations took 20 years.

LGBT activists throughout Africa met the ruling with an outpouring of joy. Speaking on SAfm’s Sunrise, Magashula says there are mixed reactions from the country’s citizens to the ruling.
