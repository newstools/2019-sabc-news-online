Civil Society group, Equal Education (EE), has written to parliament raising concerns over Zukisa Faku, former Executive Mayor of Buffalo City Municipality, being the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education. The letter which was addressed to African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Pemmy Majodina, calls on the ANC caucus to initiate the necessary processes to remove Faku because of fraud and corruption charges against her, related to the misuse of municipal funds. When Morning Live approached the ANC chief whip on the matter, she responded that the party has given Faku until Friday to give an update on her appeal case. Equal Education’s General Secretary Noncedo Madubedube says, “We are really worried and that’s why we make this big call for the withdrawal of Zukisa Faku as a Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education.” “A Chairperson of our Portfolio Committee cannot be someone charged with nine counts of fraud. A person that holds that position must hold the utmost integrity, in the same standard we hold ourselves as Equal Education or other members of Civil Society,” says Madubedube. However, Madubedube says Majodina hasn’t received the letter. “I don’t understand why because it has been directly sent to her and it’s copied to Thandi Modise and the Ethics Committee of the ANC.” Watch the full interview:
