The Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg is expected to hear closing arguments in the culpable homicide case of Duduzane Zuma on Thursday morning. Former President Jacob Zuma’s son is facing charges of culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving. This relates to a 2014 incident in which Zuma lost control of his Porsche 911 Turbo and crashed into a minibus-taxi on the M1 highway in Johannesburg resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube who was one of the passengers in the taxi at that time. During Zuma’s last court appearance in May, his lawyer called in a new witness, Michael Jankelowitz, who claimed to have been driving on the M1 highway on the night of the crash. He told the court that he saw Zuma’s car and that he wasn’t driving recklessly or over the speed limit. Another witness, Konrad Lotter, who’s an accident reconstruction expert, told the court that based on the damage caused to the taxi and Zuma’s Porsche, the collision couldn’t have occurred at a high speed.
