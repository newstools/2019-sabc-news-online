Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has urged the Youth to liberate their minds. Malema has emphasized that the 1976 generation was driven by Black Consciousness when they protested against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in schools. He has been addressing the Youth Day commemoration at the University of Fort Hare at Alice, in the Eastern Cape. Malema has urged students to take their studies seriously at all times. “We don’t want you to come and die here out of irresponsible activities you are engaged in. You are here to learn, make your African mother proud, make the African community proud by passing and graduating and leaving this place. Comrades you must know that when you pass and graduate you don’t do it for your family only, you are doing it for the whole village,” says Malema. Watch video below:
