A warrant of arrest has been issued for National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, by the Regional Court sitting in Potchefstroom in the North West. Modise was expected to appear in court on Friday morning on charges of animal cruelty. The case follows a successful private investigation conducted by Civil Rights Organisation, Afri- Forum’s private prosecution unit, on behalf of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA). This, allegedly after Modise left her farm unattended, causing the death of over 50 pigs and other animals due to lack of water and food. Afri-Forum’s Senior Special Investigator Elias Mangwale says, “There is no way whereby an accused person can stay away from court attendance, but we say we will postpone the matter further for the 22nd as we have agreed with the defence lawyer. The warrant of arrest has been issued in court today (Friday) and it is being held until the 22 July so that she can appear in court on that day.” The headline of this story has been changed to better reflect the content.
