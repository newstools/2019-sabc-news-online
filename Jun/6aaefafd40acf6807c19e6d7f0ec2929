Ford South Africa working with World Vision South Africa, have launched an innovative community water project. The two-year project will be based in Nelson Mandela Bay and focuses on the areas of Kwanobuhle and Uitenhage.  An atmospheric water generator is used to produce 900 litres of water per day and is a boon for people living in dry areas. Ford Managing Director, Neale Hill, says the generator will use moisture harnessed from air and convert it into water. “The opportunity for mobile water generation from air is a unit that harnesses the moisture that is contained in the air and converts it into water. It has the ability to filtrate it and ultimately the real benefit of it is that it provides a safe source of drinking water.” For many in informal settlements, access to water is a challenge. Such projects assist people in dire need to access this precious resource. hikondi Phiri form World Vision South Africa says the project will allow many families access to safe drinking water. “On a daily, basis it can make up to 900 litres. That means families and children will be accorded the opportunity to get clean and safe drinking water especially in emergency situations. It will benefit schools, clinics and areas that need safe drinking water.” Economic specialist, Dr Azar Jammine from Econometrix, believes that private sector co-operation is key. “Companies like Ford have a huge role to play in terms of trying to turn this around. And if the government were to participate more actively with Ford and other such large organisations, we could see a turn-around in the situation.”
