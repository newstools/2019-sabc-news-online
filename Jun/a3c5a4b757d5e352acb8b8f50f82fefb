South African Airways (SAA) and how it was captured will take centre stage again this week at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. Last week, former Head of Financial Risk ManagementÂ Cynthia Stimpel concluded her testimony. She gave damming evidence on how the SAA Board, under Dudu Myeni, failed to follow proper governance processes when they awarded an unknown company BNP capital a contract to source a R15-billion consolidation loan for SAA in 2015. She also told the commission how senior managers, who did not toe the line, were suspended. The commission will on Tuesday hear evidence from former SAA CFO Phumeza Nhantsi and Director of BNP capital Daniel Mahlangu. Last week, evidence leader Adv. Kate Hofmeyr told Judge Raymond Zondo that testimony for the next two weeks will centre on SAA. The commission is also expected to hear evidence on a transaction between the North West Department of Transport, South African express airways, the jet fuel procurement with SAA and SA express with EML energy. Evidence so far has shown how the Board broke rules to give contracts that number one favoured. Former SAA head of financial risk management Cynthia Stimpel told the State Capture Commission that she was suspended for fighting potential corruption. See video below:
