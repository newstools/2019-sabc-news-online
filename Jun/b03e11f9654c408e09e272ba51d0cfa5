The Inkatha Freedom Party’s (IFP) newly elected KwaZulu-Natal provincial chairperson, Thami Ntuli, says the leadership is clear about the revival of the party’s structures in the province. Ntuli was elected to the position during the IFP’s provincial elective conference in Ulundi in the north of the province. IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi nominated Ntuli for the position which Mbangiseni Yengwa also contested. The conference was supposed to have been convened in 2014 but was shelved due to factionalism and bogus branches in the party. Ntuli says, “We are clear about our mandate of reviving structures ensuring that in all corners of KwaZulu-Natal there are IFP activities because that is what we want to see. We also need to ensure that there are structures in preparation for the 2021 local government elections.” Watch a related video below:
