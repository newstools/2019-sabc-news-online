The ambulance personnel were responding to an alleged assault case in the area. “The paramedics together with the patient managed to evacuate the area unharmed. The services will remain suspended until the area is deemed safe for EMS personnel to render this essential service in the area,” says Emergency Services Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi.
