The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation says it has completed over 1 500 cases of fraud and corruption in government and these cases have officially been handed to the National Prosecution Authority (NPA), for possible prosecution. Forty nine of the cases are from the North West and allegedly involve high profile individuals. Close to 100 cases of corruption were investigated. 44 are being handled by the Special Investigative Unit, 49 more by the Hawks. Several departments are under the microscope. The Hawks also raided the Department of Agriculture, where State-owned farms were allegedly shared amongst politicians and officials. Former President Jacob Zuma allegedly received  R1.5 million worth of cattle meant for emerging farmers. Prominent officials and politicians, including the former MEC are also implicated in awarding themselves state cattle. At the North West Premier’s office, two Chief Directors are on suspension for irregular payments in relation to an ICT contract. “Anyone, who has played a role in feeding into corruption in the province must be held accountable from politicians and even service providers, in aiding corruption in the province as government we say whoever is involved must face the full might of the law,” says Hawks spokesperson Hanguani Molaodzi. The net should also be closing on politicians that may have had a hand in the alleged corruption. “All these corruption which were done in the province where influenced by politicians,” says Papiki Babuile, who is the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) North West secretary. Democratic Alliance (DA) Caucus leader, Winston Rabotapi, says the corrupt people are working behind the scenes. “We know of the people that are arrested are actually fronting, the actual doers of corruption are behind the scenes, they are only using these poor officials,” says Rabotapi. Meanwhile, NPA spokesperson, Bulela Makeke, refused to comment, as they say they do not discuss sensitive cases in public.
