The UN Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights have strongly condemned the military’s crackdown in Sudan. Soldiers opened fire on pro-democracy protestors camped outside the army headquarters, killing at least 13 people. Protesters are demanding the military hand over power to a civilian administration. UN Chief Antonio Guterres has strongly condemned the violence and reports of excessive force while his High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet deplored the use of live ammunition, including inside medical facilities, calling it extremely alarming. She stressed that those exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression must be protected. The Secretary-General reminded the military council that it was responsible for the safety and security of all Sudanese and called for an immediate investigation into developments on the ground and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. The AU’s Peace and Security Council has given the military a 60-day deadline which ends at the end of June to hand over power to a civilian-led transitional authority or face further punitive actions which could include sanctions.
