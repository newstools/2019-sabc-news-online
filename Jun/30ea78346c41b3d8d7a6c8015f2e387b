KwaZulu-Natal Educationa MEC Kwazi Mshengu says there is an urgent need for police deployment at public schools to help fight the increasing levels of violence. Mshengu was speaking at Umlazi Township, south of Durban, during the funeral service of a 48 year-old teacher who was shot dead at a school last week. Sbonakaliso Nyawose was killed by two unknown men at Masuku Primary school in Folweni south of Durban. Mshengu says he has called for an urgent meeting with the provincial Treasury and various government departments to see if there is enough budget to hire security guards. “We have commissioned a task team composed of department officials from education, community safety in the province as well as Treasury to come up with a clear plan of how to secure our schools.” “We are anticipating that we will work with all structures including the police. We want to have additional funding to deploy more security guards at the gates of our schools, we want to properly fence our schools so that there is a clear entrances as well as exits, so that we will control whoever comes and goes at our schools.” Related video click below:
