Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is among the people who will be testifying on Thursday at the Commission investigating allegations of maladministration and the possible violation of human rights in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The joint Alexandra Enquiry is held by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and the Office of the Public Protector in Braamfontein. The Enquiry has said it would expand its scope to include the demolitions that took place in the township last Friday. Yesterday, Johannesburg City Manager, Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni said the city accepts responsibility for the demolitions. Gauteng Manager Buang Jones says: “Today, we expect to hear or receive oral testimonies from the leader of the EFF Mr Julius Malema and his submission is in relation to land occupation and any information they have at their disposal concerning the Alexandra renewal project. We also expect to hear the oral testimony of the group head of forensics at the City of Johannesburg General Shadrack Sibiya as they have initiated their own forensic probe into the Alex renewal project.” Click below to watch the Alexandra Inquiry
