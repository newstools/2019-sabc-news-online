The African National Congress (ANC) has retained Ward 3 in the Emakhazeni Local Municipality in Mpumalanga. This follows by-elections on Thursday. Independent Electoral Commission Regional Supervisor in Nkangala, Tsepo Dibakoane says polls followed the resignation of an ANC Councillor. “We had a by-election in Emakhazeni in Ward 3. The by-election was contested by the ANC and the EFF. The ward was actually retained by the ANC. They won the Ward by 78% and the Councillor that contested the ward for the ANC was Emily Sonto Radebe. So, in other words, Emily Sonto Radebe is the new Councillor for Ward 3. The EFF got 22 % votes.”
