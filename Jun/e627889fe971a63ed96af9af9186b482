EFF leader Julius Malema is back in court on Friday. He’s charged with incitement to commit trespassing following his calls during EFF’s inaugural conference in 2014, that people should invade unoccupied open land. The case has been postponed on numerous occasions both in the Newcastle and Bloemfontein Magistrate Court. Malema made the statement in Madadeni, KwaZulu-Natal and further took it to his party’s elective conference in Bloemfontein. Subsequently, court appearances unfolded. Malema’s statements are in violation of Riotous Assemblies Act. He, however, challenged the constitutionality of the Act, arguing that it’s an apartheid era legislation. The Free State EFF Deputy Chairperson, Mahlomola Majake, says that they support their leader. “87% of land and we were left with 13%. The reason why he is taken to court is to crucify him because he is trampling on the white monopoly capital. We will never allow that. We will support our CIC.” Earlier in 2019, prosecution in the Madadeni Magistrate’s Court said the matter will be on hold pending the finalisation of Riotous Assemblies Act by the High Court in Pretoria. Legal expert, Lebogang Mokhelebelieves that the case is heading for more postponements. “The Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court cannot proceed and the issue, rather any judgement as far as the constitutionality of that act is concerned, is that the only court in South Africa would be the High Court or the Constitutional Court can declare on such (an) Act.” Malema has maintained his court appearances are a waste of taxpayers’ money and that it’s a political tactic for destruction of his career in politics.
