The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it remains unshaken and maintains that the Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane must go. On Friday, Mkhwebane called on the party’s first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila to retract his comments that she was a hired gun. While addressing the National Education, Health, and Allied Workers’ Union (NEHAWU) Policy Conference earlier this week, Mapaila is alleged to have labelled Mkhwebane a hired gun of the fight back agenda, who is used by rogue elements in the intelligence sector. Mkhwebane asked Mapaila to withdraw the remarks within five working days or face legal action.  But SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo says they are unrelenting on their position on Mkhwebane. Mashilo says they maintain that Mkhwebane must vacate office.  “Parliament must convene an inquiry into the fitness of the Public Protector to hold office.” Mkhwebane has threatened to take legal action against Mapaila should he be unable to withdraw his statement or furnish proof of his remarks.
