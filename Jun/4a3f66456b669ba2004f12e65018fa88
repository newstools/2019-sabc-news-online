The South African Cabin Crew Association has called on South African Airways CEO Vuyani Jarana to stay at the national airline. Jarana resigned on Sunday, citing the lack of progress on a turnaround strategy as the reason for his decision. The association has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, asking them to provide Jarana with all the support he needs as CEO. The association’s deputy president Christopher Shabangu says: “For the first time, we have a gentleman who was brought in for his intelligence and his acumen for this business. He understands this business. Now he is brought into a dead airline. But the employees can see now where we are going. The public might not see that but the employees can see where we are going. We working with an honest person, we’re working with a person who has a plan. What we are saying is that support the man. You’re the one that brought this man and now we believe in him. We do believe that he can do the job. Support him, give him the money. Give him the board that is going to be able to support the vision.” Click on related videos below:
