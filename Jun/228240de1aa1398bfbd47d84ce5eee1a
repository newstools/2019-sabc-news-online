The case against #FeesMustFall leader Mcebo Dlamini has been postponed to 4 July for a pre-trial conference at the Johannesburg Magistrateâ€™s Court. Dlamini is facing a number of charges including public violence, assault, theft and damage to property. He was arrested at his University of Witwatersrand residence in October 2016, during the protests for free higher education. Dlamini appeared briefly in the dock before his case was postponed . This comes after the Director of Public Prosecutions declined his representations to have the charges against him dropped. During his previous appearance, his attorney told the court that they had submitted new representations to the National Director for Public Prosecutions as he believes the charges Dlamini is facing are politically motivated. Dlamini says he will be making an application to the High Court for a permanent stay of prosecution.
