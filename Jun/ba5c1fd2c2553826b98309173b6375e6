Moqhaka Municipal Manager Mncedisi Mqwathi has been placed on precautionary suspension after he was granted R100 000 bail in the Kroonstad regional court in the Free State on Wednesday. He was arrested last week after being on the run from the Hawks. His arrest follows that of his counterpart at the Dihlabeng Local Municipality, Busa Molatseli. They are accused of awarding a security tender worth R34-million irregularly. The new Executive Mayor of Moqhaka Municipality Lucky Phooko says: “Part of the bail condition is that he should not contact any municipal employees and he must not be at the municipal building until his court case is completed by the court of law. So my view as the municipal executive is to emphasise that all the bail conditions are adhered to as from tonight.”
