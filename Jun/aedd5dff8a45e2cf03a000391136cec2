Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has shut down a primary school in Krugersdorp on the West Rand after a learner died and several others became sick with flu-like symptoms. A team of health officials have visited the Laerskool Kenmare and will advise the Education department on when to reopen the school. Lesufi says the learner died over the weekend. “Members of the Department of Health are making some investigations so we can determine if this is an ordinary flu (or) a different form of flu that has affected our learners. Fortunately, the majority of our learners have finished writing exams. So, as I am speaking to you now, the school has been quarantined and it is going to be under observation until (the) Department of Health advises otherwise.”
