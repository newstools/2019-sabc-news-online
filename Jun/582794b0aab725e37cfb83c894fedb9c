Hundreds of mourners have gathered at the Monatana Sports grounds at Ga-Phaahla village outside Jane-Furse in Limpopo where the funeral of six people is underway. They died after a head-on-collision on the R579 near Ga-Molooi. Transport MEC Dickson Masemola is amongst the mourners. The Department’s spokesperson Joel Seabi has urged motorists to be vigilant on the roads. “Quite an unfortunate situation like we always say, we are humbly requesting motorists on the road to really take caution when they travel along the road of the province.” Seabi adds: “Because if you look at the incident as well it is another head-on-collision and unfortunately amongst the six lives that were lost there was a two-month-old baby who could have been a future of this country.” Last weekend 21 people, who perished in what became known as the Maphalle 24, were also laid to rest in a mass funeral. They were travelling from a June 16 rally in an allegedly overloaded taxi, which collided head-on with a bus. Related video click below:
