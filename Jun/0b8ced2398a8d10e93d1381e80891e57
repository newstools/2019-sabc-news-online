Forest High School in Turffontein south of Johannesburg is set to reopen on Thursday morning. Classes were suspended after a learner was stabbed to death at the school earlier this week. A 19-year-old learner of the high school has been arrested and will be making a formal bail application in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court today. He appeared briefly in court yesterday where he was formally charged. He is facing one count of murder and two of attempted murder. Watch the video below for related news:
