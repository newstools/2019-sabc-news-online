The funeral service of former Eastern Cape MEC for Safety and Security, Thobile Mhlahlo, is  underway in Port Elizabeth. The struggle stalwart died two weeks ago after a short illness. He has been given a special provincial funeral. The South African Police Services (SAPS) brass band led the funeral procession to Nangoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton. Members of the security cluster and Mhlahlo’s old comrades formed a guard of honour as Mhlahlo’s coffin draped with the African National Congress (ANC)  flag, made its way to the hall. It’s the same hall that hosted funeral services of other struggle icons like Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba. Eastern Cape MEC for Finance, Mlungisi Mvoko, is expected to deliver the eulogy.
