The South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) in the Free State and their Lesotho counterparts have launched a campaign against violence in schools. A recent spate of violent attacks and murders have taken place in schools nationwide. The campaign coincides with the annual International Games between the two countries aimed at forging relations. The campaign is dubbed “I am a school fan” and will mobilise all stakeholders including parents, teachers, learners and government departments. SADTU provincial secretary, Mokholoane Moloi, says they have adopted Ikaelelo Secondary school in Bloemfontein, since it’s regarded as one of the violent schools.
