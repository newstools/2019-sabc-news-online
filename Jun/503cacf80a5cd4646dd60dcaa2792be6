The African National Congress’ (ANC) Dullah Omar region in the Western Cape is expected to meet with the community leaders of the Marikana informal settlement in Philippi on Sunday to discuss the ongoing service delivery issues in the area. Protests by the community quickly turned violent last week when some of the protesters started stoning vehicles on the R-300. The stone throwing resulted in a multi vehicle pile-up, which claimed the life of ANC member, Andiswa Ndlevu. A pedestrian was also killed. Two busses and eight vehicles, including a Western Cape traffic car were also petrol bombed. Spokesperson for the Dullah Omar Region, Nobukhosi Dlamini, says this cannot be tolerated. “We had arranged with the branch of Marikana that we were going to visit that branch to address the issues raised by the community members. After that arrangement had been made, the violent protests then broke out. We as the ANC want the people who were the instigators and perpetrators of that violence to be brought to book. We do support the community’s right to protest, however, we do not support the destruction of property,” says Dlamini. Meanwhile, Malibongwe Drive at Dunoon near Milnerton in Cape Town, has been closed between Potsdam Road and Parklands yet again due to protest action. Cape Town Traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhoudt says protesters have set tyres and rubble alight in the roads. Motorists are advised to make use of alternative routes.
