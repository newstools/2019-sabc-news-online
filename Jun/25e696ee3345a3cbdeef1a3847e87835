A security guard has been trampled to death by an elephant at the premises of Foskor Mine in Phalaborwa, in Limpopo. Foskor mine spokesperson, Malesela Mokhondo, says the deceased was an employee of a security company that has been contracted by Foskor Zirconia which operates in the premises. The Foskor Mine has been in the headlines lately after a pride of 14 lions were spotted in the area. The lions will on Saturday be darted and relocated from the mine. Mkhondo says they are currently in the process of informing the deceasedâ€™s next of kin. Watch video on escaped lions below:
