The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has referred the corruption case against three former South African Revenue Services (Sars) officials accused of corruption back to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The court has instructed former Sars Acting Commissioner, Ivan Pillay, Andries Janse van Rensburg and Johann van Loggerenberg to make representations to NPA head Shamila Batohi on why they should not be prosecuted. Batohi will then decide on whether the NPA will proceed with prosecuting the trio. Pillay, Van Rensburg and Van Loggerenberg are facing charges of corruption, including allegations of having been part of the revenue services so-called “rogue unit”, which allegedly spied on various high profile politicians.
