An attempt by an alleged drunk driver to flee from traffic officers ended with sjambok lashes and injuries for a Cape Town motorist. The incident happened on Sunday during a Ghost Squad operation in Eerste River. The City’s Mayco member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says the man scaled over a spiked wall and sustained cuts on his ribcage. He landed in a backyard where he was sjambokked by the property owner, who mistook him for an intruder. An officer pursuing the suspect intervened and arrested him. Smith says the suspect is one of 53 drunk driving suspects who were arrested over the weekend across the Metro. “What would have been a straight forward drunk driving case has now turned into a resisting arrest case, but also possible trespassing charges if the owner of the property decides to pursue the matter. This is not to mention the physical impact of the attempted getaway. I commend the traffic officer who didn’t give up and save the suspect from a potential consequence of being mistaken for an intruder,” says Smith.
