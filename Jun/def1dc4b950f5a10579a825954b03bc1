North West Premier Job Mokgoro, says he’s willing to co-operate with the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture should it subpoena him to appear before it. Mokgoro’s announcement comes after the provincial Community Safety and Transport Management Department’s Chief Financial Officer, Kutlwano Phatudi, mentioned him when she testified before the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Friday. Phatudi said the North West government paid SA Express R50 million before it concluded a deal with it. Mokgoro, who was the province’s Acting Director-General at the time, had allegedly authorised the payment. Mokgoro’s spokesperson Vuyisile Ngesi says,“The Premier is prepared to testify before the State Capture Commission of Inquiry based on the fact that the chief financial officer of the Department of Community Safety and Transport management made mention of him regarding a payment of almost R51 million that was made to Koroneka that he had to give a go ahead on at the time when he was still Acting Director General in the office of the Premier and the fifth administration.” Political analyst from the North West University, Professor Andre Duvenhage, says Phatudi’s revelations are an indication that corruption is rife in the province. “It’s indicating the content and the nature of State Capture within the province. The levels of corruption we are talking about R400 million that could be used in a number of ways. At the moment about 20 of our municipalities are under administration because they cannot deliver services in a proper way. The whole province can be described as a failed province and just think what we could have done with that money,” says Duvenhage.
