Former Tourism Minister, Derek Hanekom is the latest former cabinet member to resign his seat in Parliament. He follows on the heels of former Minister for Women in the Presidency, Bathabile Dlamini who resigned earlier on Tuesday. Hanekom’s resignation has been confirmed by the office of the African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip. On Tuesday, former ministers Jeff Radebe and Siyabonga Cwele also resigned. Last week, former members of the executive Thokozile Xasa, Dipou Letsatsi-Duba, Susan Shabangu and Nomaindia Mfeketo also resigned. The mass exodus follows after these individuals were not reappointed to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet. The resignations are reported to be in an effort to protect their ministerial pensions. About two weeks ago, Hanekom said he would remain a Member of Parliament despite not being appointed to the executive. This was after he was not included in the new Cabinet appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa almost two weeks ago. In March 2017, Hanekom was sacked during a late night Cabinet reshuffle by former President Jacob Zuma and also opted to remain a MP. Hanekom had led a move of no confidence in Zuma and for him to be recalled in November 2016 during a meeting of the African National Congress’s (ANC) National Executive Committee. He was reappointed Tourism Minister in February 2018 when Ramaphosa took over from a recalled Zuma. In a text message, Hanekom previously said he would not be doing any interviews about his future plans.  Watch a related video below:
