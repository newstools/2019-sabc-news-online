The African National Congress (ANC)  investigation into whether any party members supported the launch of other parties before the elections is expected to be completed within 60 days. ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has released the terms of reference for the independent team which will be led by former President Kgalema Motlanthe. The team will probe whether party members were involved in the setting up of smaller parties ahead of the 2019 elections. The decision to establish the team was taken after allegations that Magashule was involved in the formation of the African Transformation Movement. “The terms of reference outline the sort of work that this adhoc committee is expected to take forward. Of course they may invite people who could assist with information, people can also voluntarily appear before the adhoc committee. The expectation from the national working committee is that this work should be completed well within 60 days,” says ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe. Click below for more on the story:
