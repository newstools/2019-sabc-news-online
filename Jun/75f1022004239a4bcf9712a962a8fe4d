President Cyril Ramaphosa is heading to Lesotho this week. He will lead a delegation of South African officials on a working visit for bilateral relations between the two neighbours. While Ramaphosa’s visit will mainly focus on his role as a chairperson of the Southern Customs Union (SACU), he will also be engaging with his host, Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, on a wide range of bilateral issues, including progress made on Southern African Development Community (SADC) Recommended Reforms Progress. The visit is preceded by Retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke‘s, who has been appointed on behalf of President Ramaphosa as an ongoing SADC Facilitator to oversee Lesotho’s implementation of the Reforms Process that could lead the Mountain Kingdom to a more politically stable state.
