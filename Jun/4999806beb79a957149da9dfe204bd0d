Thousands of worshippers under the auspices of African Indigenous Churches filled-up Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg, all in the name of praying for peace, prosperity and development. The event was attended by clergy, former heads of state, NGO’s, women’s groups, traditional leaders and politicians. Dr Mathole Motshekga; Presidential Representative says: “There can be no better world without a better Africa. What we see today is the beginning of the creation of a better Africa and a better world.” The event was organised by the Inkululeko Yesizwe Association. Prophet Samuel Radebe; Inkululeko Yesizwe Association says: “Start with families if you want to build better communities. The family is the foundation of a sound society; hence you often see how a people that come from the strong families tend to do well in life.” The event also saw 50 couples exchange vows in a mass wedding presided over by Prophet Radebe. The day ended with the release of doves into the sky. This is a  gesture symbolic of a new beginning, peace and prosperity in South Africa and Africa. WATCH BELOW:
