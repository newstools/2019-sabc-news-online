It will also invest in projects to remove ‘thirsty’ invasive alien plants from five main water catchment areas that feed major cities and towns across the country, helping to replenish precious water into nature. The Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) is mobilising a range of non-governmental organisations to clear any species from these catchment areas. “Now this process  of clearing catchments in also very interesting process because it provides work opportunities for those who are involved in the clearing and very often these work opportunities are a great benefit to women, particularly women headed households and also benefiting people living in remote and marginalised communities where the form of employment available,” says Minister Barbara Creecy.
