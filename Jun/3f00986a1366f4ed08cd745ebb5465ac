A KwaZulu-Natal police officer was on Wednesday shot and killed during an alleged domestic dispute in Mpumalanga, west of Durban. 33-year-old Constable Thandiwe Mavaneni sustained multiple gunshot wounds when she was allegedly shot by a man believed to be her boyfriend while at her home in Mpumalanga. She was then rushed to hospital where she succumbed to gunshot injuries. A 26-year-old suspect was immediately arrested and the weapon was taken to ballistics. Provincial Spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the incident has left police officers from Mpumalanga and Inchanga police station traumatised. Mbhele says KZN police management sends its condolences to the family and friends of the constable. The suspect is expected to appear before the Mpumalanga Magistrates Court on charges of murder on Friday.
