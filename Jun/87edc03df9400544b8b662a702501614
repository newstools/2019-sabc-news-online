Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Caucus leader, Solly Msimanga, says they want to know how the scrapping of the controversial e-toll system will be finalised. Gauteng Premier David Makhura is expected to highlight the province’s priorities, including the e-tolling system, when he presents the State of the Province Address (SOPA) on Monday. On Saturday, African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip in the provincial legislature, Mzi Khumalo, said the caucus is still determined to see the scrapping of the e-tolling system. Msimanga says Makhura should focus on the speeding up of service delivery, but the party is eager to hear what he will say on e-tolls. “We want to hear also on how he’s going to fight corruption, deal with the issue of safety in schools and maintenance of school infrastructure. I also want to hear how he’s going to deal with the issues of e-tolls because they said that they were going to ensure that the issue of e-tolls it is indeed finalised,” says Msimanga.
