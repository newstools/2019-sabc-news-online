The case against #FeesMustFall leader Mcebo Dlamini is expected to continue in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Dlamini faces multiple charges including public violence, assault, theft and damage to property. He was arrested at the University of the Witwatersrand residence in October 2016 during the protests for free education. Dlamini was initially denied bail, but this decision was overturned by the Johannesburg High Court. During his last appearance, Dlamini’s council Tembeka Ngcukaitobi told the court that he will be making fresh representations to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) since there is now a new National Director of Public Prosecutions. Ngcukaitobi will be trying to convince the NPA to drop the prosecution; claiming it was politically motivated. Watch the video below for more:
