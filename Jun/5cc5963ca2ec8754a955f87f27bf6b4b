As the country observes child protection week, a 48-year-old man appeared at Ezingolweni Magistrateâ€™s Court for the second time for allegedly repeatedly raping his 17-year-old daughter since she was four years of age. The young girl was allegedly impregnated by her father. It is also alleged that he would give her his bank card after raping her, to keep her from reporting the abuse. She reported the rape to the police in February this year. But the man has denied the allegations. He told court on Monday that he is financially supporting his children including the 17-year-old. The matter has been postponed to Friday. Click below for more on child protection week:
