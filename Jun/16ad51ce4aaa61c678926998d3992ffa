The High Court in Bloemfontein has dismissed with costs an application by disgruntled Free State African National Congress (ANC) members. The group wanted the court to declare invalid the party’s 2018 provincial elective conference, citing widespread irregularities. The group’s spokesperson, Monnapule Ntamo, says they will appeal the matter. “We are very disappointed obviously but this is what we expected basically from the Bloemfontein High Court because we remain resolute that the court is really captured.” “We were not expecting any positive outcomes by the way. So our consideration is to check whether it’s practicable to go straight to petition the Appeal Court or must we go straight to the Constitutional Court, now we just consulting with our lawyers for that advice.” Related video click below:
