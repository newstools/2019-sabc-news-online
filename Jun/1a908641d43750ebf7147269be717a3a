The Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, has declined a request by the Democratic Alliance (DA) for a debate of national importance on Eskom’s financial crisis. DA’s spokesperson on Public Enterprise, Natasha Mazzone, says with many South Africans already battling financially, and poor economic growth, the situation at the power utility can not be allowed to continue. She says the DA believes that through a debate, workable solutions can be put on the table. The party wants Eskom divided in two entities – one responsible for power generation and another for distribution.
