A group of learners from various schools in Cape Town have marched against climate change. The learners, affiliated to the African Climate Alliance, are demanding that government declare the phenomenon an emergency. Convenor, Ruby Sampson, says authorities should do their part to address the issue . ” I am demanding from the South African government specific things, the whole strike today it’s for these things. The first one is that South Africa declares a climate crisis, the second one is that a moratorium is put on all new coal, oil and gas mining licenses, the third was is that the electricity sector here in South Africa becomes hundred percent renewable.”
