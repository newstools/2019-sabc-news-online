Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko has established a task team to investigate whether charges can be re-instated in the Vlakfontein family murder case. Mazibuko met with the community following a protest in the area after charges against Fita Khupe, one of the suspects in the murder of seven family members, were dropped. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said the prospects of the case diminished after the death of Ernest Mabasa who was the second suspect. Mazibuko’s spokesperson Pinkie Numa says the MEC is also meeting with various institutions over the matter. “The MEC is in the process of engaging the Justice Ministry, she was expected to have a conversation with the DPP of south Gauteng and also she will further consult with the Minister. She will find out what the options are of getting the charges against Fita Khupe re-instated.” Related video click below:
