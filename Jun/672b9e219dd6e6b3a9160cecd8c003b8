Broadcaster MultiChoice has announced that it will shedding more than two-thousand jobs in a retrenchment drive. The bulk of affected employees are in the call and service centres. Group CEO, Calvin Mawela, says the retrenchments are part of restructuring that he claims will allow for new roles to be available. However union Information Communications Technology Union (ICTU) says they were surprised to learn of these developments and have labelled the process illegal. Spokesperson, Thabang Mothelo, says they’re seeking further engagement with MultiChoice on the matter. “The law says section 189 says once the employer contemplates to retrench it needs to consult the trade union.  We’d like the employer to correct the procedure and call the union on board and have consultations. We have given the employer 48 hours from Monday to hold the retrenchment process through the labour court,” says Mothelo.
