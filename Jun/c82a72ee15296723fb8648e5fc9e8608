Former editor of the ANN 7 TV News Channel, Rajesh Sundaram has told the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that the Guptas wanted then President Jacob Zuma to make sure his ministers attend televised “New Age” Breakfasts amid national outrage around the Waterkloof saga. The Gupta’s wedding guests were allowed to land at the national key point in 2013. After the Waterkloof incident, Sundaram says there was reluctance from some ministers to attend ‘The New Age’ Breakfasts. The Breakfasts are alleged to have cost the SABC millions of rands to host but the Guptas apparently made a handsome profit. Sundaram says some of Zuma’s cabinet ministers did not want to be associated with the Guptas. Sundaram also says although Duduzane Zuma was the director, it was former President Jacob Zuma who was more actively involved in the meetings on the status of the TV project. The TV Channel owned by the Gupta family was established in 2013 and MultiChoice terminated its broadcast contract in 2017. Sundaram told the State Capture Commission that confidential information was shared with former President Zuma and that he later found out that Zuma had “a much bigger” interest. Click video below:
