Disgruntled African National Congress (ANC) members from various branches in the Mogalakwena sub-region in Limpopo have protested outside the party’s regional office in Mokopane. The protesters are demanding  membership audit files. They say they are worried that members from their branches are being sidelined for the upcoming Women’s League regional and provincial conferences. “We are here at the ANC office to file so that we can get memberships and give them to members of the Women’s League. They have decided to lock the office so that us as secretaries of twenty-one branches, we must not access files,” says one of the protesting  members, Wisani Sithole.
