KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has called on law enforcement authorities to investigate the circumstances that led to the killing of a teacher at the Masuku Primary in Folweni, south of Durban on Tuesday. The 48-year-old teacher, Sbonakaliso Nyawose, was shot and killed allegedly by an unknown man within the school premises. The man allegedly entered the school premises on Tuesday morning and fired multiple shots at the teacher who was walking down a passage at the time. He was hit in the head and abdomen. Mshengu described the incident as a barbaric and heartless act. He says, “The issue of safety in our schools is really one issue that is in our priorities. We will be working with the MEC for Safety in the province to ensure that our schools become the environment that is safe for teachers as well as learners. We want to send our deepest condolences to the Nyawose family.” Click below to watch related video:
