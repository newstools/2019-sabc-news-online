Veteran SABC broadcaster, Mduduzi Hlophe has been described as an unsung hero within the broadcasting industry. Hlophe died this week at his home in Soweto at the age of 75. He presented Zulu news bulletins on SABC 1. Hlophe distinguished himself as a respected radio drama producer and radio sports presenter. He retired from the SABC in the 1990s and is survived by his son and daughter. Family and friends of the late Hlophe packed the St Peter Claver Church in Pimville, Soweto, to pay their last respects. Speaker after speaker described how Hlophe was committed to changing the face of the media industry during the Apartheid era. Hlophe started his career in the broadcast industry in the 1960s at Radio Bantu which later became known as Ukhozi FM. His son, Ntuthuko Hlophe, says the family lost a pillar of strength. “My father was a good man. There was always peace when he’s around. As his family, we will dearly miss him. He would guide with many things about life. He made things happen. We are here because of him.” Hlophe’s nephew, Dumisani Hlophe, says his uncle’s advices made him the man he is today. “His advices were the best. He used to advise us that we should respect other people. He used to say ‘everything you do, people are looking at you. Try by all means to do the right things and be an example.’ He was a very good father and mentor.” Hlophe’s former colleague, Zama Masondo says he was introduced to the broadcasting industry by him. “We are where we are now because of him and all the advices that he gave us. We stuck with them and he encouraged us to acquire education and that’s what we did. And he told us that never give up on yourself. We shall always miss him and his advices.” Hlophe has been laid to rest at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
