The Hawks have confirmed a separate investigation into eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, this time on whether or not she breached her current bail conditions. Gumede is out on R50 000 bail, facing fraud and corruption charges, this in relation to R208 million sanitation tender. Gumede is charged alongside with 11 others. The case in question involved four suppliers who were not on the municipality’s database. It’s alleged the companies and senior municipal officials, conspired to benefit from the refuse removal tender. They were allegedly also not registered as waste management companies; neither did they have the necessary resources to execute the services. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says:”What we have picked up is that there are a lot of allegations that were brought to our attention and those allegations are now subjects of an investigation.” “The NPA investigating team will assess the allegations  as well as the investigation response hence then a decision will be taken on whether to take this back to court or another way to deal with the matter.” Over the past month there have been numerous calls for her to step down. Gumede’s fate as mayor is now in the hands of the African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal. A decision is expected to be taken by the PEC this weekend. Click video below:
