Motorists traveling between Johannesburg and Durban have been advised to try and avoid the N3-highway at night. The N3 Toll Concession company issued the warning following a number of incidents during which the highway was blockaded and vehicles looted or closed because of service delivery protests. N3TC commercial manager, Con Roux, also urged motorists to check the conditions on the road before they leave on their journey. He has asked people to report any suspicious activity along the N3 – such as stationary vehicles or groups of people gathering on the side of the road. “If they happen to be traveling along the N3 toll route, for which we are responsible, we asking them to report that immediately to report that to our 24/7 customer care line, and that number is 0800-634357, or else to tweet it on our twitter feed, which is @N3 route.” Referring to the recent blockades of the N3 by truck drivers, Roux said the N3TC supports engagement between the parties including the Minister of Transport, owners of trucking companies and organisations representing truck drivers. Groups of South African truck drivers are objecting to companies employing foreign drivers as alleged cheap labour. Roux says the causes of these protests should be addressed. “And so we do certainly add our voice to those who are asking that those talks be addressed carefully and mindfully.”
