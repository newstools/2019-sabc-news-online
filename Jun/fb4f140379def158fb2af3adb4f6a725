The Democratic Alliance (DA) is to set up an Independent Organisational Review panel. This panel will be tasked to review the party’s ability to build a democratic alternative to the African National Congress (ANC). The review will assess the party’s performance during the elections. DA leader Mmusi Maimane addressed the media after the DA’s Federal Council. The DA  lost close to 3% in the national vote. Most of those votes went to a resurgent Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus). Now the party has opted for a review – a decision welcomed by its Federal Council. Maimane says the DA will work tirelessly to regain lost voters. “The review will investigate the party’s objectives,” says Maimane. The panel will include a number of other independent members to be announced over the course of the next week. Consultations will continue until the next council meeting in October. The DA also announced the stepping down of the party’s Federal Executive Chair James Selfe. On Helen Zille the party’s leadership was reluctant to say if any action will be taken against her. She has notoriously tweeted on black privilege and colonialism ruffling the party’s feathers. Zille tweeted that black privilege was the ability to loot a country of billions and be re-elected. Maimane says the party will continue to hold those in power accountable. WATCH BELOW:
