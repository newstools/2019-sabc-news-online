Free State police are investigating a case of culpable homicide after five people died in a collision between several cars near Bloemfontein. Police spokesperson, Martin Xuma says a Toyota hillux double cab with Lesotho registration was heading to Bloemfontein. “It is alleged that it got a tyre burst and collided with two oncoming bakkies – one white Isuzu bakkie as well as a white Nissan NP200. At the moment we have four ladies that have died, and one male. Several people were taken to hospital for treatment – and a case of culpable homicide will be investigated.” An eyewitness in the deadly crash on the infamous N-Eight stretch outside Botshabelo in the Free State has revealed the terrifying events that lead to the carnage – including an apparent tyre problem. Limpho Rakhoba says she was driving behind a bakkie which collided with the two oncoming vehicles from Bloemfontein, killing five people. Several people were taken to hospital. Rakhoba explains what she saw before the fatal crash: “I was going to Bloemfontein and I saw a car in front of me. It was a 4×4 twin cab and then I saw something weird with the wheel at the back, I tried to flick the lights, however, I think the driver did not see me… not even a minute later the car started to roll, I just closed my eyes and when I opened my eyes again I saw 12 people lying on the road.”
