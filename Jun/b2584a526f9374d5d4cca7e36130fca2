The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) says it intends to take the Auditor General’s report to the Public Protector for investigation – after it was revealed that 239 out of 257 municipalities have not received clean audits. Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu addressed the media on Wednesday on the local government audits for the 2017/18 financial year – saying that pervasive control and monitoring failures are behind only 18 municipalities receiving clean audits. He says not a single municipality in the Free State, Limpopo and the North West received a clean audit – and that irregular expenditure among municipalities amounted to R25 billion. Samwu’s General Secretary, Koena Ramotlou says: “There are people who have used municipalities as a breeding ground for corruption. We cannot accept that 92% of municipalities cannot be able to get a clean audit. The past three years’ reports, we are going to take them to the Public Protector. On the basis of the findings of the AG, we must allow the PP to follow the money. We must recoup monies that was there so the PP can have remedial action taken against them.”
