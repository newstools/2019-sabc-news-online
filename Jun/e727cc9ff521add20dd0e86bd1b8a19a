Limpopo Economic Development MEC, Thabo Mokone is expected on Saturday afternoon to lead a team of rangers who will dart and relocate a pride of 14 lions that have been on the loose in the premises of Foskor Mine in Phalaborwa. The pride has been located and confined to a safe space by rangers. Economic Development spokesperson Zaid Kalla, however, says it is not yet clear where the lions will be relocated to. “We do have a good working relation with all wildlife facilities so we will talk to them but it doesn’t necessarily mean we will force the facilities to take the animals if they don’t feel at this particular moment to accommodate them. We are hoping that with the MEC present, there will be able to announce and inform us exactly as where they will be taken to and when.” Click on the video below:
