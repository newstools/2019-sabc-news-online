The 30-year-old man who is accused of the attempted rape of an intern doctor at the Pelonomi hospital in Bloemfontein is expected to apply for bail in the local magistrate’s court on Friday. He was arrested last week at the National Hospital in the city where he was seeking medical help after the 24-year-old victim bit off his tongue during the attack. He is facing a charge of attempted rape. She was almost raped while on duty in the early hours last week. Following that, hospital staff downed tools demanding their safety to be prioritised. The doctors in solidarity with the intern handed over a memorandum of demands to the provincial department of health. Health minister, Dr. Zweli Mkhize visited Pelonomi hospital and said his department has prioritised security upgrades at all health care centres in the country. Meanwhile, another incident happened at Pelonomi hospital, where a doctor was attacked and robbed off her cellphone at the hospital’s parking lot. Click on video below:
