The continued delays by the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee to establish a provincial structure in North West, to monitor the performance of the provincial government, may have a dire impact, on efforts to resuscitate the province. Alliance partners Cosatu, South African Communist Party (SACP) and Sanco have bemoaned the current leadership vacuum. The term of the Provincial Task Team (PTT),  led by Obed Bapela and Mamoloko Kubayi-Ngubani, ended just after the general elections. Cosatu’s Solly Lekhu and SACP’s Smuts Matshe say with the province under administration, and two thirds of its municipalities stripped of its powers, there’s a need for a constant political monitoring of government performance. “Currently, it’s very awkward that government has to operate without a mandate of a constitutional structure. It’s one of the issues that are important, thus for example, are supposed to deal with serious allegations as part of their responsibility,” says Matshe. “We remain concerned that the ANC doesn’t have a structure that can lead the province and be able to monitor the work government is doing and we are worried that there hasn’t been any communication on what causes the delay,” says Lekhu. North West-based Political Analyst Professor Andre Duvenhage thinks otherwise. “I believe in a way that is positive. Rather give it more time, making better decisions, taking the province forward because we know there are major challenges in all levels of government. So, in that sense, we need strong decisions and stability,” says Duvenhage.
