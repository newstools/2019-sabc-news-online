A high-level delegation of Presidents, invited guests and the media has begun to trickle into the conference venue of the 14th G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, for the start of the Group of 20 Presidency meeting. The opening session is expected to start at eight thirty in the morning on Friday, Japan local time, which is seven hours ahead of South Africa. It is expected that the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China will take centre stage. High on the agenda are discussions on inequality, sustainable development goals, the digital economy, climate change and international financial stability. The Japanese government has tightened security in and around the conference venue of the G20 summit.  All roads leading into the conference venue have been closed. A heavy police contingent and self-defence force have been dispatched to areas in and around the meeting venue.  The G20 meeting consists of leaders from 20 of the world’s most advanced and emerging market economies.
