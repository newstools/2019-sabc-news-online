The Alexandra Total Shutdown Movement has expressed disappointment over the City of Johannesburg‘s decision to rebuild the 80 houses demolished in Alexandra. Members of the movement say they are opposed to the rebuilding of structures which were demolished last Friday. Alexandra Shutdown Committee Convener, Sandile Mavundla says should the City of Johannesburg fail to address the mushrooming of illegal dwellings along the Jukskei River, there will be another massive shutdown in Alexandra. “The community of Alexandra raises concerns. If the Mayor is continuing with the illegal structures, which means he will be promoting that people must grab the land and build on illegal land, that is on the side-line. There are people in the Jukskei River. They need to be relocated. They would have to be considered first than the people who are still in the government waiting list since 96/97 with the c-form? There’s going to be a mass action if we see any illegal structure in Alexandra because it’s unconstitutional to build an illegal structure.” Click below for more on Alexandra:
