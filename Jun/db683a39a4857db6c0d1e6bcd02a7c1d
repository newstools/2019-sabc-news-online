The ANC Youth League in the Free State has thrown its weight behind ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule. The move follows reports that Magashule will be probed for his alleged involvement in the formation of the African Transformation Movement (ATM). The panel that will be investigating the claims will reportedly be led by Kgalema Motlanthe. In a statement, the Free State ANC youth wing dismissed claims of the looming investigation as a witch hunt. It also rejected it as an attempt to curb the ANC Secretary General’s powers. The Youth League says people like Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan are the ones who should be investigated. It cites the Public Protector’s report on Gordhan as reason for the suggestion. The League also criticised Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and the ANC head of economic transformation Enoch Godongwana for contradicting Magashule on resolutions of the governing party’s highest decision-making structure, the NEC, on the South African Reserve Bank. The Free State ANCYL says Magashule is the ruling party’s official empowered to communicate the views of the organisation. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
