SAA Express executive Brian Van Wyk has asked the State Capture Commission to postpone his testimony. Van Wyk’s council Nqabayethu Buthelezi says his client did not received the rule three-three notices where he has been implicated by certain witnesses. On Thursday the commission heard how the North West government signed a deal with SA Express which was signed off by the airline’s executives, Van Wyk and Inati Ntshanga. The North West department of transport paid SA Express inflated rates to operate the province’s Mafikeng and Pilanesberg airports. This was higher than industry standards. The deal signed in 2015 alleged to have failed procurement irregularities. SA Express commercial manager, Arson Phiri told the commission money paid by the North West government to SA express were “excessive” and “overstated”. The commission’s legal team says they did all they could to contact Van Wyk and notified him that he has been implicated at the commission. Judge Raymond Zondo has allowed the evidence to continue saying that the commission has a set date to complete its hearings. Judge Zondo told the council for Van Wyk to apply for leave to cross examine. He is also disputing evidence of a tape recording where he has been implicated in corrupt activities. Click video below:
