Access to quality healthcare services still remains a dream for some people of the Eastern Cape as the department of health struggles to fill vacant posts for nurses and doctors. The department has summoned managers and CEO’s of hospitals to East London to come up with a lasting solution to the problem. An affected patient, Vuyelwa Bokweni says lack of adequate medical staff in public health institutions should be addressed with speed. “We stay here in hospital for very long hours waiting for services, but the service is very poor because there is shortage of doctors and nurses. “Sometimes we are forced to go back home because the number that the doctors take is very limited because there are no doctors. There is a gross shortage of doctors,” says Bokweni.
