Former editor of the now defunct ANN7 TV news channel, Rajesh Sundaram, says there was an expectation for employees loyal to the Gupta brothers to touch their feet as a sign of respect. Touching the feet of elders is an age-old Indian tradition that is considered to be a mark of respect, however, it’s not common practice in a professional environment. Sundaram was testifying at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg on Monday. He is due back at the inquiry on Tuesday, where he is expected to continue detailing damning allegations against the brothers and former president, Jacob Zuma. Sundaram says he believes people were expected to affirm their loyalty to the Guptas at ANN7 TV channel. “You know, in a family set up, sons routinely touch the feet of their parents or their uncles and aunts but it is generally not a done thing in an office or professional environment. But what I found there was that people were supposed to reaffirm their loyalty to the Gupta brothers by touching their feet, especially the loyalists like Chawla would touch the brothers’ feet every time that he saw them,” says Sundaram.
