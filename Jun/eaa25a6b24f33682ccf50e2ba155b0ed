The Gauteng Human Rights Commission’s Manager, Buang Jones has warned that threats made against his life will not deter him from continuing with investigations into alleged corruption in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The Human Rights Commission and the office of the Public Protector are expected to convene the third session of the inquiry on Monday – looking into possible human rights violations, maladministration, abuse of power and corruption by officials – following service delivery protests in the area. Jones says despite the threats, he is determined to forge ahead with the probe. “I have reported this to my line managers at the HRC, I will not let this hold me down. I am more determined to serve our people, ensuring that we continue to act without fear, favour or prejudice – as we receive more evidence which will assist the commission in making a determination on whether there were human rights violations and what needs to be done to address the needs of the people of Alexandra.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/695277">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
