The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has heard that there was a break down of governance when former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba took over management at South African Airways (SAA). Gigaba was appointed Public Enterprises Minister in 2010. Former SAA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Siza Mzimela told the commission that there was proper communication and ethics when former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan was in charge. She says that Gigaba wanted the ministry to have more power in the appointments of CEOs at the State owned airline. “In the case of SAA, it was clear that the Board would make the appointment of the CEO. But his general concern is that he felt that the SAA did not give enough power to the ministry,” says Mzimela. Watch related video below:
