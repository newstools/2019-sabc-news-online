The Democratic Alliance (DA) controlled Tshwane Metro is to renovate a warehouse that could be used by homeless people, as police investigate whether a serial killer is on the loose following five deaths in the city. Police are yet to make arrests in connection with the killings. Homeless people in Tshwane currently live under bridges, on the pavement, or in abandoned buildings and parks. Member of the Mayoral Committee responsible for Social Development in the City of Tshwane Sakkie De Plooy says the municipality has stepped in. “We had discussions with the mayor and we identified a warehouse that we are going to renovate, you see we will get the keys and everything by Monday. We couldn’t use it before; it was used for other purposes, so the other departments of the city who were using it are now leaving, so it’s now available to us.”
