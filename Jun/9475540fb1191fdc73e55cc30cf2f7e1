The Cape Town Weather Office has issued a warning of gale force winds with a strong chance of runaway veldfires in most parts of the Western Cape on Monday. A cold front made landfall over Sunday night and brought with it rough seas. Forecaster Lebogang Makgati says the rain expected is not significant, but cold temperatures are expected to follow the cold front. Makgati says the Breede River Valley, Central Karoo, and Southern Cape areas are most at risk of veldfires due to the windy conditions. “Winds are expected to be reaching 60 to 80 km/h. We also have a warning out for possible veldfire conditions. There are dry and warm conditions ahead of this cold front. This may make conditions favourable for the development of runaway fires. We urge the public to take the necessary precautions,” says Makgati.
