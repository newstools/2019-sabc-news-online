EFF leader Julius Malema’s case for contravening the Riotus Assemblies Act of 1956 has been postponed to November 8, 2019 to allow the High Court in Pretoria sufficient time to deal with and finalise the Riotous Assemblies Act matter. Malema is challenging the act as the apartheid era legislation. He’s also facing a charge of encouraging his party members to occupy vacant land during its elective conference in 2014 in Bloemfontein. Meanwhile, his defence team has made a request that their client be excused for the next proceeding as the outspoken opposition leader faces similar charges in the New Castle Magistrate’s Court. The State has not objected to the request. Malema addresses supporters outside court After his court appearance Malema met party supporters who gathered outside the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court to support their leader. “The struggle for the land is a long strong struggle. It needs dedication. It’s going to take generations after generations. We might be imprisoned or go to jail or subjected to pay money. Every time such rulings are made against us, you must know that it is not a ruling against the leadership, it’s against the struggle for the land,” Malema said. He also said: “The judiciary is about to be captured. I am warning you now.”
