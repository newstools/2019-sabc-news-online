The African National Congress (ANC) National Working Committee (NEC) will this week announce the names of new provincial leaders in the North West. ANC national spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says there is urgency in dealing with the challenges in North West, given the complexity of factions within the party in the province. The mother body disbanded the former Provincial Executive Committee led by Supra Mahumapelo and replaced it with a temporary provincial task team, led by incumbent Premier Job Mokgoro. However, the last structure was disbanded to make way for a new one, which only ran until the elections. Mabe explains… “At the next meeting the National Working Committee (NWC) or the NEC, would have to process such matters and will ensure that there’s stability in the province. It’s quite urgent that there’s political stability in the North West.”
