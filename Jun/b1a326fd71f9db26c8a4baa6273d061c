The National Freedom Party (NFP) is the latest party to raise concerns on e-tolls ahead of Gauteng Premier, David Makhura’s State of the Province Address (SOPA) on Monday. On Saturday, the African National Congress (ANC) Caucus in the Gauteng Legislature said it was still determined to see the scrapping of the e-tolling system while Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Caucus leader, Solly Msimanga earlier on Sunday said they wanted to know how the controversial system would be scrapped. NFP Gauteng Deputy Secretary Dlangezwa Mvelase says the party also wants to see the creation of jobs in the province. “We are expecting him to give us reasons as to why the e-tolls have not been scrapped. We want to see the creation of employment being improved in the province. Our youth are not working. We want to hear him talking about Eskom and also the electricity in the province because we are having a huge problem of electricity in the province.” For a related video, click below:
