The defence team in the trial of Former North West Deputy Police Commissioner, William Mpembe, and three senior officials have told the High Court in the province that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) failed to discharge its constitutional duties after the Marikana tragedy. The lawyers say IPID failed to visit 259 arrested Marikana mine workers. Mpembe, and his three accused, are on trial for allegedly concealing the death of one of the 34 miners who died in a hail of police automatic gunfire in 2012. They are also facing charges of failing to disclose this at the Farlam Commission that probed the tragedy. Â The evidence by the state witness, who is the IPID principal investigator, was shredded by the defence, during a lengthy cross examination with the defence asserting that, the deceased worker did not die in custody, as the state alleges. The state witness earlier, confirmed photos of the deceased miner, taken from police custody, as opposed to the information of police dockets that, he died along with 34 mine workers at the scene of the shooting. The court remained full with families of the accused and residents from Marikana in attendance. More witnesses from IPID are expected to be called to the stand. Click below for more on the story:
