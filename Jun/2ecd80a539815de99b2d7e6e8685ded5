The Vlakfontein community, south of Johannesburg, is up in arms following the withdrawal of multiple murder charges against, Fita Khupe. The 61-year-old faced seven counts of murder for allegedly killing 7 Khoza family members in October 2018. His co-accused 27-year-old Ernest Mabaso took his own life in jail in January 2019. He had confessed to being involved in the murders and had fingered Khupe as the mastermind. The National Prosecuting Authority’s Gauteng Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says the state couldn’t prove beyond reasonable doubt that Khupe was behind the killings. She says Mabaso’s death had a devastating effect on the case, as prosecutors are prohibited by the law to use Mabaso’s confession as evidence in court. Mjonondwane says witnesses, who gave information to the police, couldn’t link Khupe to the murder. However, the community is having none of that. Residents are protesting in the area, demanding justice for the Khoza family. The community has blocked the Golden Highway. The police are on the scene to make sure that no motorists are affected and that the protest is peaceful. Watch residents’ response to the Vlakfontein ruling:
