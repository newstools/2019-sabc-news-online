Three university vehicles have been set alight, allegedly by protesting students at the Zamukulungisa campus of the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. Disgruntled students have been protesting since last Monday due to the non-payment of allowances and tuition fees by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). University Spokesperson, Yonela Tukwayo says the university has implemented the standing court interdict to ensure the safety of staff and students at the institution. “We have now moved to get the students out of the university so that we can be able to regain control of the campus and we are hoping that we will able to resolve all issues later on this week. We were scheduled to start exams today but now we have decided as management to move exams to next week,” says Tukwayo.
