The Department of Communications says National Treasury is considering the SABC’s request for a R3.2 billion loan guarantee. SABC Chief Financial Officer, Yolande van Biljon, on Monday warned of the possibility of a communication blackout amid the public broadcaster’s dire financial situation. She says the cash-strapped public broadcaster is stuck with large debts, including to the City of Johannesburg municipality. Van Biljon says executives are doing their best to avoid a Day-Zero scenario and that salaries are expected to be paid at the end of June. Communications acting DG, Nomvuyiso Batyi, says the SABC’s application is not the only pending application to Treasury. “It was submitted by the SABC to us and National Treasury is considering it. This is not the only application pending in treasury. Yolande’s interview did mention that they had submitted information, but there is a lot of toing and froing with things that are outstanding that we require from you.” LISTEN TO AUDIO BELOW: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/701001">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
