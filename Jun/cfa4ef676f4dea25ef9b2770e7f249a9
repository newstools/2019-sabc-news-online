The attorney for axed Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Nomgcobo Jiba, says his client may consider reviewing the Mokgoro Enquiry report. Zola Majavu was speaking after the Constitutional Court dismissed the application by the General Council of the Bar to have Jiba and her colleague Lawrence Mrwebi, struck off the roll of advocates. Jiba and Mrwebi were fired from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) by President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this year. Handing down a unanimous judgment, Justice Chris Jafta said the court does not have the jurisdiction to make a ruling on the matter. “At the moment it is a fact that the parliamentary process hasn’t happened. We can’t chase that. But as and when it happens – and we don’t want to pre-empt the outcome thereof – realistically we can accept that she is going to be fired. When that happens, the 12-6 process becomes finalised. We hold instructions to then take the Mokgoro Report on review. It is something that we couldn’t have done before the ConCourt had pronounced. Now that the ConCourt has pronounced, we can polish up the version of the review application that we had already started preparing a few weeks ago,” says Majavu. Watch a related video below:
