The Commission for Gender Equality has confirmed that it will be investigating claims in some departments and municipalities in the Eastern Cape that allegedly offer jobs and houses for sex. This follows the complaints which were raised by the DA women’s league in April. It’s alleged that some victims came forward claiming that they were forced to sleep with officials in order to get houses or jobs. Acting Chairperson for the Commission, Tamara Mathebula says they are assessing all the information brought to them. The commission is expected to contact all the people involved in these claims and make an assessment on how best to proceed with a possible investigation. In a statement from the DA in the province, the shocking practice of demanding sex-for-houses is prevalent in Queenstown, where three young women claim that they slept with Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality officials to receive RDP houses. In New Life Reeston, East London, some EPWP workers approached the party claiming that they had to sleep with officials to get jobs.
