International Relations Minister, Naledi Pandor says there’s no justification for serious action against Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela for her tweets that sparked an uproar on social media recently. Some critics had slated Mandela’s comments as racist. The minister says Mandela confirmed during their telephone conversation that those were indeed her tweets. Pandor says she has asked Mandela to observe their policy guiding officials in public service on their conduct. “I do a believe that she listened to what I said and to the fact that I believe a diplomat must really have due regard both to the content and form of communication they engage in and should she show, which I expect that indeed our conversation was worthy and that she’ll uphold our expectations, I do not believe from our side at this moment further action is merited.”
