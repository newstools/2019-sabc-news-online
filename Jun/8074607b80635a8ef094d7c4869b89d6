Former President, Jacob Zuma,  has confirmed that he will appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The commission last week asked Zuma to appear before it from July the 15th to the 19th. This after Zuma was mentioned in statements and testimonies of various witnesses. The commission says its lawyers have been in talks with Zuma’s lawyers since April the 30th to discuss giving him an opportunity to clear his name.
