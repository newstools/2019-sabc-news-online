CapeNature has introduced a new policy that will allow for the restricted consumptive use of species of wild flora for traditional, cultural and medicinal purposes. The policy has the backing of the Western Cape Environment Department. It will allow communities and traditional healers to harvest wild plants from the veld in CapeNature-managed protected areas. Department spokesperson James Brent-Styan says, “It’s a ground breaking new policy. It will allow for the restrictive and carefully managed harvesting of some species of wild flora in CapeNature managed protected areas. It will naturally require strict adherence to set restrictions and regulations and permits will be needed.” He adds: “At the end of the day, we believe that by taking hands together we will be able to manage to protect and utilise our heritage sites together.”
