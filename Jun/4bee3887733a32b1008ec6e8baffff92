Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, says the current school laws should be amended to deal with learners who have committed offences. He says the law is being changed to enable rehabilitation before allowing the learner back in the schooling system. This follows the killing of a learner at Forest High School, south of Johannesburg on Monday by another learner. Lesufi says the current law, which dictates that a learner simply be transferred to another school after committing an offence, will not solve the problem. “The current laws say that particular learner must be taken to another school. Education is a constitutional right but when you expel the learner, the onus is now on the department of the district to find another school. So we are now in the process of reviewing the SA Schools Act and our argument is very simple and strong, these learners must go to rehabilitation first. It is only when they perform and their report indicates they are in a good mind, it’s then you can take them to another school,” says Lesufi. Watch a related video below:
