The rand is unchanged against the greenback, with investors looking ahead to Wednesdayâ€™s release of local consumer price figures and the United States decision on interest rates. The US Federal Reserve two-day meeting is expected to lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year, which may heighten demand for emerging-market currencies. The rand is currently trading at R14.79 against the dollar.
