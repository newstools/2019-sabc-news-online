A nurse at the Motherwell Medical Centre in Port Elizabeth has been assaulted allegedly by a patient. She was attending to the man who came in with a stab wound. The man also allegedly assaulted two security guards. The Eastern Cape health department has condemned the incident and has laid a criminal charge against the patient. Department spokesperson, Sizwe Kupelo, says the police must take the case seriously. “People will understand that we provide a health service and there are policies that guide us. So there is no way that we can deploy security officials inside the wards because we are guided by the confidentiality policies. So what has happened yesterday does not suggest a security breach on our side. We have got adequate security in all our facilities but we are going to deal decisively with anyone who violates the safety of our medical staff,” says Kupelo.
