He says the President is accompanied by several ministers, including Naledi Pandor of the International Relations, Ibrahim Patel from the Trade and Industry Portfolio as well Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Treasury Director General, Dondo Mogajane says the South African delegation attending the summit which kicks off on Friday in Osaka, Japan, is expected to discuss issues that affect South Africa and address the country’s needs. He says matters relating to trade tensions, debt sustainability, inequality and investment will top the agenda at the conference. Mogajane says the South African delegation will use the Group-20 meeting to present South Africa’s investment case. “I think our story is pretty clear. We’ve got seven priorities that the President outlined in the State of the Nation last week. We are focused on insuring that we package them in a way that can attract investments that are critical, because we’ve got a lot to offer. In terms of being a strong base, if you remember our seven priorities is African region. So, we have to create an environment where global businesses come and set base in South Africa so that they can springboard into the rest of the continent.”
