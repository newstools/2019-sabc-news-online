Opposition parties in Gauteng have expressed mixed reactions to Premier David Makhura‘s Cabinet reshuffle. This comes days after appointing his 10-member Executive Council. Panyaza Lesufi, who was initially named Finance and e-Government MEC, has been returned to his previous Education Portfolio. Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko, who was supposed to succeed him as Education MEC, will now move to Finance and e-Government. While the Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the reshuffle, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Freedom Front Plus (FFPlus) are not pleased. FF Plus Caucus Leader in the Gauteng Legislature, Anton Alberts, says Lesufi has failed to build enough schools and has been unfairly targeting Afrikaans-medium schools. “It’s very shocking that Mr Lesufi has been placed in charge of Gauteng schools again. So, Mr Lesufi tried to ‘anglicise’ most schools, turning schools that had mother tongue instruction into an English school, which is quite bad for education. Mr Lesufi doesn’t use the funds given to him to build more infrastructures so that there are sufficient mother tongue schools around the whole of Gauteng. But, the FF+ will continue to oppose his race-based politics,” says Alberts. Watch a related video below:
