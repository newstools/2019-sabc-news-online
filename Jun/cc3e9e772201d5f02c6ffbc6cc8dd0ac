Rand Water says it is hopeful that it will be able to complete the maintenance work on its pipeline by Wednesday afternoon. The bulk water supplier says the work to install a valve on its pipeline is progressing as per schedule and on target. The maintenance work, which started on Monday, is scheduled to be completed on Wednesday. Rand Water spokesperson Eddy Singo has urged consumers to continue using water sparingly. “We have also been looking at our reservoir as well. Reservoirs are in good levels and we also know that we will be able to maintain the system beyond,” says Singo. Watch a related video below:
