Concerned African National Congress (ANC) members in QwaQwa in the eastern Free State want the party to deal swiftly in resolving a dispute of the 16 expelled councillors at the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality. The group was axed after they were found guilty of voting with the opposition in removing former mayor Vusi Tshabalala. The group’s leader, Mongezi Malaoane, says the party is yet to respond to their memorandum of grievances which they submitted two weeks ago. Malaoane says the matter has impacted negatively on service delivery. “On the 10th of June, we submitted our memorandum at Luthuli house. Since from that day to date we have not received any answer from the president. So we have decided that very soon we will go back and demand answers. We have been waiting for the president to give us answers about the issue of 16 councillors who have been expelled in our municipality. Very soon we will go and demand answers and up until we get answers we are not coming back,” says Malaoane. Meanwhile in KwaZulu-Natal, a group of ANC youth league members are demanding the disbandment of the league’s provincial executive committee, saying its term of office has expired. They marched to the ANC provincial offices in Durban. The marchers also accused both Youth League provincial Chairperson Kwazi Mshengu and provincial secretary, Thanduxolo Sabela of clinging to power.
