Gauteng Human Settlements MEC, Lebogang Maile, says he fully supports Mayor Herman Mashaba’s forensic investigation into the alleged misappropriation of the Alex Renewal Project budget. Maile addressed allegations that he looted over R1 billion allocated for the project. The MEC says the R1.3 billion was never a ring-fenced amount where anyone can be held accountable. He added that despite it’s shortcomings, the Alex Renewal Project did deliver a number of projects in the area, but still had a long way to go. “I am happy because mayor Mashaba has got a forensic investigation and I think we must put it on record that we support that investigation and we look forward to its outcome. If there is any basis and reason for us as a province to launch an investigation we will do that. We will never hesitate. Today we are not coming here to say no we can’t investigate, we are not here to defend anybody. Today we are here to say that narrative that is in the public is flawed. It’s not true, and that is why we are giving you the number. But if you say there is corruption then that is another story,” says Maile. Watch video below:
