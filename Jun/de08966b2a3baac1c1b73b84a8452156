Two videos of prisoners and warders engaged in illicit behaviour at Durban’s Westville Prison have emerged. The cell phone footage shows prisoners snorting what appears to be cocaine and smoking other drugs inside their jail cells. Warders are also seen handing weapons to prisoners and allegedly encouraging them to fight in the videos. Prison officials admitted there are corrupt officials within the system. KwaZulu-Natal Correctional Services Department spokesperson Thulani Mdluli says the Department is investigating the incidents. “Heads will roll, the incident has left us embarrassed and an investigation is underway to determine how the drugs made their way inside the prison.” In 2018, during a prison raid, scores of cell phones were confiscated; drugs including ecstasy and whoonga were found. Authorities also discovered various weapons. WATCH BELOW:
