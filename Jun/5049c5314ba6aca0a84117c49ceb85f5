President Cyril Ramaphosa has received the Public Protector’s notice on her probe into allegations that he lied to Parliament. The claims relate to the R500 000 Bosasa donation to support his campaign for the ANC presidency. The Democratic Alliance (DA) had threatened to take action against Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane if her report into the matter was not released by the end of this week. The Public Protector has granted the President until June 21 to respond to the preliminary report. Presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko has confirmed the developments. “The Presidency can confirm Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s confirmation that she has served a section 7.9 notice on him. President Ramaphosa has written for an extension of the 10-day period but also elected to exercise his entitlement to question the complainant, Mr Maimane, and several other witnesses that have appeared before the PP (Public Protector) during the course of the investigation. It’s important to reiterate that the President remains fully committed to cooperating with the PP in the course of the investigation.” President Ramaphosa initially told Members of Parliament (MPs) the half a million rand was a payment to his son for services he had rendered to the controversial company, implicated in dodgy deals with state entities. He later corrected his submission to the National Assembly, saying the donation was made towards his ANC campaign without his knowledge.
