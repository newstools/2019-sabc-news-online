Authorities now say the pride of 14 lions that has been spotted at the Foskor Mine in Phalaborwa will not be darted and moved from the premises. This is according to Limpopo Economic Development and Tourism MEC, Thabo Mokone who has visited the area. The pride made headlines when the department released a media statement saying the predators had been spotted in the area. It is said rangers had been able to locate and confine the lions to a safe area. Mokone says they have ensured that the lions – which he says have been living in the area for years – continue to live safely with humans. Meanwhile, some residents of Phalaborwa in Limpopo say they have been living in fear since reports of a pride of 14 lions being on the loose at the nearby Foskor Mine. The pride has been at Foskor’s premises for a few days. Some residents however say there are reports of the lions being spotted in town. “As Phalaborwa residents we live in fear. Even today I received a message that a lion was spotted at Tamboti Street and that another at the graveyard. They even sent me pictures. They must help us,” says a resident “We also fear for our children’s safety, especially when they go to the bus station in the morning for school. I always wonder if we will hear that they have been mauled. They must help us quickly,” adds another resident. WATCH BELOW:
