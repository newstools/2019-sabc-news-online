Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan says progress has been made in terms of unbundling Eskom as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa during the February State of the Nation Address (SONA). Gordhan was addressing the joint sitting of Parliament debating last week’s State of the Nation Address. He has added that the power utility has reached 94 days without load shedding and he wishes that the situation continues. “In terms of restructuring of Eskom, good progress has been made in relation to working out a road map to implement the proposals in the February 2019 SONA, to separate generation transmission and distribution functions into three separate business entities wholly owned by the state. There is no deviation from the strategic path,” says Gordhan.
