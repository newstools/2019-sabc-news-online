Black First Land First (BLF) leadership has rubbished its Secretary General Siphesihle Jele’s claims that its leader Andile Mgxitama is an illegitimate president. In a statement posted on the organisation’s Twitter account, Jele said that Mngxitama and Shanta Balashkrina are not genuine members of BLF until such time they provide proof of membership. Speaking to the SABC earlier, Mgxitama says “Our Secretary General has gone rogue, completely rogue, but for these reasons that he’s under stress. He did not achieve what he (needed) to achieve and we believe that he’s behaving erratically and firming in, if you like, the enemy, our enemy’s desire to say Black First Land First is divided. So, our SG thinks that in doing this he can somehow get a platform to get known maybe that could put him in a better position that all of us are,” says Jele. But with its SG facing a litany of charges and the public spats, it would seem party members are at loggerheads. But Mngxitama’s also denied claims of a split in the party. BLF’s deputy president Zanele Lwana says “The leadership of BLF is not divided. We are guided by the structure of the central committee and that national committee made up of all of our provincial leaders and all of us are confidence in the leadership of comrade Andile Mgxitama.” The party had a poor showing at the May polls, failing to secure a seat in Parliament.
