The Clothing and Textile Conference at the Cape Town International Convention Centre has been told about success stories of the US Africa Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA). The Act significantly enhances market access to the US for qualifying Sub-Saharan African countries. Executive Vice President of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, Steve Lamar has encouraged countries to use the opportunities provided by the act. He says Ethiopia is one of the countries that has benefited from AGOA . Lamar says, “One of the success stories that we point to in Africa over the last couple of years is when several brands recruited their partners from Asia primarily from China to come down to Ethiopia and set up both the productive capacity for the end items.’ “That’s an important story because what it reflects is that as more production was coming from Ethiopia one of the successful ingredients was that there was a lot of Chinese investment in Ethiopia,” he adds.
