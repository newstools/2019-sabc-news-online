Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi says his first priority for his second term is Early Childhood Development (ECD ). Lesufi says a team has been put together to restructure classrooms across all primay schools to prepare for new changes. He says the best educators will also be recruited for ECD purposes. The MEC has been addressing School Governing Bodies, principals and other stakeholders at Nasrec on his plans for the next five years. ” ECD will migrate from the Department of Social Development and come to the Department of Education. All our primary schools must prepare to have two important grades, Grade RR and Grade R. From now on we are starting those particular plans to ensure that Grade R is not a fund raising arm of our primary schools and SGBs,” says Lesufi.
