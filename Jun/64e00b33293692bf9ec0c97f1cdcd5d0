The Automobile Association (AA) is predicting that July brings with it good news for motorists. The AA expects that lower international oil prices have set up a substantial reduction in the fuel price. The price of petrol is expected to decrease by 86 cents a litre, diesel by 68 cents and illuminating paraffin by 58 cents. The AA says the prices could have decreased further if the rand fared better on the markets.
