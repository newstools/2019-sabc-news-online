Another learner has been stabbed at the Indwe Secondary School at Mossel Bay in the Southern Cape. The Education Department says the Grade 11 learner is in a stable condition after being stabbed by another learner in the lower back. On Monday, a 15-year-old learner was stabbed after a group of boys entered the school with weapons. Western Cape Education Ministry spokesperson, Jessica Shelver says,”The SAPS (South African Police Service)  have apprehended the perpetrator, a Grade 9 learner at the school.” “District officials visited the school following the incident and indications are that the on-going fights at the school are as a result of gang factions and issues that stem from the community. A meeting is scheduled for Thursday with parents, teachers, community organisations and SAPS with the aim of joining forces to find a solution to the scourge of gangsterism that is plaguing the school and the community, ” Shelver adds.
