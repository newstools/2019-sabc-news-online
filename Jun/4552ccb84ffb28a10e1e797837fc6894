The precise reasons why a newborn child was kidnapped from Chris Hani Baragwanath remains a mystery. The Health Department is to review the hospital’s security. A woman has since been arrested and police say more arrests are imminent. A police tip-off led to the arrest of the woman. She’s believed to have snatched the infant from the antenatal ward. She’s understood to have gained access to the maternity wing during visiting hours posing as a relative. She stole the baby and fled. Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku says nurses and security will be called to account for the kidnapping. “The baby was later found unharmed at a house in Diepkloof. Nurses and security will be called to account for this dangerous lapse in security. They will be held accountable. But there was a serious problem of, in the midst of the madness, that we have in the hospital when the visiting hours happen. That normally can happen. You know, it’s a mistake. It has never happened in maybe more than 30 years, but it just seems that this (was) well-orchestrated and well-planned. It’s like wanting me to explain how did the volcano, or the natural disaster happen. They do happen and we are going to learn from it.” The female suspect will appear on Monday in the Protea Magistrate’s Court. Police Spokesperson, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini says that they do not believe that the suspect was alone in the kidnapping. “We have detained the suspect after we were informed about the whereabouts of the baby. At this stage, we are questioning the suspect because we believe she was not alone in this offence. Once she has been charged, she will appear at the Protea Magistrate’s Court.” The mother of the newborn is receiving counselling. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
