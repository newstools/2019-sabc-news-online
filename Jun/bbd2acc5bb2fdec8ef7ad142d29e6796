Former real estate agent and convicted racist Vicki Momberg has told the High Court in Johannesburg that journalists have no respect for her and have endangered her life. The court had to be adjourned earlier on Tuesday morning following Mombergâ€™s outburst as she stormed out of court, calling for journalists to be kicked out.  She alleges that some have published her address and cell phone number, saying this will put her entire family in danger. Momberg is appealing her conviction and three-year sentence. She was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year suspended, in March last year after she was captured on video shouting racial slurs at police officers while they were assisting her after she was involved in a smash-and-grab incident in February 2016. She has told the judge that she would like to represent herself. Lawyers involved in the case have said that they will no longer represent her as she is unhappy with their services.
