Gauteng MEC for Human Settlement, Lebogang Maile is assessing the situation in Marlboro, near Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, where 80 illegal structures were demolished on Friday. Maile has promised residents affected by the demolition of their homes that they would be assisted. He says the manner in which the operation was conducted is unacceptable. Maile also called on the City of Johannesburg to provide permanent accommodation for the affected residents. “We have already instructed our team in the department of Corporate Governance Unit responsible for disaster management to come and put interim measures in place. And at the same time, we want to call upon the municipality to take full responsibility. It is their responsibility; they must arrange permanent accommodation for our people here. We will work with them but also will play our part and do our level best in making sure we resolve not just this issue but many others that are there.”  Chaos broke out when the Red Ants executed a court order to break down the houses. The court order was issued months ago. Residents then went on the rampage, torching three houses in the neighbouring Alexandra. Some residents are still salvaging what is left after the operation. The structures were demolished with bulldozers. Earlier on Saturday, police had to fire rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. A heavy police contingent has been deployed to keep the situation under control.
