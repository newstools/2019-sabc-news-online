Rand Water says it has not received any water supply interruption notices as a result of its continued work to install a valve on its pipeline. The water utility says the work is progressing according to schedule. The water shutdown which started on Monday is scheduled to last for 54 hours. Rand Water spokesperson Eddy Singo says,“We are now on the most critical part which is the cutting, welding, and installation of the valve. Early this morning (Wednesday), when we went on site, our technicians are really working on that, and we are hoping that by tomorrow (Thursday) as we had indicated that by tomorrow (Thursday) at 12:30 – we should be able to commission the plant back to normal without hindrances.”
