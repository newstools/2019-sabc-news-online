The 14 political parties represented in Parliament will on Tuesday debate the State of the Nation Address (SONA). Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa officially opened the sixth Parliament when he addressed the joint sitting of the two Houses. Most opposition parties expressed disappointment with his speech, accusing him of presenting a dream without concrete plans, while the African National Congress (ANC) said ministers would provide the details. Ramaphosa will reply to the debate on Wednesday. Watch a related video below:
