Provincial Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says the death toll on Western Cape roads has risen to seven since the start of the weekend. The most recent fatal crash was of a 36-year-old man who was knocked down by a vehicle at Lwandle near the Strand. Africa says four of those killed in accidents in Cape Town were pedestrians. Meanwhile, thirty five people were arrested for drunk driving so far this weekend in Cape Town. Africa said officers nabbed two speedsters in separate incidents in Mossel Bay and Beaufort West in the Karoo. He said those arrested were for offences including reckless and negligent driving, selling liquor without a licence and the illegal possession of drugs.
