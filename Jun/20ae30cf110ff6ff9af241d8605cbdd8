The African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee in the Northern Cape says they are going to find ways to address the challenges of unemployment, inequality and poverty. These are some of the resolutions taken at their Lekgotla held in Kimberley. Although ANC Chairperson Dr Zamani Saul has introduced changes that have brought hope to many in the province, some unemployed youth fail to see how these efforts could change their circumstances. “It is very depressing because people idle and they resort to other vile measures and it is not constructive anymore.” Another young person says, “How is this, us being skilled translate into jobs, because it doesn’t to me. And we are not saying that the government is not trying, but the current inventions are not working.”
