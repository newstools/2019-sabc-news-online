All 11 employees who were hospitalised after a fire broke out at one of the South African Broadcasting Corporation’s (SABC) canteens in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, have been discharged from hospital. Staff at the SABC’s Radio Park building had to be evacuated after the fire started in a secluded area of the canteen. Earlier this year, the same building had to be evacuated following a diesel spillage on the 15th floor. “As the SABC, we are very grateful and thankful that they are fine. Everything is back to normal as from yesterday (Tuesday). Staff is back in the building.  The canteen area has just been closed off. The incident happened in a secluded part of the canteen, as I have heard reports that the canteen burnt down which is not true,” says Vuyo Mthembu. Watch a related video below:
