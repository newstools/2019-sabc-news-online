Colleagues of well known Labour Court Judge, Anton Steenkamp, will remember him for the brilliant judgments he wrote. The legal fratenity on Monday  held a memorial service for the late judge at the Labour Court in Cape Town. He died recently, after he was bitten by a Black Mamba while on safari in Zambia. Speaker after speaker commended him for his expertise in writing his judgments especially in his mother tongue. Steenkamp joined the Labour Court in 2010 and his colleagues say he served the court diligently and that he was firm but fair. His colleagues say his untimely death is a loss to the profession. “Judge Steenkamp is remembered for his firm but fair dealings with the law and representatives, his quick assessment of the essential elements of the case, his independence of thought and quick delivery of well written and well reasoned judgments. Sadly he was not destined to serve on the bench as long as he otherwise would have and the court has been deprived of the valuable contribution he would have continued to make,” says Judge President of the Labour Court, Basheer Waglay.
