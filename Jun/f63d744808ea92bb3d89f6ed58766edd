The bail hearing of the 19-year-old, who allegedly stabbed to death a  fellow pupil at a Johannesburg school during a gang-related altercation, has been set down for Thursday. The Forest Hill teenager is charged with one case of murder and two of attempted murder.  The day of dramatic scenes at the court, included an appearance by yet another alleged teen killer as well as a scuffle between rival gang members. Police were kept busy as these rival gang members arrived at the same time to support their members. The grade 11 Forest High school learner made his first appearance. The state says it will not be opposing bail nor will it pursue a premeditated murder charge against the suspect. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Gauteng Spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane, says that the information they currently have does not suggest that the murder was premeditated. “The information at our disposal currently doesn’t suggest that the murder was planned; hence he was charged with murder in terms of Section 51(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act instead of premeditated murder which is Section 51(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The investigations are on-going and so far we don’t have information that that suggest that the boy is a flight risk or a danger to society.” Also making an appearance in the same courtroom, a 15-year-old boy accused of murdering Mondeor High school learner, Khulani Mathebula.
