The African National Congress (ANC) plans to lay criminal charges against singer Steve Hofmeyr on Thursday. Hofmeyr went on a rant on Twitter in response to South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela’s alleged tirade about land. Hofmeyr tagged Democratic Alliance (DA) Member of Parliament, Phumzile van Damme, who had tweeted about an alleged racist incident that occurred at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. Hofmeyr said that as a taxpayer, he was their boss and if they took land, they would die. Van Damme says she too plans to lay charges. “Well, we can no longer take matters such as this lightly. It has got to do with damaging the dignity of others, but also putting the lives of others under threat. We can’t make jokes about murder, we can’t take racial statements lightly because of the kind of a country that we are and where we come from,” says ANC National spokesperson Pule Mabe.
