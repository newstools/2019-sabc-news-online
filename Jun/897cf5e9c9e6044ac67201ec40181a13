The Democratic Alliance (DA) has blamed the Free State Department of Public Works for its failure to pay municipal accounts for rates and taxes. The party says the reason why some municipalities have collapsed can be attributed to the department constantly failing to settle their debts. DA member of provincial legislature Leona Kleynhans says the situation has gotten worse for municipalities and it is feared that workers might not be paid their salaries. “We saw, in this week, at least three municipalities are able to pay workers salaries. Of course now this is on top of the problem in the municipalities of revenue collection. They are unable to collect what people pay and of course this debt from the department of Public Works makes the situation even worse,” says Kleynhans.
