Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu says dysfunctional municipalities will top the next cabinet meeting. On Wednesday, the Auditor General said only 18 of the 257 municipalities received clean audits. R25 billion was lost as a result of irregular expenditure. Local government elections are in just two years’ time. Cabinet has set up an Inter-ministerial Committee chaired by Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The committee will manage logistics and administrative preparations for the municipal poll in 2021. The Auditor General’s report showed various local government role players have been slow in implementing previous recommendations. A mere 18 municipalities out of 257 had obtained clean audits. Mthembu says this is evidenced by poor service delivery and protests. Mthembu also raised concerns that Makwetu’s auditors had received death threats and other acts of intimidation. Cabinet has also called on social partners to work together to accelerate growth and make South Africa a better country for all. This week’s cabinet meeting was called to discuss the implementation of some of the commitments in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address which he presented in Parliament last week.
