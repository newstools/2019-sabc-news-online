The Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa) has assured their employees that they will be paid their salaries by Friday latest. This after it was reported that Prasa had joined a list of State-Owned Entities struggling to pay their workers on time. It follows arms manufacturer, Denel’s announcement earlier this week that only 85% of their workers’ salaries will be paid in June. However, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says the rest of Denel’s workers’ salaries will be paid by Friday. Prasa Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Nkosinathi Sishi, has attributed the late payment to a glitch in their payroll system. “I wish to assure our employees, particularly those affected in the corporate as well as Metrorail, that their salaries will be delayed with the maximum of 24 hours but they will be paid by the 28th. It’s not a bank problem, it is an error within our own financial unit that is responsible. At the time they were effecting the changes as a result of the increase in salaries after the salary negotiations, they made an error of placing the transfer for the 28th when it was supposed to be the 27th. We are investigating this and within 48 hours we will have a report to deal with the issues,” says Sishi. Watch Denel CEO commenting on their salary issues below:
