Corruption Watch and Right2Know will bring an application in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday to review and set aside the findings of the Arms Procurement Commission under the leadership of Judge Willie Seriti. The organisations claim the Commission failed miserably to conduct the most routine of investigations to arrive at the conclusion that there was no evidence of corruption in the arms deal. They say the application will show how the Commission misled the public, ignored evidence of corruption and failed to investigate serious corruption allegations put before it. The Seriti Commission sat in Pretoria from August 2012 to June 2015 and heard evidence from 54 people, including former president, Thabo Mbeki. He was chair of the Cabinet committee which approved the R30 billion defence equipment acquisition.  Watch related video below:
