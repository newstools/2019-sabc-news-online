City Power CEO Lerato Setshedi has ordered the city of Johannesburg to investigate the awarding of a close to R1  billion tender at the power utility. Setshedi has requested the City of Johannesburg’s special investigation unit head General Shadrack Sibiya to investigate how the tender process was handled. The High Court in Johannesburg declared the tender invalid and set it aside. The court ordered that all companies involved should re-submit the tender for evaluation. City Power Spokesperson Isaac Mangena says they have asked the city to step in because they do not have the necessary skills or resources to do a proper investigation. “We cannot investigate a situation where our own officials are suspected of possible wrongdoing and also because City Power does not have the necessary skills and resources to do a proper investigation,” says Mangena.
