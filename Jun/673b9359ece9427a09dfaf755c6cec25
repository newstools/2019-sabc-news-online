Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile said the City of Johannesburg should be held responsible for the evictions and demolitions in Alexandra townships, north of Johannesburg. Maile, who visited the area on Saturday, said the manner in which the operation was conducted is unacceptable and called on the City of Johannesburg to provide permanent accommodation for the affected residents. Residents say the Red Ants arrived and told them to remove their belongings without giving them an eviction notice. Maile promised residents affected by the demolitions that they would be assisted. He said: “We have already instructed our team in the Department of Corporate Governance Unit responsible for disaster management to come and put interim measures in place and at the same time we want to call on the municipality to take full responsibility, it is their responsibility…” “We will work with them [City of Johannesburg], but also will play our part and do our level best in making sure we resolve not just this issue but many others that are there,” added Maile. Residents went on a rampage over the weekend after 80 homes were demolished by the Red Ants who were executing a court order for the demolition of the houses that was issued months ago.
