The trial of four men accused of the murder of North West businessman, Wandile Bozwana is expected to resume in the High Court in Pretoria on Monday morning. The case against Sipho Hudla, Matamela Mutapa, Vusi Mathibela and Bonginkosi Khumalo, was postponed in 2018 while the state was awaiting the authentication of the evidence on a video. Bozwana died in hospital after he and his business partner Mpho Baloyi were shot at in Pretoria, in October 2015. Baloyi was behind the wheel when the shooting took place at the Garsfontein offramp from the N1 freeway. Bozwana was hit by around nine bullets, while Baloyi sustained two gunshot wounds. The four men accused of the murder and attempted murder have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
