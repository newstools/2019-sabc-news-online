The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Wednesday continue to hear testimony from former South African Airways (SAA) CFO Phumeza Nhantsi. It will also hear evidence from Director of BNP capital Daniel Mahlangu, who’s alleged to have had a close friendship with the son of SAA chair Dudu Myeni. On Tuesday, the commission heard how Nhantsi faced mounting pressure from Myeni and her personal advisor to get the BNP cancelation fee approved. Nhantsi says she became scared because she was being bullied and threatened. She says that at one point Myeni bragged to Nhantsi how nothing can be pinned against her cause she doesn’t write anything down nor sign anything. Nhantsi told the commission she believes Myeni was one of the people that stood to benefit from the profits of the cancellation fee as she did not want other Board members to know about it.” Click on the video below:
