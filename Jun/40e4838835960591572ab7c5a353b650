Former mine workers of the Lily mine near Barberton in Mpumalanga have decided to go underground to search for the container that was buried underground with three of their colleagues in 2016. The remains of the three employees, Solomon Nyarenda, Pretty Nkambule and Yvonne Mnisiâ€™s were never recovered. Former mine workers spokesperson Harry Mazibuko says they have decided to go underground to search for the container because mine management and government have failed to find it. Business rescue practitioner at Lily mine, Rob Devereaux last year said that R300-million has been secured to resume searching operations for the container this year. Click on video below:
