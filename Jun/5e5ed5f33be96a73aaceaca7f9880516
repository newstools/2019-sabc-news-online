South African Airways has introduced a new state of the art aircraft that will service New York. The ultra-long haul aircraft will travel non-stop between Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo and John F. Kennedy international airports. The airline will lease the aircraft for three years. “The impact of this decision will manifest in at least two significant ways. It will result in improved operating cost and boost route profitability prospects on the Johannesburg-New York route. It will bring about an enhanced customer travel experience for our passengers and this will include features of a modern cabin in both the business and economic class,” says SAA Spokesperson, Tlali Tlali.
