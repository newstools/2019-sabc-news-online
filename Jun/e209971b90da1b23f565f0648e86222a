The Victim Support Unit at the University of Cape Town says the sentencing of Constantia businessman Rob Packham should serve as a deterrent to gender-based violence. The Cape Town High Court sentenced Packham to 22 years in jail on Wednesday for killing his wife, Gill, in February 2018. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has also welcomed the jail term. “As the NPA we are satisfied with the sentence as it is the balanced sentence between the horrific crime that was committed and the rights of the victim of the crime.  We believe that justice has been done.” Judge Elize Steyn cited Packham’s lack of remorse as one of the reasons the court decided to increase the minimum sentence of 15 years for murder.
