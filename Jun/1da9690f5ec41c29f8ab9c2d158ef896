Ten miners have been admitted to hospital after they collapsed underground at the Lanxess Chrome Mine near Rustenburg, in North West. The miners who have been protesting for six days are against a number of issues including the re-instatement of their colleagues and the suspension of an alleged sex pest. In a press briefing in Johannesburg, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) Secretary General Irvin Jim says the situation has developed into a crisis. “People, in terms of these workers, their lives are at risk. Everyday that goes by under the mine, you are risking your life, but workers are saying enough is enough. We cannot continue to work under these conditions,” says Jim. Jim also says they’re not sure how long they can survive. “We don’t want to speculate; that is why we are doing everything we can from here. I’m calling for DMR to intervene to resuscitate negotiations,” explains Jim. Watch related video below for more on the story:
