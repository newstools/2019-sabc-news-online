Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says classes have been suspended at  Forest High School in Turffontein, Johannesburg, after a grade 10 learner was stabbed to death. The learner was attacked – allegedly by two grade eight learners outside the school. Lesufi has visited the school where he tried to console the distraught family of the victim. “From the side of education unfortunately we can’t allow education to proceed so we have suspended classes immediately. We’ve asked the principal to communicate with the parents. We’ve quarantined the school for the next 48 hours and allow the police and our psycho-social workers to provide that kind of assistance.” Police have confirmed that a case of murder and two of attempted murder have been opened after the stabbing at Forest High School. It is alleged that a scuffle broke out, leading to the death of the teenager. Police spokesperson, Mavela Masondo explains: “We can confirm that there is a learner that was stabbed and killed here at Forest Hill. It is alleged that there was a fight between two groups and the one learner was stabbed and killed and the other two learners were stabbed and taken to hospital in a stable condition. As the police we’ve started with our investigation. No one has been arrested yet but we are obtaining statements from the people that were around when this thing happened.” Pathologists have collected the body of the learner who was stabbed.
