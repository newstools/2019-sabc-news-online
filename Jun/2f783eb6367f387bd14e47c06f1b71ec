The outgoing City of Tshwane’s Member of the Mayoral Committee for Housing and Human Settlement Mandla Nkomo says the aim of giving out title deeds is to ensure that the lives of the beneficiaries improve. A grandmother who is 111-years-old from Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, is one of the latest beneficiaries of the City of Tshwane’s title deeds. Gogo Tsatsawani Makanete has been living in the area since 1967, and on Saturday she was given confirmation of the ownership of her house. Speaking to SABC News, Makanete’s daughter-in-law, Annah, says the family is grateful. ” I am happy if Magogo has a house and then already it’s fine,” says Makanete. Nkomo says those who have received title deeds from the City of Tshwane administration now have full ownership of the land. “When you have a title deed it shows that you are the legal owner of a particular property, which means that you can be able to sell the property if you want. You can even upgrade the property. You can even go to the banks and apply for a loan so that you can be able to pay school for your kids. So it gives you the power of ownership of land. That’s how we encourage the people and to follow the processes by not invading, by going through a correct system. So that they can be given legal documents that will ensure that they are constitutional owners of that land.” The City of Tshwane has prioritised distribution of title deeds. In 2018, former Mayor Solly Msimanga announced that they had set out a target of issuing 6 000 title deeds in various parts of the city.
