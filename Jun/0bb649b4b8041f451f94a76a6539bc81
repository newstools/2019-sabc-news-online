The Communications Workers Union (CWU) says it will be meeting with MultiChoice on Wednesday on the announced retrenchment of more than 2 000 workers. The broadcaster announced that it would be retrenching workers to keep up with economic and technological developments. Most of those who could be retrenched work at call centres and customer care facilities. CWU’s Secretary General Aubrey Tshabalala says they want to make sure everything has been done to save jobs. “Management of MultiChoice invited us into a Section 189 meeting which is guided by law in terms of retrenchments, and they have simultaneously spoken to workers about their intention to retrench, the number there is over 2000. We have then requested an urgent intervention meeting with the CEO and his executive team.”
