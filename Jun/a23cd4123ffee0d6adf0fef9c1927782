There were tough talk on corruption and complacency by public officials as the Gauteng ANC caucus in the legislature concluded its lekgotla in Tshwane, on Saturday. The caucus adopted a programme of action to accelerate service delivery and implement the party’s manifesto commitments. With declining support in the highly-contested Gauteng province in the recent elections, the governing party caucus in the legislature is cracking the whip on its public representatives. It says time for non-performance is over. Gauteng ANC Chief Whip, Mzi Khumalo, says that they have heard the people. “We are confident that we have heard what people of Gauteng are saying to us. We are saying time for rhetoric is over. Everything should be action driven.” Khumalo says the organisation has made a commitment to hold public officials accountable and to fight corruption head on. “We have committed ourselves that corruption must not have any space. Whoever is involved, we will be dealing with those people we are serious about that.” The caucus says it’s still determined at a move to scrap the controversial e-tolling system. Khumalo says they will be working closely with the premier to deal the issue of e-tolls. “We tool a resolution that we don’t want e-tolls we will be looking closely on how the premier and his government are dealing with this.” Gauteng Premier, David Makhura is expected to highlight some of government’s priorities when he presents the state of the province address on Monday.
