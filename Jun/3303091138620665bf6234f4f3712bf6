The African National Congress’ (ANC) head of presidency, Zizi Kodwa, says he believes that ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule’s Twitter feed was hacked. Magashule’s office claims his account was allegedly used to send out a tweet opposing a statement issued by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday on the Reserve Bank saga. Ramaphosa says the recent public spats on the Reserve Bank’s mandate have undermined the confidence of citizens and investors and were unhelpful. This follows a week of public infighting among ANC members, after Magashule said the governing party wants the mandate of the bank to be expanded to focus on development and job creation. Magashule’s comments were subsequently contradicted by NEC members, Enoch Godongwana and Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni. Kodwa explains why he believes Magashule’s Twitter feed was hacked: “I believe I was the first to call to hunt down his office but I was not able to get hold of him, but people in his office assured. That is why they issued a rebuttal on the safety. I believe because he can’t do that immediately after the President issued a statement. Those who have a responsibility understand the reaction of the market, the impact of the reaction of the market in terms of what we say and how we say it as the leadership in public, they will understand there are certain things that won’t happen as soon as tomorrow. It will take time and we must create conducive conditions for the implementation of those resolutions,” says Kodwa. Watch a related video below:
