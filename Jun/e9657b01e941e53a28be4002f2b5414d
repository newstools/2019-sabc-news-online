United States (US) President Donald Trump says a deal struck to avert tariffs on Mexico will work if America’s Southern neighbour plays its part in cracking down on migration across the border. Trump tweeted that ‘Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, it will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!’   Mexico has agreed to expand its policy of taking back migrants while the United States processes their asylum claims. It also managed to avoid a proposal it had continually rejected that it process asylum claims on its own soil before migrants try to reach the United States.
