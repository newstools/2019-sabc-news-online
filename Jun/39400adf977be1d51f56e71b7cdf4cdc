The inquiry into the soci-economic conditions in Alexandra has reconvened in Johannesburg. On Monday, the inquiry heard testimony from the Gauteng Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector set up the inquiry earlier in 2019 following violent protests in Alexandra township over service delivery backlogs and the mushrooming of shacks. Two Chapter 9 institutions have been probing what’s hampering service delivery in Alexandra.
