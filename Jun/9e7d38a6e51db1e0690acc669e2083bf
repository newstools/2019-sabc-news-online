The University of the Free State’s (UFS) School of Clinical Medicine has suspended the training of its students at the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein over safety concerns. This follows two separate attacks in just five days. Earlier this week, a 24-year-old intern survived a rape attempt after she fought and bit off the tongue of her attacker. A female doctor was also robbed of her cellphone by three assailants in the hospital’s parking lot. University spokesperson Lacea Loader says the safety of their students is of paramount importance.
