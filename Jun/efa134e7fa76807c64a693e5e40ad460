A source inside the African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says the party’s provincial executive committee meeting that started on Friday has asked eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to take leave of absence. She was earlier granted R50 000 bail by the Durban commercial crimes court. Gumede who is also the ANC chairperson in eThekwini region along with some senior officials from eThekwini metro are alleged to have defrauded the municipality of millions of rands in a waste removal tender. The party’s provincial leadership meeting is also said to have taken a decision to disband the eThekwini Regional Executive committee and to appoint a Regional Task Team that will prepare for the regional conference.
