The State Capture Inquiry into allegations of corruption has heard of how EML Energy failed to honour its jet fuel supply agreement with SAA. That’s according to evidence given by SAA head of Fuel Management, Mark Vaughan, who testified on Tuesday. The commission also heard evidence relating to irregularities involving EML in another jet fuel supply agreement with SA Express. Vaughan testified that EML only supplied the airline with fuel for two weeks instead of a year. He said while the contract is due to end in July, EML has not delivered since the first month of the contract. EML’s appointment followed a 2016 board resolution to push for transformation in the procurement of jet fuel. The decision to procure from smaller player and not major oil producers meant that SAA would pay more for fuel. SA Express also awarded EML Energy a jet fuel supply contract at the Pilanesburg Airport in the North West. The airlines Airport Coordinator, Estelle Loock, testified that EML’s quotation did not align with SA Expresses calculations. EML quoted the airline for over R800 million litres per annum when it was mandated to provide less. The commission confirmed in a statement that it had received communication former President Jacob Zuma’s lawyer. In the letter, the former head of state confirmed his appearance before the commission in July. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
