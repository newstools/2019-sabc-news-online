The African National Congress (ANC) has opened a case of incitement of violence against Afrikaans artist Steve Hofmeyr at the Johannesburg Central Police Station. Speaking to the media outside the police station, ANC national spokesperson, Pule Mabe said that no one has a right to threaten anyone’s life. “We know that there could’ve been others that were unhappy by the statement that was made by our Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela- Hlongwane, even with that no one has got a right to say that they are going to kill others. It doesn’t matter whether you are white or black, they don’t have that right.” Hofmeyr’s outburst follows Mandela-Hlongwane’s controversial tweets on the land issue.
