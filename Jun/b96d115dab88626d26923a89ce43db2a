At least 30 shacks have been engulfed in a fire in Zandspruit, north of Johannesburg. Emergency Services’ Robert Mulaudzi says an investigation into the cause of the fire is underway. No injuries have been reported and Mulaudzi has urged residents to be careful when using heating devices. “About 30 shacks were destroyed in the incident, including a vehicle and a spaza shop. There were no injuries that were reported. We just want to urge all our residents, especially in our informal settlements to look after their heating and lighting devices, which may cause fire incidents so that we can avoid fire incidents like this one.”
