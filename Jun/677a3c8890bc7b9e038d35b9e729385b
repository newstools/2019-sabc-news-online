The City of Cape Town has warned that a cold front which will be rolling into the Mother City  on Friday, bringing with it heavy downpours, may cause localised flooding in some low lying informal settlements in the metro. Gale force winds of up to 85 kilometres per hour have also been forecasted. The City’s Disaster Risk Management spokesperson, Charlotte Powell, says they will be on high alert to deal with any damage caused by the extreme weather conditions. “The SA Weather Service forecasts winds of between 65 and 80km/h from tomorrow afternoon, with a potential of winds reaching 85km/h, easing off tomorrow night. These strong to gale force winds may result in coastal and other infrastructure damage. While the forecast is for light to moderate rainfall over the Cape metropole, there may be periods of heavy downpours in a short period of time, which may lead to localized flooding – especially in informal settlements.”
