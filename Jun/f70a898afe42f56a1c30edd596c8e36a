The case against Flaming Silver, a subsidiary of SSC Group, and Vantage Goldfields has been postponed to July. A fifth respondent in the matter, former Flaming Silver director Ferdi Dippenaar, wants to make further submissions, but SSC believes it’s just another delay tactics by both Vantage Golfields and Dippenaar. The SSC Group took Vantage Goldfields to court in an effort to force them to hand over the share certificate. Vantage Goldfields says SSC failed to pay and they cancelled the sale agreement. The SSC Group is not pleased. Director of Flaming Silver: SSC Group, Kenneth Mudziri says the delay is unfortunate for the company and the community. “They did not summit all the papers and we had submitted all our papers. This is a delaying tactics and it’s really unfortunate not only for the company, but the community at large. You can see the number of people that are here and waiting to hear good news. All we are saying to Vantage Goldfield is to honour the contract that was signed on the 31 October 2018. We said we have met all the conditions and they need to give us the share certificate.” Former miner, Ndumizo Mbanze has expressed disappointment. “It’s been over three years now. I mean you can see Vantage is playing tactics. You can see they don’t have hearts. You can see the matter need to be hear urgently so.” Vantage Goldfields says it’s also disappointed with the delay. The company claim to have a new investor.
