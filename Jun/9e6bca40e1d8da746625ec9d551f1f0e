The national leadership of the Young Communist League (YCL) has criticised the quality of education in South Africa, saying it is not sufficiently preparing young people to deal with the country’s economic challenges. This emerged during the league’s rally in Orkney in the North West. Young Communist League national secretary, Tinyiko Ntini… “Free education needs to go beyond financial barriers but speaks to the issues of the national autonomy, and deal again with the issues of the curriculum content, which so far is not responding to the economic needs that our society or our communities need. The curriculum content fails to respond directly to what the communities are faced with. Like where we are today, it’s a mining industrial place, but it’s rare to get courses that respond to mining and engineering.”
