South African Express Commercial General Manager, Arson Phiri, will testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown in Johannesburg on Thursday morning. The Commission is also expected to hear aviation-related testimony from North West Community Safety and Transport Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Kutlwano Phatudi and Koroneka Trading and Projects Director Babadi Tlatsana. On Wednesday, divisional and security manager at South African Express, Timothy Ngwenya, testified about alleged corruption between the airline and the North West Transport Department. He shed light on an arrangement entered into between SA Express by the North West Transport Department to fly routes to Pilanesberg and Mafikeng airports. The agreement was envisaged to move R400 million out of the North West government into SA Express and a third party that SA Express nominated to conduct ground-handling services at those airports named Koroneka. R97 million of that amount was paid out of the North West government and siphoned off through a “detailed scheme of money laundering”. Watch a related video below:
