African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule has accused the media of attempting to divide the party in its reporting. Magashule criticised the manner in which the media reported on the nomination of a number former ministers accused of corruption to head portfolio committees in Parliament. These include Bongani Bongo, Mosebenzi Zwane and Faith Muthambi. “Hogwash, because the top 6 officials as well as the alliance engaged in robust discussions and we arrived at those names and we don’t see any faction here, we see the leadership of the ANC elected at the conference and we rally behind the elected leadership of the ANC,” bemoaned Magashule. He further added, “It is only the media who are trying to divide the ANC. As the leadership we believe that we are united and we are united behind the president.”
