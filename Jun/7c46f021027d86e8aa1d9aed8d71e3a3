Former Head of Financial Risk Management at South African Airways (SAA), Cynthia Soraya Stimpel will testify at the Commission of inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday. Last year, former public enterprise minister Barbara Hogan told the Commission she was pressured by the Guptas to drop the SAA route to Mumbai so that it could be awarded to India’s Jet airways. She told the commission she was surprised because the route was profitable. Stimpel is likely to shed more light into how SAA lost the profitable route, and how the Guptas played a role in influencing that decision. Former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Mxolisi Nxasana, testified on Wednesday. Nxasana said he was forced out of his job in 2015 and his departure was as a result of the intention by former President Jacob Zuma to fire him. He also told the Commission he had recordings of former head of NPA Nomgcobo Jiba running a campaign to dig-up dirt on him to get him removed from office. Jiba’s lawyer expressed concern about evidence being heard at the Commission that she had not seen and that implicates her and that was not in the public domain. Click below to watch related video:
