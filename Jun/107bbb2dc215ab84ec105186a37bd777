The MyCiti N2 Express Service for commuters from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha in Cape Town remains suspended and this has left thousands of commuters stranded. The City of Cape Town suspended the service this weekend after the contract with the vehicle operating company, which manages the line, expired. The N2 Express Service is one of the busiest MyCiti bus routes. Suspended services have forced commuters to seek alternative transport. Late on Monday morning, some commuters arrived to a non-operational line; leaving many shocked and concerned, claiming they were not informed. ‘As a new member in MyCiti, I am really disappointed. I use MyCiti bus all the time so now I have paid my monthly ticket and now I must use another alternative transport. It’s causing me so much inconvenience now because right now you planned for the month that you are going to be using this MyCiti bus, so now having to take out extra out of your pocket; are they going to reimburse me? What’s going to happen now going forward, are my points going to expire?” The City of Cape Town has apologised to frustrated commuters, but has made contingency plans. Member of Mayoral Committee for Transport, Felicity Purchase, says that the Golden Arrow bus company has put additional buses on the route. ”Golden Arrow has come to the party and have put additional buses on the route for the additional passengers; even though there are illegal taxis on the road, but at the moment Golden Arrow is carrying the extra, and the taxi service.” The city is hopeful that an agreement will be reached with the joint venture operations company. Efforts to get comment from the operations company have been unsuccessful at this stage.
