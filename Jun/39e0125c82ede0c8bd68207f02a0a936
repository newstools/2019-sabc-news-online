Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi has broken his silence following criticism by his predecessor and former President Ian Khama. Khama, who has since left the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), accused Masisi of being autocratic, intolerant and of threatening the country as a beacon of stability in Africa. Addressing the media shortly after returning from his trip from the United States on Saturday night, President Masisi has called on “people” to give him the space to do his job. Masisi has also taken a swipe at animal rights groups who accuse his country of “exterminating” elephants. He says Botswana has done more for elephants than the rest of the world. “We have never at any time suggested we wanted to exterminate elephants and its quite ironic because it is we who are one of the driest countries in Southern Africa who have homed the largest elephant population in the world.” Related video click below:
