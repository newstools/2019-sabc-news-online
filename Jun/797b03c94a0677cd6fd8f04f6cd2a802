The State is opposing bail in the murder case of alleged Westbury gang boss, Leroy Brown and his co-accused, Christopher Charles.  Brown, more commonly known as “Finch” is believed to be the leader of the Varados gang. He and alleged accomplice Charles are making their formal bail application in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. Both Brown and Charles were arrested separately last month in connection with the 2016 killing of Westbury resident Reagan Jacobs. The two are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The investigating officer told the court that the two accused are members of a notorious gang, and it would not be in the interest of justice for the court to grant them bail.  The detective told the court that the accused are known to the witnesses. Two of the witnesses were injured on that fateful day in 2016 when Reagan Jacobs was murdered, allegedly by the accused. It also emerged that the two accused were previously convicted for various offences. The bail hearing continues.
