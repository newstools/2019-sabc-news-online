The KwaZulu-Natal Correctional Services Department says it is investigating alleged illicit behaviour at Durban’s Westville prison – after two videos emerged, showing what is believed to be drug use at the facility. The cell-phone footage shows prisoners snorting what appears to be cocaine and smoking other drugs inside their jail cells. Warders are also seen handing weapons to prisoners and allegedly encouraging them to fight. KZN Correctional Services Spokesperson, Thulani Mdluli, says those implicated will face the might of the law. “The matter was already in our hands and it is under a critical investigation at the moment. All those who may be found to be implicated in that video will definitely face the hand of the law, because what is being portrayed in that video is related to criminal activity.” Click on video below:
