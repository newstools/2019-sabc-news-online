Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, says the province will boost the capacity of its integrity management unit. He was speaking to the media during the induction of the province’s newly-appointed MECs in Sandton, Johannesburg on Thursday. Makhura says the unit will work with the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to monitor the conduct of both politicians and public servants in the province. “The induction and the education are very important to ensure that we don’t only catch the thieves but we make people. The President was talking earlier about consciousness and the conscience we raised that level of doing the right thing was anchored on knowing what the right thing is, knowing what the law says, knowing what the constitution says. Often it is taken for granted that people in the political sphere know that. I think that some of the problems of our democracy is that too many things are taken for granted,” says Makhura.
