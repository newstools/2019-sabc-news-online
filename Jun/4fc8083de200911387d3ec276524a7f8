The man who allegedly tried to rape a 24-year-old intern doctor at Pelonomi hospital is expected to make his first court appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Friday. The doctor managed to free herself after she bit off the suspect’s tongue. The suspect was arrested at National hospital after medical personnel tipped off police upon identifying him while he was seeking medical treatment for his tongue. The incident happened on Tuesday night in the doctor’s quarters at Pelonomi hospital. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says his department has prioritised security upgrades at all health care centres in the country. The statement follows his visit to the family of the intern doctor who escaped the rape earlier this week. Mkhize was accompanied by the Free State premier Sisi Ntombela and provincial Health MEC Montsheng Tsiu. They also interacted with doctors at the hospital. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
