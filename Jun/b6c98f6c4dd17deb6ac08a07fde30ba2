Constantia businessman Rob Packham has been sentenced to 22 years behind bars in the Cape Town High Court for killing his wife. Last month, Packham was convicted of his wife Gill’s brutal murder after her charred body was found in the boot of her burnt car near Diep River in February 2017. Judge Elize Steyn has described the murder as cruel. Steyn says circumstances surrounding the murder warrant a deviation from the minimum sentence of 15 years. “Accordingly on the count of murder you are sentenced to 20 years direct imprisonment on the count of defeat of (the ends of) justice you are sentenced to 4 years as ordered in terms of section 218 of the Criminal Procedure Act and two years of the sentence imposed on count two shall run concurrently with that imposed on count one. You are accordingly sentenced to an effective term of 22 years direct imprisonment.” The state had called for life sentence for the 58-year-old.
