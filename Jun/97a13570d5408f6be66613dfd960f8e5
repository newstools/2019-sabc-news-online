Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says if the African National Congress can prove that its Secretary General Ace Magashule formed the African Transformation Movement (ATM) they can remove him. Reports suggest that former President Kgalema Motlanthe will lead an investigation into Magashule’s alleged role in the formation of ATM. Media reports suggest that the party’s National Working Committee has agreed that Magashule should be investigated. This follows earlier reports that Magashule, alongside former President Jacob Zuma were behind the establishment of the ATM ahead of last month’s general elections. ATM gained two seats in Parliament following the May 8 elections. Speaking on SAfm’s Sunrise, Mathekga says Motlanthe is a person of integrity and will not be accused of playing factional politics. He says he will carry out a fair inquiry. Click below to listen to the full interview.
