The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) has announced that it will launch its Ethics Inquiry into the media industry on Monday. The Inquiry will be chaired by Judge Kathy Satchwell. SANEF chairperson, Mahlatse Mahlase says the probe is an opportunity to restore faith in the country’s media. She encouraged members of the public and media to come forward with any information they may have. “Finally, we are launching it on Monday. The inquiry will interview journalists, editors and members of the public to ascertain whether the media was captured by nefarious forces, and whether by the State or the public sector. So, this is an opportunity to be held accountable, but most importantly to build on our future and to rebuild the credibility that has been lost.” Meanwhile, the prestigious 2019 Nat Nakasa Award for courageous journalism was awarded to Sunday Times’ investigative reporter, Qaanitah Hunter, on Saturday night in Melrose Arch, north of Johannesburg. Hunter was recognised for her body of work, as well as her role in highlighting mental health issues in the journalism industry.
