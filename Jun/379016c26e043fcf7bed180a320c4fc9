Convicted murderer Henri van Breda has filed papers in the Constitutional Court against his conviction and sentence. He was sentenced to three life terms last year for brutally killing his father, mother and older brother with an axe at the De Zalze Estate in Stellenbosch three years ago. Van Breda maintained throughout the trial that his family was hacked to death by an axe wielding intruder. In 2018, handing down the sentence at the Western Cape High Court, Judge Siraj Desai found that 23-year-old Van Breda was guilty and sentenced him to three life sentences for murdering his parents and his brother. Van Breda accused the Western Cape High Court for misdirecting itself by concluding that the proven facts are only consistent with a finding that he was the person who attacked his family. The National Prosecuting AuthorityÂ (NPA) says it has until June 14 to file opposing papers. Related video click below:
