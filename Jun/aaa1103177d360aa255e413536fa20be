The Gauteng Department of Transport says Soweto residents are willing to give rival taxi associations a chance to operate again, provided there’s no repeat of violence. Gauteng Transport MEC, Jacob Mamabolo, met with community members after the re-opening of the Soweto taxi routes and ranks that were closed in March. NANDUWE and WATA’s facilities were closed following a spate of taxi violence in the area which claimed the lives of at least three people. “The feedback from the community is quiet positive. They are willing to give them a second chance, but the condition is that there shouldn’t be a repeat of what happened in this area again. The two taxi associations which is WATA and NANDUWE did apologise to the community, saying that they have caused untold inconvenience to the people of this area,” says Department spokesperson Theo Nkonki.
