The South African Broadcasting Cooperation (SABC) says it is studying the judgement of the South Gauteng High Court over a R6 million contract with auditing firm Sekela Xabiso. This after the public broadcaster lost its court application to set aside the service agreement signed in 2016. The SABC signed the contract with Sekela Xabiso for advisory work relating to irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. However, as the Special Investigating Unit had already investigated and reported on the matter, the SABC and the SIU instituted proceedings to have the contract declared invalid. SABC Spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu says, “This is the matter that was raised in 2016 and investigated by the SIU in terms of the proclamation issued by the President. The SIU has investigated and reported on the matter during December 2017 proceedings were then instituted. By both the SIU and the SABC against Sikel Sigabiso to have a contract with the SABC unlawful and in valid.”
