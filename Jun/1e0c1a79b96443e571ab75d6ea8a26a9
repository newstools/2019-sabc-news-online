The Yeoville community in Johannesburg has expressed anger over the high crime rate in the suburb. They have voiced their concern to Minister of Police Bheki Cele and Minister of Home Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi at the community imbizo underway at the Yeoville recreational centre. Drugs, robbery, and prostitution are just some of the things that have angered the Yeoville community. They complain that despite the escalating crime, police do nothing about it and are pleading with Police Minister Bheki Cele to help rid the area of crime. Meanwhile, some have blamed foreign nationals for the hijacking of buildings, selling of drugs, human trafficking rings and running brothels in so-called guest houses. They say most of them are undocumented but have been permitted to stay allegedly by corrupt police officials who take bribes. Watch related imbizo video below:
