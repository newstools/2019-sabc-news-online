Traffic has been severely disrupted in Sandton, as a result of the march by disgruntled Alexandra residents. The residents led by the Alexandra Shutdown Committee marched from Alexandra to the City of Johannesburg’s Region E offices in Sandown, to voice their grievances. Earlier, protesting residents took to the streets and blockaded several entrances and exits of the township as part of the so-called total shutdown of the area. The planned demonstration follows Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba’s promise to rebuild the illegal structures which were demolished last month. In April, residents went on the rampage in protest over the mushrooming of illegal dwellings in Alexandra. A large contingent of law enforcement officers followed the march and kept a close on protesters to ensure everything went on smoothly. The group of almost 100 people are currently picketing and singing struggle songs on Daisy Street in front of the city offices. Click video below for more:
