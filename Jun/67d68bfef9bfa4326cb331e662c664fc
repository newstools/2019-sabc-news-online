An organization called Hope Restoration Ministries has reacted to the fatal stabbing, which occurred on Monday, of a Grade 10 learner by saying responsibility for school safety cannot be left solely  to the Basic Education Department. The learner was stabbed outside Forest High School in Turffontein, Johannesburg. It says churches, communities and parents must lend a helping hand in curbing school violence. Two other learners sustained injuries. The 20-year-old suspect has been arrested and is expected to appear in court on Wednesday. The Hope Restoration Ministries has called on all members of society to join hands in seeking solutions for what they describe as a social crisis. The church says it has learnt with shock the news of yet another fatal incident involving school children. They’ve been similar incidents in schools around the country in recent months. The church says the department’s Integrated Safety Framework requires multiple stakeholders to take a lead in transforming schools from being places of crime scenes to safe havens that are conducive for learning. It says it would like to partner with the Department of Basic Education in the regeneration of moral standards in schools. WATCH RELATED BELOW:
