Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba is urging city residents to opt for prepaid electricity to avoid the accumulation of debt. Mashaba has announced that the city council has approved a debt relief programme for residents who are struggling. The city council says qualifying customers can get up to 50% of their debt written off if they come forward and make arrangements. Mashaba says the residents owe the city around R6 billion. “As part of debt write off we are encouraging our residents to go on a prepaid because prepaid for us as a city, without any doubt there will be less consumption for us and loss of revenue. But at the end of the day it will help our residents so that they can control their usage of electricity. So we want our people to actually take the responsibility for their own financial situations,” says Mashaba. Watch related video below for more on the story:
