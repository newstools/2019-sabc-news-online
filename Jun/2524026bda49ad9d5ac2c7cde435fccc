Former President, Kgalema Motlanthe, has weighed-in on the recent public spat by senior members of the African National Congress( ANC ) over the expansion of the Reserve Bank‘s mandate. Speaking to the media at the induction of Gauteng’s newly-appointed MECs in Sandton on Thursday, Motlanthe says if the party communicates in multiple voices, the message must be the same. “I think it is the duty and responsibility of any governing party to always ensure that even where they speak in many voices, the message must always be the same. As I said earlier on here that in order to achieve that it means you must have no holy cows, as a team you must debate and discuss so that what you communicate in your multiple voices carries the same message.” Watch video below:
