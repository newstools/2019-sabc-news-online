The South African National Editor’s Forum (SANEF) says it’s deeply saddened by the death of its founding member, veteran journalist Raymond Louw. The 92-year-old multi-award-winning journalist passed away on Wednesday morning at the Morningside Clinic in Johannesburg. His death followed just a day after his wife Jean also passed away. Louw was Deputy Chairperson of the Press Council at the time of his death. His previous roles include being editor of the Sunday Times and The Rand Daily Mail, as well as founder member of the South African Editors Forum (SANEF). In 2011, he was named World Press Freedom Hero by the Vietnam-based International Press Institute. “Deeply saddened by the passing of Oom Ray, like we used to call him, Raymond Louw and sadly his wife also died. Raymond was very very supportive for SANEF. He was 92 when he passed and regardless of his age he was always there for SANEF. He has been a SANEF council member, he attended all the meetings and each time we needed help and advice he was one of those elders that will always be there and support and advice SANEF members,” says SANEF’s Secretary General Moipone Malefane. Meanwhile, the South African Press Council says Louw will be remembered for his media freedom and freedom of expression activism, among his other contributions to journalism. The Press Council’s Amina Frense says Louw will be sorely missed. “He’s been an active participant in media freedom both locally and abroad. He has received many awards and recognition in South Africa itself. Wits University bestowed and honorary doctorate on him in recent years. And he’s also been recognised globally for his media activism and freedom of expression,” says Frense. Watch a related video below:
