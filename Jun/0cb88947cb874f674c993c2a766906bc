Parliament says it cannot cut corners in the matter of it’s suspended Secretary, Gengezi Mgidlana, who has been suspended for the past two years on full pay. He claims an annual salary of more than R2.8 million. His suspension follows allegations of abuse of parliamentary funds. The allegations against Mgidlana include him awarding himself an ex-gratia payment of more than R71 000. He also signed off a R30 000 study bursary and misused blue light security vehicles. The investigation was concluded in November 2017  and the report was then handed to Parliament’s presiding officers. Parliament’s joint standing committee on the financial management of the institution has raised concern about the long delay in proceedings. In May this year, Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, also found Mgidlana guilty of improper conduct. She has given Parliament 30 days to provide her office with an action plan. “The process has not concluded, the guilt or otherwise of the secretary to parliament. So you cannot there start imposing punitive measures such as withholding a salary while the process is still going on. So hence we are saying the process must be allowed to continue until it reaches its’ logical conclusion,” says Parliamentary Spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo. WATCH BELOW:
