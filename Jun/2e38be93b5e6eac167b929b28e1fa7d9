The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Ephraim Mogale municipality in the Sekhukhune area of Limpopo has rejected a VBS report which recommends that the municipal manager involved in depositing millions of rands in VBS Mutual Bank, be suspended for three months. A report compiled by the disciplinary committee recommends that Monica Mathibela be suspended for three months and ordered to attend short courses in management. DA councillor Flip Jacobs deems this as a slap on the wrist. “The council wants to take up the recommendations of the lawyer to reinstate her as the Municipal Manager which we are not happy with. She was part of the VBS scandal, according to us its theft, she knew what she was doing, not adhering to the act that was put in front of her and we think that the damage was already done between the municipality and the MM and she cannot be trusted again to lead the Municipality.” Another opposition party in the Ephraim Mogale municipality, Bolsheviks Party of South Africa, says they too want those implicated in the VBS report to be sacked. Party spokesperson Milton Bolotini also accuses the provincial government of not taking action against those implicated in the VBS scandal. Bolotini says, “We agree as the Bolsheviks party of South Africa in the Sekhukhune region we are supporting whoever that is saying the Premier of Limpopo should be held accountable and should be brought to book by not putting in much effort and much more that is needed to deal with the VBS matter in the Limpopo province.”
