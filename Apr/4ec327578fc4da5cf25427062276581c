Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear that Britain needs to be brought back together after the 2016 Brexit referendum, her spokesman said when asked about her chief whip’s comments that a softer Brexit had been inevitable after the 2017 election. Earlier, Julian Smith, her parliamentary enforcer, told the BBC that May’s loss of her majority at a 2017 election would “inevitably” lead government to accept a softer Brexit and that her ministers had shown the “worst example of ill-discipline” in British political history. “The PM made it clear that there was a need to bring the country back together after the Brexit vote and that is what they (the government) are working to achieve,” her spokesman told reporters. “This is a subject that brings out strong emotions in MPs on all sides of the debate, I think what is important is that everybody in government continues to work towards the goal of delivering on the referendum verdict.”
