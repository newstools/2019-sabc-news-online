There were lots of smiles at Garies in the Northern Cape as the Non-Government Organisation, Gift of the Givers, brought some relief to the drought-stricken area. The Namaqualand has been declared a disaster area several times in the last few years and is in the process of yet another declaration. The drought in the Namaqualand is nearing its sixth year and farmers are devastated but the kindness of strangers has lifted their spirits. The Gift of the Givers rolled in with six trucks carrying mielies, potatoes, fodder, water and food parcels. The Northern Cape Agriculture department says apart from providing drought relief, they are also conducting research for climate-smart farming. Relief organisations say donations keep streaming in but they are being delayed by prohibitive diesel costs. WATCH BELOW:
