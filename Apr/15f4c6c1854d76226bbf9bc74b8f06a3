A detective commander from the Driekop Police Station in Limpopo and a 32 year-old woman have been arrested for alleged corruption, extortion and defeating the ends of justice. The two colluded to extort R15 000 from the woman’s boyfriend. It’s alleged that the woman opened a case of rape against her boyfriend and the detective commander claimed he could squash the case if he paid the R15 000. Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Matimba Maluleke says the two are expected to appear at the Burgersfort Magistrate’s Court on Monday. “The complainant was told about the case of rape that was opened against him by the girlfriend or to pay R15 000 for the case to be squashed. The complainant allegedly paid R4 000 on the spot on agreement that he will pay the rest later. The girlfriend was arrested after receiving money from the complainant. The warrant office was arrested later in the day,” says Maluleke.
