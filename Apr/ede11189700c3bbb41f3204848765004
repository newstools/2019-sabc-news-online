The Mayor of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba, is meeting with Alexandra community leaders on Friday at an undisclosed venue. Residents have been asking the mayor to come and listen to their grievances since they started their protests last week Wednesday. They even marched to the city’s regional offices on Monday but the mayor could not come and receive their memorandum of demands. Alexandra residents are concerned about the mushrooming of illegal dwellings in the township and the seemingly inaction by the Joburg Metro Police Department to enforce by-laws and stop the erection of the structures. Residents are also aggrieved about the service delivery failures.  Mayoral spokesperson, Luyanda Mfeka, says the meeting is a precursor to a public meeting he’s planned for next Monday in Alexandra. “Today’s meeting is aimed at ensuring that the politicisation of the real grievances of Alex does not continue, and rather that all political leaders within Alex arrive on Monday with the sole aim of ensuring that only the grievances of the residents of Alex take centre stage,” says Mfeka.
