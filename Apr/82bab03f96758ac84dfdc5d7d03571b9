Police have managed to disperse a group that was trying to block Louis Botha Avenue in Orange Grove in Johannesburg. The community of Orange Grove had planned to embark on a protest over poor service delivery. They want Mayor Herman Mashaba to allocate houses to poor families. They also want unused buildings to be converted into proper housing for people to live in. Gauteng police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says, “I’m at Orange Grove at the moment traffic is flowing at Louis Botha Avenue. There was a group of about 50 people that attempted to block Louis Botha but we managed to disperse them.
