Residents of Mganduzweni, outside White River, Mpumalanga, have burnt to death two men suspected to be involved in the killing of two girls. Police says one of them is a local pastor. The bodies of two girls aged between five and six were found dumped in a ditch on Wednesday morning. The children disappeared while playing outside their home on Tuesday afternoon. Residents accuse the two suspects of dealing in human body parts. Police spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi, says a mob attacked the two men in their home. “The community of Mganduzweni today during the early hours, killed two men which one of them we are told is a local pastor. They are suspecting them of being involved in the death of the two children. However, as the police, we have spoken to the community yesterday and will continue doing so to say; to take the law and place it in your hands is criminal and now that they have killed these two people, which they suspect without having investigated; they have actually killed evidence that we suppose to use as the police. That is the danger part of it.” The residents have accused the police of failing to render policing services. WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
