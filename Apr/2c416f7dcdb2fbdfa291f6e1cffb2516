Residents of Krugersdorp are living in fear as illegal miners are becoming more brazen and more dangerous. This after a shootout, believed to be part of an alleged turf war in Wentworth Park, kept residents awake and fearful for their safety. This took place at the Lancaster Mine Gold Plant in Luipaardsvlei over the past few days. The public relations officer for the Sector 4 Community Policing Forum Sharday van den Berg says, “It’s difficult because they outnumber us so much and the manpower is just not there. We’re going to really have to make some type of a plan so that we can get in there with a proper plan to cover them.” “I mean we’re going in completely blindfolded. We’ve got some aerial footage, we are shocked to see where they are hiding while we are trying to chase them out of the area; and they all armed, we don’t have a chance against these guys,” she adds.
