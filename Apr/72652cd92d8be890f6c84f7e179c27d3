There have been mixed reactions from residents in Limpopo, following the ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on the VhaVenda kingship. The court has set aside the 2012 decision by former President Jacob Zuma to declare Toni Mphephu the King of the VhaVenda. The court has also declared unlawful the August 2010 decision by the Mphephu-Ramabulana Royal Family Council to recognise Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana as King. Princess Masindi Mphephu took the matter to the SCA, arguing that the Customary Law of male succession, which led to the recognition of her uncle, Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana, as the King of VhaVenda had violated her right to equality. Some residents in Louis Trichardt expressed their views. “It is the best decision because in SA we are governed by the Constitution and all men and women are equal,” says one of the residents. Another resident says, “As an elderly woman, I’m asking myself if she will be able to lead the nation as a woman. Men must be leaders. I don’t think she will be able to lead as a woman. Toni Mphephu must be the King. A woman cannot lead the nation.” Click below for more on the story:
