The office of the President has denied that the possible release of AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo from prison is part of electioneering. Presidency spokesperson, Khusela Diko, says President Cyril Ramaphosa will not allow such distortion of information to pressure him on deciding on the parole application by Dalindyebo. Minister of Justice Michael Masutha had earlier furnished the President with documents, as per his request on whether or not, Dalindyebo will be granted a Oresidential pardon. Diko says the President will take time and study the documents and make a decision in due course. “We must hasten to add that this is not the only application that the President is dealing with – it’s very unfortunate that some of us, among us, would have wanted to use this as an electioneering tool, calling the President to make the decision because people won’t vote. That is not what’s going to drive the decision by the President, but rather what is in the public interest and whether indeed it fits in with the requirements of the law.” Masutha says it’s entirely up to the President to make a decision on the AbaThembu King. “We have submitted all the information together with the documents needed, attached to the pardon to the President – and at this stage, the honour is really on the President because its up to him in terms of section 24 of the constitution to grant or refuse pardon and that where the matter is at this point in time.”  WATCH BELOW:
