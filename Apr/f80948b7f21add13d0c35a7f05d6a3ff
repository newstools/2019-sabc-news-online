The Alexandra Shutdown movement will on Tuesday convene to plan for another shutdown of the area expected to take place sometime this week. On Monday, residents from the township, north of Johannesburg, marched to the City of Joburg’s Sandton regional offices to hand over their memorandum. They demanded that mayor Herman Mashaba come personally to receive their memorandum but to no avail. Residents are demanding improved service delivery and are also calling on the city to deal with the mushrooming of illegal structures in the area. Since last Wednesday, sporadic protests flared up in the township bringing business and schooling to a standstill. Gauteng Premier David Makhura tweeted to say he will be in Alexandra on Tuesday but his office is yet to confirm this.  Alexandra community leader Sandile Mavundla says they will intensify their protests. He says: “The plan of action today is to make the situation calm in Alexandra but we are gearing up for a total shutdown. People already indicated when we dispersed on Monday that they want to see the Premier, they want to see the President, the minister who is responsible for COGTA or they will revolt and be unstoppable.” Watch below for the latest
