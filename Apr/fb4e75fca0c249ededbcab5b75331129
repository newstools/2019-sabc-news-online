Higher Education Minister, Naledi Pandor has dissolved the council of the University of Fort Hare (UFH) in the Eastern Cape. The move follows reports of strife within the university council. Minister Pandor has appointed former Wits Vice Chancellor, Professor Loyiso Nongxa, as an administrator and his duties will resume immediately for 12 months. Higher Education Spokesperson, Lunga Ngqengelele says the minister took a decision to intervene to ensure good governance and a conducive environment for learning. “The Minister of Higher Education and Training Dr Naledi Pandor has appointed Prof Loyiso Nongxa as the administrator for the University of Fort Hare. Of course, this came after the minister received a number of damning reports, as well as suggestions that the council at Fort Hare has collapsed. So, the appointment is there with immediate effect.”
