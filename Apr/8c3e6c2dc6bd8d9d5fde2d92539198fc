The ANC has distanced itself from Tuesday night’s disruption of the launch of Pieter-Louis Myburgh’s book titled ‘Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule’s web of capture’. A group of protesters with some wearing ANC t-shirts stormed into the Exclusive Books store and vandalised it at Sandton City where the launch of the book was held. Acting National Spokesperson Dakota Legoete says the ANC condemns the incident in the strongest possible terms. He says individuals who disrupted the launch of the book did not do so in the name of the party and that the ANC views the incident in a very serious light, as it undermines freedom of speech. Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League in the Free State encourages burning investigative journalist Myburgh’s book on the party’s secretary-general Ace Magashule. “We did not arrange for anyone, those people themselves, they went there. We are going to lobby our people. So we are going to engage them and encourage them to burn all of those books because that book in its character it’s a satanist devilish book that seeks to divide this country – that wants to reverse the gains of this democracy. It’s launched now because the Stratcom wants to ensure that the ANC doesn’t win this election. They want to bring doubts amongst the African people here in South Africa.” Click on videos below:
