There’s lots to celebrate, especially for black people whose lives have significantly improved since the collapse of Apartheid. That’s the message from KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Willies Mchunu, during his Freedom Day address in Umlazi, south of Durban. ‘Changing the lives of people’ that’s the legacy of the past 25 years according to the KwaZulu-Natal government.  Mchunu says people now have basic services they didn’t have under Apartheid. He says health and education in rural parts of the province have been dramatically improved. Mchunu also used the occasion to condemn violent protests and the burning of infrastructure. Those who attended the Freedom Day event had mixed views on the meaning of the day. Victims of the recent floods which ravaged KwaZulu-Natal were also remembered.
