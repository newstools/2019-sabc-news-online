Home Affairs Minister Siyabonga Cwele says South Africa spends a significant amount of money annually deporting illegal immigrants to their countries of origin. His statement follows a meeting aimed establishing a grand plan which will deal with attacks on foreign nationals. International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and Police Minister Bheki Cele attended the meeting that was held in Pretoria after a spate of attacks on some foreign nationals in Durban last weekend. Cwele says sometimes the deported immigrants find their way back to South Africa. “We have the figures to the amassers but it would irresponsible for to put as if there’s a big amount we are losing through this deportation. Yes it is worrying us; it is worrying that we are spending a significant amount over four years just for deportations. Because we have a responsibility to do that – once we have arrested them we must deport them within a certain period of time.”
