Motorists are advised to travel with caution and switch on their vehicle’s lights while travelling over the Easter weekend – amid fog patches in KwaZulu Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape. This after two fatal crashes were reported amid bad weather conditions on the N1 north of Limpopo and on the Amajuba Pass in northern KZN on Thursday. Meteorologist Sihle Kunene, says, “We have weather hazards that might affect your travelling patterns. Most people are going to be travelling from or to Gauteng. If you are going towards KZN or Mpumalanga – we are talking about a fatal crash around Newcastle. There are fog patches there and are expected to stay there for a longer period of time mainly because of the cooler temperatures that we are experiencing. The fog patches are also spreading towards the EC and when it is time for fog patches turn on all your lights.”
