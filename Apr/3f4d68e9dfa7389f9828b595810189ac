Franch President, Emmanuel Macron, says he wants to create a national day of commemoration for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. France has been accused of providing weapons and military training to the Hutu-dominated government in the years that led up to the genocide. Sunday marks the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800 thousand people were killed. Rwanda’s High Commissioner to South Africa ,Vincent Karega, says his country welcomes the token of apology from France for the genocide survivors to find closure. “It’s important to work with Rwanda as the population is known to the world and should teach people to avoid similar occurrences in their countries. It’s of great value to unite and to work together. Acknowledging the wrongdoing and committing to a better future together. What we don’t like is denial or arrogance towards the survivors. ”
