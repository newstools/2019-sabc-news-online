There’s a strong police presence in Alexandra north of Johannesburg to monitor a community protest.  Residents of Alexandra have threatened to shut down the entire township in protest over what they say is the mushrooming of shacks and other illegal structures in the area. They say they’ve complained to the City of Johannesburg but nothing has been done to deal with this. Police have been deployed in the area after the protest leaders threatened to disrupt traffic on the highways including the M1. Wayne Minaar speaks for the Johannesburg Metro Police Department. “There are a lot of officers deployed strategically in Alex. But they’ve seen a small group at Vasco and fourth avenue burning tyres and then there was another small group Lenin road.  But it has not disrupted any traffic.”
