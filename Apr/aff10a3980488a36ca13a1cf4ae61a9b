Transport minister, Blade Nzimande says the big problem on the country’s roads is people not respecting the rules of the road, leading to car crashes. Nzimande was speaking to SABC News at a roadblock in Marianhill toll plaza in Durban. Law enforcement agencies are out in full force to ensure people are driving safe while checking vehicle worthiness. Several minibus taxis have been removed from the road after they failed road worthiness checks. Nzimande says they are pleased that road fatalities have somewhat reduced compared to last year’s Easter Monday. He says: “Owners and drivers get on the road without actually respecting the rules of the road which is a big challenge that we have to deal with as government. Nevertheless we are at least heartened by the fact that compared to this time last year during Easter weekend fatalities reduced by 40%.” Full interview below
