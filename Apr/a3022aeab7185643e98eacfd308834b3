Comair has welcomed a Labour Court interdict which prevents NUMSA ground staff from striking. Comairâ€™s Executive Director in the Airline Division, Wrenelle Stander, says the company would have preferred to resolve the situation through negotiation. It had sought the interdict to ensure its customers reached their destinations. Comair still encourages their customers to check-in online and to use the dedicated bag drop counters. Meanwhile NUMSA says it has noted the decision of the Labour Court in relation to the interdict with Comair and is studying the judgement. They will decide a way forward in due course. Hundreds of NUMSA affiliated members downed tools last week over salary disparities.
