Police in KwaZulu-Natal have remained mum on the spade of robberies and break-ins at the KwaMashu Police Station, north of Durban. The township is notorious for serious crimes such as armed robberies and killings. Now the local police station has been a victim of strings of crime in the past two years targeting dockets and fire-arms. Community members, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say they feel unsafe. The community has called on authorities to intervene. “It is sad that we are never told what happens to our police station even though we live next to it. We are living in constant fear now, if our own police station can be continuously robbed.  Our safety has been compromised and the break-in also makes one wonder how possible it is for the thieves to have access information like case dockets. It’s strange and I think the answers should come from the station itself,” said a community member. KwaZulu-Natal Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele refused to comment.
