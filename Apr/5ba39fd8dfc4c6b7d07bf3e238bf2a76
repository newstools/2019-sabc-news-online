The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says it will continue with mediation talks with Comair management under the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) on Saturday – in the hope of finding a solution to their wage dispute. The union embarked on strike on Thursday morning, saying some workers at Comair earn higher wages than others for doing the same work. However later in the day, the Labour Court awarded Comair an interim order interdicting the strike. Numsa Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says: “As Numsa we remain hopeful that we will find one another so that we will not have to resort to strike action once again. On Tuesday, we are also expecting the Labour court to furnish us with reasons as to why they granted Comair an interim interdict to block the strike. Judgement in this matter was reserved. Our next move will depend on the mandate given to us by our members.” Watch the video below for more:
