A man accused of terrorising women and their daughters by raping them in several villages near the North West capital Mahikeng, is expected to appear in the Mmabatho Regional Court on Tuesday morning. The accused is facing 16 counts of rape that allegedly took place from 2016 to date. Recently it emerged in court that in some instances, he would attack his victims inside their houses while others were kidnapped and dragged to nearby bushes and raped. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Advocate McDonald Ndimande says the matter is expected to be referred to the North West High Court of Mahikeng.
