Gauteng residents can expect severe storms in most parts of the province. The South African Weather Service says severe thunderstorm, hail, flooding and damaging wind should be expected. Residents can expect temperatures of around 22 degrees Celsius in Johannesburg, Springs and Vereeniging. “The thing that people need to understand when they read this information is that we are not saying that there will be hail and flooding from 2 o’clock straight up until 4 o’clock. What we are communicating is that we are expecting storm over the province and between those times there is a risk that some of these storms may become severe,” says Weather Forecaster, Jacqueline Modika.
