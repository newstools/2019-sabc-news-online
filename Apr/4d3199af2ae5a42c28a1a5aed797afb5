Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has called for a meeting with ward councillors of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, next week, to address their grievances. Earlier on Friday, angry residents gathered in at the San Kopano Hall in their numbers expecting a meeting with Mashaba. However he did not pitch, saying he was not notified about the meeting. Since Wednesday, community members have been protesting. They have been blockading roads and disrupting businesses and schooling. Mashaba says he will meet with all ward councillors of Alexandra sometime next week, where they will discuss a solution to the grievances of the community.  In a statement, Mashaba says he was not informed about Friday’s meeting and that he was attending a civic funeral in the city, which rendered him unavailable for a meeting. While gathered at the hall, scores of outraged residents said that due to Mashaba’s failure to meet them, they will embark on a protest in Sandton on Monday. They say they feel disrespected by Mashaba as he should have addressed the community directly and not through the media.
