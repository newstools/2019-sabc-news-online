As Jews around the world marked the final day of Passover on Saturday, a service at a synagogue in the US turned deadly when a teenage gunman opened fire. One woman was killed while the Rabbi and two others were wounded. The shooting occurred in the state of California in a town called Poway. The incident comes exactly six months after 11 people were shot dead at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Following the latest shooting, 19-year old gunman John Earnest was arrested as he tried to flee the scene. Around 100 people were in the synagogue at the time of the shooting but Earnest’s gun malfunctioned preventing more carnage. Police found a hate-filled manifesto on his social media accounts. This latest deadly attack on a place of worship follows that of the Christchurch mosque shooting,  and Sri Lanka church bombings.
