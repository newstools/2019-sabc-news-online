Labour Analyst, Tony Heaney, says it is unlikely that the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) will get deregistered. The Labour Registrar, Daniel Molefe, issued the notice of intention to cancel the registration of AMCU for not operating according to the Labour Relations Act in the government gazette. AMCU is one of the largest trade unions in the mining sector and has thousands of members at gold and platinum mines operated by companies including Sibanye-Stillwater and Lonmin. “I think they will in all likelihood get their house in order and that they won’t be deregistered and if they are, they will undoubtedly go to the labour court. AMCU is almost too big to fail, too significant it has a big footprint especially in platinum and coal and it’s unlikely that a union with approximately 200 000 members is going to just be wiped off the map in the coming months,” says Heaney.
