The Dutch Reformed Church building in Redelinghuys on the Cape West Coast had been destroyed in a fire. Former Church Minister, Ds Jan van Schoor, says he feels devastated that the 92-year-old Church building has burnt down. He says the fire spread so rapidly, that their closest fire services at Piketberg, about 45-minutes away, would not have been able to save the building. Van Schoor says they will however still be able to have their Sunday service in the Church Hall, which is still intact. “The fire started approximately seven o’clock this (Tuesday) morning. There was some sort of an electrical problem and all of a sudden there was just smoke coming from the building and within half an hour the fire was so huge, nothing could have been done to it anyway. The plan at the moment is we’re going to have a service in the church hall, nothing happened to it.”
