Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato has condemned the on-going torching of trains at Cape Town Station. In the latest incident, two trains were set alight in what Metrorail management says is a deliberate act. Extensive damage estimated at R33 million was caused after 12 coaches and two platforms were damage. Plato says those involved must be arrested. “These perpetrators are of the opinion they can continue doing what they want because there’s inability from Prasa and police intelligence to deal with this. I’m calling for an urgent meeting with Prasa management, police provincial commissioner and Western Cape minister for transport.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/679194">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
