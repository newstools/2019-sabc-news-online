South Sudanese President, Salva Kiir, has offered to mediate in the on-going political transition in Sudan after last week’s fall of President Omar al-Bashir. Kiir’s office says he’s ready to support the “democratic aspirations” of his former adversary in Khartoum and help bring about a peaceful transition. South Sudan’s Petroleum Minister told Reuters he had travelled to Khartoum to meet the new leadership alongside a high-level delegation that included Juba’s security service chief and a presidential adviser on security. Kiir’s move comes seven months after al-Bashir helped mediate a shaky peace deal between Kiir and the main opposition rebel group in South Sudan, which won independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of conflict.
