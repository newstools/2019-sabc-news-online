The PIC Commission of Inquiry resumes in Pretoria. Last week, United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader,Â Bantu Holomisa, testified at the Commission of Inquiry into impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) in Pretoria. He urged the PIC to upgrade their spread sheet of unlisted transactions as there were many deals that needed to be investigated. Lawyers representing the Lebashe Investment Group, have lashed out at UDM leader Bantu Holomisa for failing to give concrete evidence. Holomisa wants the Commission of Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to probe the Group for corruption and conflict of interest for loans it received from the PIC. Both Lebashe and Holomisa are involved in a litigation case over the matter.
