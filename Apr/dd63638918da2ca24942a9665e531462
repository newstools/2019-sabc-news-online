Transport Minister, Blade Nzimande, has reiterated government’s call for motorists to remain vigilant on the roads over the Easter weekend. Traffic volumes are expected to peak during the course of the day, amid cold and wet weather conditions across KwaZulu Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape. Nzimande has urged people to be patient, amid the influx of vehicles on the roads. “We are talking to the motorists and encouraging them to observe the rules of the road, drive safety, buckle up, no use of the cell phone, all the things that lead to problems and crashes. Also we are emphasizing the importance of child seats. Year after year we have the same challenges of most road crashes being the result of the human factor – human error, recklessness, drunken driving and so on. We want road worthy vehicles, people with drivers’ licenses but we are prioritising drunken driving.” Watch for more:
