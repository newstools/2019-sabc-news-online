There is shortage of water in some parts of Polokwane and surrounding villages in Limpopo. The Polokwane municipality attributes the problem to leaking pipes at the Ebenezer dam. Municipal spokesperson Thipa Selala says the technicians from the water authority from Lepelle Northern Water  are repairing the pipes. “Lepelle Northern Water has just informed Polokwane Municipality that divers from Department of Water and Sanitation are currently fixing the problem in the dam. Affected areas of supply include Segwashi, Boyne, Ga-Molepo, Mentz, Badimong, Mankweng, Ga-Thoka, Ga-Mothiba, Dalmada and the entire city supply area. The water board has estimated that it would take about three hours for the situation to be resolved. Areas affected are urged to use water sparingly.”
