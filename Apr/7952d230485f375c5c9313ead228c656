Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has been granted more time to file his evidence in the so-called rogue unit case with the public protector’s office. This after Busisiwe Mkhwebane subpoenaed him for it earlier this month. Minister Pravin Gordhan had until 1 pm on Wednesday to hand over all evidence relating to his alleged establishment of an allegedly clandestine illegal intelligence unit or ‘rogue unit’ Spokesperson for the Public Protector Oupa Segalwe explains… “It is in the spirit of fairness, we get this now and then when we investigate complaints, you find that an implicated party is not ready to submit the required information by the day of the deadline and so they would write to the Public Protector to request more time so that they can collect the necessary information. In this case, the minister has indicated that some of the information that the Public Protestor requires dates back to a number of years. He would need enough time to gather that information so that he can comply.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/680110">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
