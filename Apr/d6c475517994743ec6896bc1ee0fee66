Police Minister, Bheki Cele says police have a comprehensive plan to ensure that voting on May 8 is executed smoothly. Cele and other ministers in the justice, crime prevention and security cluster briefed the media in Pretoria on Government’s plans to ensure a safe and fair election process. With over 22 000 voting stations around the country, Cele says they have identified a number of hotspots which will be closely watched. “One of those hotspots is where we have ANC and IFP. There are areas which still have inter-political problems.  In KwaZulu-Natal, they are not too many, but they are still there.” The minister also said law and order will prevail during the May 8 general elections. This despite the eruption of sporadic service delivery protests across the country. Some communities where these protests are happening have threatened not to allow elections to take place if their demands are not met.
