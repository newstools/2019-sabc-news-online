The Western Cape Department of Local Government and Environmental Affairs says dam levels in the province currently stand at more than 36%. This is more than double compared to the same time last year. Dams supplying the City of Cape Town stand at more than 48%. A spokesperson for the Department, James- Brent Styan says they are still concerned about the water situation in the Karoo as a result of the drought. He says the situation in the Karoo remains quite serious as the drought continues unabated. The provincial government will be visiting the area later this week to talk about various interventions.
