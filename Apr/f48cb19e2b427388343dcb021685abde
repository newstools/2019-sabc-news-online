The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee will on Monday hold a special meeting in Irene, outside Pretoria. The meeting is expected to deliberate on the party’s election campaign so far as well as its parliamentary candidates’ list. The party has received criticism, including from its own Veterans’ League, for placing a number of people on the list, who have been fingered in state capture allegations. The meeting of the ANC’s highest decision-making body will also have to tackle allegations that its secretary-general Ace Magashule tampered with the list which he has denied.
