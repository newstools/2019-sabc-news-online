The Labour department’s registrar says there is nothing sinister about its intention to deregister the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu). This after the Department of Labour announced its intention to cancel the registration of the trade union. The department says Amcu is not operating according to its constitution. The labour department’s decision stems from Amcu’s failure to hold a national congress in 2018. This as the union’s constitution stipulates that it will hold an elective conference once every five years. In a statement, the office of the registrar explains that its numerous inquiries on the congress were met with hostility. The registrar says that Amcu accused the office of being inconsistent in its approach when dealing with unions. The registrar Lehlogonolo Molefe further explained that the department has to hold Amcu accountable to its own constitution to prevent infighting. This as a national congress serves the purpose of electing office bearers. The labour department has given the union 60 days to explain why it should not be deregistered. Amcu will hold a media briefing on Friday to response to the labour department’s announcement.
