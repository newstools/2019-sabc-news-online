Families of the 13 victims, who died when part of a church wall collapsed on them, will officially identify the bodies of their loved ones on Tuesday at the Richards Bay mortuary on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. The victims were 12 women and a 13-year-old boy. The women and boy died when part of the church wall collapsed at the Pentecostal Holiness Church at eMpangeni on the north coast of the province. It’s believed the wall collapsed due to heavy rains. During a Special Sitting of the KZN Executive Council in Durban, provincial premier Willies Mchunu said a special forensic team is probing whether the church wall collapsed due to structural defects. Mchunu says government will also provide psychological assistance to the affected families. “Government and the church will support the affected families as they visit the mortuary in Umhlathuze to identify their loved ones. The Department of health and that of social development will be there to provide pyschological support and medical care. Many families will be gathered together and you will know that grief has a contagious effect. As one family gets affected by misery the other families are also likely to get affected.” Click on the video below:
