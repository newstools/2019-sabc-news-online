Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba’s office says he has not received any information inviting him to attend Friday’s community meeting in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. Alexandra residents have threatened to take their protest to Johannesburg’s commercial hub, Sandton, should Mashaba not attend the scheduled meeting. Residents want Mashaba to provide answers to their service delivery concerns and their calls for the removal of illegal dwellings. Mayoral spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka says on Thursday a meeting was due to take place between the Mayor and the leadership, however it was subsequently cancelled. He says at this stage the Mayor has not received any communication for further engagements or a meeting between himself and the community leaders. “However the city remains open to engaging with those leaders,” adds Mfeka. Alexandra community leader Sandile Mavudla says this is a clear demonstration that Mashaba does not have the interest of the community at heart. He says: “The President instructed the Mayor to come and address the people of Alexandra. The call was made by the President, so he did not respect even the President himself. So I don’t think Mashaba is taking everyone serious.” Watch related video below…
