The parents of an 18-year-old learner are suing a teacher and the Limpopo Education Department after the teen was allegedly assaulted at school. The incident happened at Malebo Secondary School at Steiloop outside Lephalale in May last year. The grade 10 learner was allegedly strangled after being accused of cheating during an exam. Medical reports show that his mental state, physical mobility, and speech have been affected. The department has declined to speak on the matter, saying it is sub judice.
