Mxolisi Zondo – the brother of the Chairperson of Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Deputy Chief Justice Chairperson Raymond Zondo – is said to have been implicated in former Independent Police Investigative Directorate Robert McBride’s evidence. McBride is testifying  at the commission on Thursday. The head of the commission’s legal team, Paul Pretorius, brought this to light in an effort to find out how Zondo will deal with the matter. He sought advice on whether Zondo should recuse himself for part of the testimony that deals with his brother’s implications.
