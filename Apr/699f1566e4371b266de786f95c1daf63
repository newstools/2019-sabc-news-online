A private security employee who is alleged to have gunned down his girlfriend and her mother and critically wounded their two-year-old daughter at Lonely Park in Mahikeng, North West is expected to apply for bail on Thursday morning. The incident happened late last year. The suspect, Boitshoko Swanepoel, had earlier abandoned bail citing his safety. Thirty year-old Swanepoel is facing two charges of murder after 29-year-old Motlalepula Motsatsing and her 52-year-old mother, Lenah were gunned down. He also allegedly wounded a 25-year-old relative and is therefore also facing two charges of attempted murder. He was arrested in Setlagole a few days after the incident. The relative and the little girl sustained serious injuries and were hospitalised in Gauteng.
