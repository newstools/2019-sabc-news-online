Limpopo Transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje has expressed shock at the road crash that claimed the lives of ten people on the N1 near Kranskop. Ten people were killed when a taxi collided head on with a truck. It is believed that a taxi which was transporting 11 passengers from Zimbabwe to Gauteng had a tyre burst when it lost control and collided with a truck. Two passengers escaped unhurt. Makhurupetje says: “We are expecting millions of people who will be entering the province from different directions. We have made plans for the N1 to make sure that we ease traffic congestion on the road. We are very disappointed that this morning we just lost ten people at a go. This Kumbi was coming from Zimbabwe to Gauteng, the driver was driving at a high speed when he lost control and collided head on with a truck which unfortunately burnt as well.” The truck and taxi collision has led to the closure of the N1 between Kranskop and Modimolle. Motorists are being diverted to use the R101 as traffic and police are investigating and clearing the scene. Watch the video below for more:
