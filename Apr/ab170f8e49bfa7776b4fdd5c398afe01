Police have managed to quell two separate service delivery protests in Hillbrow in the Johannesburg CBD and Ennerdale south of Johannesburg on Monday morning. Residents in both areas took to the streets in the early hours of morning, burning tyres and blockading roads. However, law enforcement managed to disperse protesters and have since reopened the roads to traffic. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says,”There was an attempt to burn tyres and protest at provincial road and Percy road in Ennerdale, however that fire was extinguished by officers and there was also an attempt to start a protest in Hillbrow, Plein Street and Pretoria Street. That to was extinguished because information was received yesterday of the planned protest in the CBD and also in Ennerdale – but there was officers on duty there since very early from 3am to monitor both areas. The situation is both areas is now under control.”
