Dros rape accused Nicholas Ninow has been admitted to hospital. Department of Correctional Services spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo says Ninow reported to a medical facility in prison and the doctors then referred him to an external medical facility. Ninow is accused of raping a minor girl at a Dros restaurant in Pretoria. He was arrested in September last year and has been in custody since. Nxumalo dismissed rumours that Ninow was admitted to hospital because he injected himself with a concoction of drugs. ” As DCS it does concern us that an organistion ‘NotInMyName’ issued a statement alleging that Mr. Ninow may have overdosed on drugs. As a department we must state it clearly that at no point such information was brought before us, even in terms of our records there is nothing indicating that this was the case.”
