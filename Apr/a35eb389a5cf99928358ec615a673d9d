Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says the Second Chance Matric Programme is not only for those who did not pass their matric. Addressing hundreds of young people at KwaBhaca in the Eastern Cape, Motshekga says the programme also provides support to those who will write their supplementary exams and part-time learners. “What we do, really, is to work across government and say ‘what is that we can still do for children who are not still in school; who are not in employment and not in training?’ That’s why we always partner with the SETA and youth forums. In Gauteng, it is much more nicer. There is this program called one million, which is a provincial youth program.” Motshekga says, “What we do really is to work across government and say what is that we can still do with children who are not still in school, who are not in employment and not in training.
