The Eastern Cape government received a R1.2 billion cash injection from the national treasury of which R880 million is earmarked for a number of municipalities across the province. The drought stricken Makhanda Municipality gets R22 million. The allocation will go towards the refurbishment of the aging water infrastructure in the City of Saints. The James Kleinhans water treatment plant has been partly refurbished and is yielding results. Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, says that he is confident that Makhanda will not reach day zero. “It is something that will come a long way in alleviating the water issues people had here. Already we can see the water is near adequate and the only consequence we have now is dealing with drought on the western side. The measures that have been put in place, we are confident that we won’t reach day zero.” The work at the James Kleinhans water treatment plant has increased its water yield from 10 to 13 mega litres per day. The long term goal is to establish a flow of 20 mega litres per day to Makhanda. The provincial government appointed Amatola Water to assist the municipality in building its water supply capacity over the next three months. Amatola Area Operations Manager, Chris Nair, says when they are done, the operational standard must be followed through by officials in the area. “We are able to push 13 megs out of the plant which is quite phenomenal when we started here it was not the case and we are also compliant on the water quality so its a huge spin off. So when we are done here in three months the operational standard must be followed through by officials on the ground.” The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro will receive R233 million for drought relief, agricultural reservoir maintenance and environmental aid. Other beneficiary municipalities include, Sunday’s River, Koukamma, Kouga, Ndlame, and Dr Beyers Naude. The OR Tambo, Amathole and Chris Hani district municipalities will also get money.
