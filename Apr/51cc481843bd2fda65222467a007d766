The US Consulate has given more than 40 young people from various parts of KwaZulu-Natal training in job readiness. The training is aimed at assisting young people in the country to secure jobs globally and address the challenges of unemployment. As part of the training, these young people have been given skills on how to conduct interviews and improve their CVs. The US Consulate’s spokesperson in Durban, Sherry Sykes says, “One thing the US government is trying to do here is to give young people hope so that they can have a brighter future, if they can go out and grasp it. We care and a lot of people care that they succeed and we are here to help them.” Meanwhile, beneficiaries of the project have called on the US Consulate to give more young people in the country a similar opportunity. “For me, this was an amazing opportunity and I am grateful. There are so many people out there who must get this opportunity,” says one recipient.
