President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed former Consumer Councillor, Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi, as the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Deputy Board Chairperson and retained Bongumusa Makhathini as Chairperson.  Mohlala-Mulaudzi was one of eight candidates that were appointed to fill the vacancies on the  Board. Ramaphosa’s decision to appoint the SABC Board comes a day after he met with the Minister of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. The Presidency says the President has satisfied himself with all the names and processes that were followed by the National Assembly to choose the best candidates. The appointment of the eight new Board members including Mohlala-Mulaudzi and the retention of Makahthini will bring the current four member non-executive inquorate Board back to become fully functional.
