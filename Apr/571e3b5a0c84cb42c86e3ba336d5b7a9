British Prime Minister Theresa May will head to Brussels on Wednesday to meet leaders of the other 27 EU member states in the hope of winning a second delay to Britain’s departure date. The coming days will be among the most crucial since Britain voted almost three years ago to end its membership of the European Union (EU). Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday unless a further extension is agreed. May said that when she goes to Brussels on Wednesday she will seek a short extension to Article 50, the measure that signaled Britain’s intention to leave the EU, with June 30 cited as a target date. Donald Tusk, European Council President, is proposing to offer the UK a 12 month “flexible” extension, he will put this before EU leaders on Wednesday’s summit. It is expected that if May’s plea for another Brexit extension is not agreed on, the UK would be very much likely to leave the EU without a deal on Friday.
