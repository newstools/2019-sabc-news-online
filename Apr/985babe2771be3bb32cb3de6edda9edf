Labour is calling for better representation on government’s Fourth Industrial Revolution Commission. The launch comes a day after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the establishment of the commission. It aims to develop a nationwide strategy to respond to challenges brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Solidarity’s Secretary General made the call during the 4IRSA and Digital Economy Summit launch  in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, on Thursday. Government, Academia and Business have partnered to launch 4IRSA Digital Economy Summit. The event will be held in June 2019 under the theme #4IRSA Partnership. Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says the partnership aims to facilitate dialogue to develop a national response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Ndabeni-Abrahams has reiterated the importance of working together to ensure that the jobs blood bath is managed.  Solidarity has asked for a seat in the Presidential 4IR commission, saying representation on the panel is disproportionate.
