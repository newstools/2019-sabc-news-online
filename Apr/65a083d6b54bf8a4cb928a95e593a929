An uneasy calm has returned to Alexandra north of Johannesburg following Wednesday’s community protest. However, there are conflicting views from community leaders on whether or not to continue with the protests on Thursday. While some leaders say the protest has been temporarily suspended, others say it will continue. Meanwhile, taxis are operating as usual and residents are going to work. Businesses have also been opened. AlexShutdown convener Sandile Mavundla says they’ve suspended the protest and their planned march to Sandton due to security concerns. “We were informed that when we will go to Sandton there will be private security that will be dealing with the people. And again we got information that the SAPS has sent intelligence so that people will be arrested. Then we said it’s better to suspend it for today (Thursday).” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/673092">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on video below:
