Suspended Senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocate Nomgcobo Jiba says the Mokgoro Enquiry has taken an emotional toll on her. The enquiry was established to look into Jiba and advocate Lawrence Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office. The two are awaiting communication from the Presidency regarding the findings of the enquiry. A leaked report by retired Constitutional Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, established that the pair is unfit to hold office in the NPA. The enquiry is reported to have said the two have compromised integrity, lack leadership and have poor ethical standards. Jiba spoke to SABC News. “It’s been a long journey, a very hectic journey, it’s been a painful journey. But I’m really happy that it has come this far and the enquiry is now finished. I will just have to say I leave it in the hands of the judges and her co-panelists in the enquiry itself.” Watch related videos:
