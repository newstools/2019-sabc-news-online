Traffic volumes are increasing on major routes in the Western Cape. More than 500 traffic officials will be deployed along highways throughout the weekend. Traffic volumes have spiked on the N1 at the Huguenot Tunnel outside Paarl and the N2 over Sir Lowry’s Pass outside Somerset West. The Western Cape Transport Department issued a warning earlier to motorists to adhere to the road rules or face the law. Buses and taxis from the Joe Gqabi Taxi Rank in Philippi are also being checked for roadworthiness before leaving on their journeys. Traffic volumes are also increasing on all major routes in Limpopo as churchgoers and holidaymakers make their way to their destinations for the Easter weekend. The N1 north towards Musina-Beitbridge and the R71 Moria-Polokwane are most affected. There’s also heavy traffic congestion in the Polokwane CBD. Meanwhile, five people have been killed on the Amajuba Pass outside Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal in a collision between two trucks and a minibus. KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, Zinhle Mngomezulu-Mali, says traffic volumes on the province’s roads have increased significantly since Thursday morning as holidaymakers make their way to their destinations for the Easter weekend. “Marianhill Plaza north bound is 1578 and south bound is 1402. Mooi Plaza north bound 790 and south bound 1280. Tongaat Plaza northbound 1145 and south bound is 1148. We are out and about to monitor the traffic patterns and we are working according to planned roadblocks for this Easter period. We want motorists to be extra cautious during this busy period,” says Mngomezulu-Mali. Watch related video below:
