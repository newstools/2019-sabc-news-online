A male nurse from a hospital in Springs in Ekurhuleni has been suspended with immediate effect after allegedly performing an illegal abortion on a 28-year-old woman. The nurse was apparently off duty at the time. Far East Rand Hospital CEO Constance Ndobe says the patient collapsed after she was given medication by the nurse. He later took her to hospital pretending he was her partner. Ndobe says criminal charges have been laid against the nurse and the case is also being referred to the South African Nursing Council for further investigation. “The patient was treated in the hospital and according to the nature of the damages, the patient had to be transferred to a higher level where she was operated on. She’s in a stable condition in ICU.”
