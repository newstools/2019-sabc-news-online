Former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss, Johan Booysen, is expected to take the stand at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Wednesday morning. He’ll be the second witness to testify about corruption and maladministration within the country’s law enforcement agencies. This after former Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride’s four days of testimony. Booysen used to head the Durban Organised Crime Unit known as the “Cato Manor” hit squad. It was accused of carrying out extra-judicial killings of 45 people. In 2012, the 12 member unit was arrested for murder, but Booysen was only charged with racketeering. It was recently found out that the reports of the killings were based on falsified evidence. Booysen told another Commission of Inquiry that he believed he was prosecuted because he was investigating a shady 2010 World Cup deal that involved former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Edward.
