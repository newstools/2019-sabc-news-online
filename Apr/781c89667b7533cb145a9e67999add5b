KwaZulu-Natal Acting Premier Sihle Zikalala says local government will do all it can to reach as many of the families that have been affected by the floods this week. Zikalala has been addressing the media in Durban and was responding to concerns raised by Umlazi residents that they were waiting for government to help them recover. Zikalala also confirmed that the death toll has risen to 70. “We must firstly improve the capacity on the ground. Secondly we must continue to study and educate communities not to build houses or reside in wetlands. This needs all stakeholders to work together.” Later on Thursday, Zikalala will visit Port Shepstone on the province’s south coast to assess the damage. Watch video below:
