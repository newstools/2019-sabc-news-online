The Office of the Presidency has confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa has received a recommendation from Justice Minister Michael Masutha to pardon King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. The king is serving 12 years at an East London prison for kidnapping, assault, arson and defeating the ends of justice. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko says they are considering recommendations by the Department of Justice whether King Dalindyebo should have his sentence remitted and be released, rather than receive a pardon. “President Ramaphosa has indeed received the recommendation from the Justice Department, in relation to a presidential pardon for his majesty, King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. The president is still applying his mind to the recommendation – and it comes after an exhaustive process by the Department of Justice which includes consultations with the family, and the King and those who were affected. Once a decision is made, it will be communicated to the King and other affected stakeholders.”
