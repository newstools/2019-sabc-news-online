The National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) will be in the Labour Court in Johannesburg on Thursday afternoon to defend their strike at Comair. Comair management is attempting to interdict the strike because they claim it is illegal. The strike follows the Commission of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) issuing a certificate of non-resolution after the parties failed to reach an agreement on salary discrepancy. The dispute relates to salary anomalies of 21 employees hired prior to 2009 being paid higher than the agreed applicable salary scale. The union and the company offered a once off payment as a goodwill gesture and to request the unions to move the outstanding basket of issues to the next round of salary negotiations. Comair says it will have a comprehensive contingency plan in place and intends to continue its daily operations during the Easter holiday. The carrier has also advised its customers to use its online check-in services or use the kiosks provided at airports.
