Nine people who were arrested on Sunday during violent clashes at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium have been granted bail of R500 each by the Bloemfontein Magistrateâ€™s Court. They faced a charge of public violence following chaos that erupted in an Absa Premiership match between Bloemfontein Celtic and Cape Town City. An unruly mob invaded the pitch and clashed with the police as they called for the removal of Celtic Chairperson Max Tshabalala. The accused include a 54-year-old woman and 8 men aged between 26 and 48. They will appear in court again on the 17 May.
