Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa has commended health workers in the province’s clinics for their commitment in serving their communities. Ramokgopa says the province remains top on the list when it comes to ideal clinics at 75%,  however she is not entirely happy with the figure. Ramokgopa has been addressing the media in NASREC, South of Johannesburg, on the state of affairs in her department. Ramokgopa says the department wants all clinics to be compliant, “ For those clinics that are platinum rated whenever I went there even unannounced visits they would actually pass the test of that rating. So many of our frontline workers are doing their best to provide quality health care. We have also introduced now the ideal hospitals norms and standards and appointed a provincial accreditation committee of independent experts and stakeholders. So we are pushing all our facilities to be compliant to norms and standards of a quality health system that is highly reliable.” Ramokgopa also spoke on governance issues saying there is progress in curbing wasteful expenditure. “The history of irregular expenditure was very high and the trend is a downward trend and part of the teams that we strengthened is finance team with the appointment of a CFO to help manage all these irregular expenditures throughout the health system,” says Ramokgopa.
