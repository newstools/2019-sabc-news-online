COSATU says it wants Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to retire. In his budget address earlier this year, Mboweni said that the public service was bloated and suggested that public servants who were 55 and above should opt for early retirement. Earlier this week, several media outlets reported that Mboweni had approached Ramos to head the process to unbundle Eskom. COSATU is against the process of unbundling the power utility. COSATU second deputy president Mike Shingange says: “Perhaps he has been too excited with his deployment that he thinks he can run the country the way he wants to. “We want to say to him we think his ideas at the helm of the economic cluster in particular the Reserve Bank and his cohorts have not taken this country forward.” He says Maria Ramos, Tito Mboweni, Trevor Manuel and a whole lot of them failed the country.
