The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) says it will hold its elective conference in May, in compliance with the Labour Relations Act. Amcu is under threat of being deregistered by the Labour Registrar over its failure to hold an elective conference within the specified time frame of five years. Briefing the media in Johannesburg, Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa says they will meet with the Registrar next Tuesday. Mathunjwa says there is no reason for their deregistration other than a politically-driven agenda by government and what he terms ‘white monopoly capital’. “The registrar of labour relations actions act wrote to us raising several points. One of these points was requesting us to state when we will have our next national congress. We undertook to conclude all processes and have a congress before the end of may 2019.” Watch video below for more on the story:
