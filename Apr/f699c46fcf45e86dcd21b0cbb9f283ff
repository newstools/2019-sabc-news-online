Johannesburg City Manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni says he doesn’t think it is barbaric to expect eleven families to use one chemical toilet. Lukhwareni was making submissions before a Human Rights Commission inquiry into the events leading up to this month’s violent service delivery protests in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The city manager was taken to task for saying eleven families to one toilet was not barbaric. He responded by highlighting that the toilets, although they are not ideal, are temporary measures. He also told the commission that eleven informal settlements inside Alexandra are about five years old. But he was at pains to explain how long people would have to wait for proper services.
