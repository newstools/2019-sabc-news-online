Tap water in Ermelo, in Mpumalanga, is smelly and murky. Residents are concerned about the quality of tap water. They complain of being sick after drinking water from their taps. Residents are worried of their health as the water appears dirty and has a strong smell. Many have been complaining of diarrhea. “We are drinking water that smells. The municipality doesn’t clean it. We had diarrhea and went to the clinic. Children have rash on their faces and bodies. I dont know, but they say we must vote. How can we vote if we are drinking rotting water?” says a resident, Selena Mnisi. Others are opting for bottled water, but it’s costly. “We now even buy water. Some don’t even have money to buy water … so, we need help. I can even show you my kids. They’re getting sick,” says another resident, Lundokhuhle Muneneva. Msukaligwa Municipality maintains the water is clean. They say it’s tested twice everyday. Municipality Mayor, Joseph Mkhaliphi, says, “We had load shedding a few weeks ago, it affected the levels of water in the reservoir. That surface picks up slage that goes into the water and it gives it some colouring and smell, but our officials are dealing (with it),” says Msukaligwa. Residents fear that the water is contaminated.
