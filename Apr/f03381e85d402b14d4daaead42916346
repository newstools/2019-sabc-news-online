The SABC says Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has made a loan guarantee request of R3.2b illion for the cash strapped public broadcaster. The newly appointed SABC board  was introduced to staff on Tuesday. SABC Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini says although it can still afford to pay employee salaries, the public broadcaster is battling to meet its other financial obligations. “We are grateful for the effort and the contribution by the minister. She’s helped put together a team made up of DOC, National Treasury and the SABC and there is great progress in that area. We are looking really positive to get financial help. She’s actually put a request for R3.2 billion to help us settle some of the outstanding debt that we have.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
