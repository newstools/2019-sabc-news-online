The South African Federation of Trade Union (SAFTU) says it is fully behind the Alexandra protests and has called on residents in other townships across the country to join the demonstrations. Alexandra residents embarked on sporadic protests last week over the mushrooming of shacks and illegal structures as well as service delivery failures. On Monday, a group of them marched to the City of Johannesburg’s Sandton regional office to hand over their memorandum. “SAFTU believes that the Alexandra township resembles other equal townships and residents that are going through a situation where you have systematic social exclusion and economic exclusion and as a result we believe their basic services as promised by those who led them being the ANC and DA have not been delivered. They have rightful reasons to stand up and protest and we support them for that particular cause,” says Moleko Phakedi, SAFTU Deputy General Secretary. Watch a related video below:
