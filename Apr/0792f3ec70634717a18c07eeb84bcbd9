The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will hear evidence from witnesses from law enforcement on Monday morning when it resumes. On Friday, former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana detailed the nature of the relationship which African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General and former Premier, Ace Magashule, allegedly had with the controversial Gupta family. Dukwana testified before the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that the Guptas were paying Magashule and Duduzane Zuma R1 million per month each. Dukwana said Tony Gupta made the revelation while he was trying to convince him to sign a letter which would have confirmed the appointment of a Gupta-affiliated company to handle two major development contracts in the Free State. “He was saying, we will give R2 million but when I refused he said you know, you can trust me, ask brother Ace and brother Duduzane. I drive to Magashule’s place and I give him his million and I give Duduzane his million and I get my million. He then said isn’t it so? Ace said yes and Duduzane agreed. I was like, he does not know me. He’s now giving me this information about the people that he’s working with,” says Dukwana. Watch a related video below:
