The South African Broadcasting Corporation‘s (SABC) crew has been robbed in Alexandra township, east Johannesburg following a near hijacking. The crew comprising Natasha Phiri and Sbu Mcedane were accosted by unidentified men who made off with their camera. This is the second incident that has befallen the public broadcaster’s crew, with journalist Maagegetla Mohabe last week being harassed by a resident while on air. The crew has opened a case with the Alexandra police. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police.  The question of journalist’s safety is once again on the spotlight. Is this becoming a trend? Executive director of the South African National Editors Forum (SANEF), Kate Skinner explains:  The stolen camera is the same model as the one below. Residents are urged to contact Alexandra police with any information.
