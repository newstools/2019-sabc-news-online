Eight people have been arrested after being found in possession of stolen gadgets, including cellphones and laptops at Mayville in Durban. KwaZulu-Natal Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the eight will also likely be linked with other burglary incidents in and around Durban. Mbhele says the suspects are expected to appear in court on Tuesday. “Eight suspects aged between 22 and 40 were arrested for a number of burglary cases in communities in Mayville and surrounding. They were found in possession of flat screens, cellphones and laptops. They were all charged for possession of suspected stolen property and housebreaking. They will all appear in the Durban Magistrates court possibly on Tuesday,” says Mbhele. Meanwhile,  police in KwaZulu-Natal have remained mum on the spade of robberies and break-ins at the KwaMashu Police Station north of Durban. The township is notorious for serious crimes such as armed robberies and killings. Now the local police station has been a victim of strings of crime in the past two years targeting dockets and fire-arms.
