The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State has denied claims that it is s been captured by party’s secretary general, Ace Magashule. Magashule is a former Free State premier and has served as the ANC provincial chairperson for more than 20 years. Former Mangaung Metro mayor, Playfair Morule denies that his family business unduly benefited during Ace Magashule’s era in the Free State. He says allegations made in the “Gangster State” are misleading and he’s threatened to sue the author. He says on the contrary, the family business lost lucrative government deals and blames no one for that. “This company put down 15 foundations which were never paid and the company that laid down those foundations went to court and won and the Free State government never honoured the payment to date and as a result of non-payment that company was put out of business,” says Morule. Morule who’s also former SA High Commissioner to India says he is willing to appear before the State Capture Commission while former Free State ANC treasurer and long-serving MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana, has already appeared before the Commission. “I’m hereby reaching out to the former premier, my comrade and my secretary general Ace Magashule to live up to his words because he’s on record saying that should the need arise he’s prepared to appear before the Zondo commission,” says Morule. Morule has also called on Magashule to appear before the State Capture Commission. The ANC has rejected claims of being captured by Magashule and that the party has relied on the collective decision making. “In our view this is just an excitement to continue to smear the calibre of a leader of the ANC of comrade Ace Magashule and the ANC in the province vehemently disagrees with that narrative and that agenda,” says Free State ANC spokesperson, Thabo Meeko. Meanwhile, investigative journalist, Pieter-Louis Myburgh, is not budging. He says he’s got documentary evidence to back his claims. WATCH BELOW:
