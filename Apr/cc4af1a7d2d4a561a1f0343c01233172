Some of the Northern Cape residents believe it’s important to celebrate freedom on a daily basis instead of waiting for 27 April. Encouraging residents not to forget where they come from, the Northern Cape government sent out a stern message to residents at the Freedom Day commemoration in Warrenton, to value their freedom. The government also encouraged people to continue celebrating it every day. Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba, Sports Arts and Culture MEC, says that freedom is for everyone. “It is not a freedom of a particular race, it’s not a freedom of particular individuals; it is a freedom for all of you. All South Africans; black and white, educated and not educated. So we need to continue celebrating the freedom.” Resident, Kgomotso Setshogela, says that she is free to move around as opposed to before 1994. “I can remember 1994, my first time being at a multi-racial school. Before that, I wasn’t exposed to such freedom. But now today I can freely move around South Africa without being asked questions; where and what am I doing at a certain time or place. Freedom, for me, means being able to be me. I’m very free, I can go into any shop without being looked down on due to the colour of my skin, so for me South Africa is free.” WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
