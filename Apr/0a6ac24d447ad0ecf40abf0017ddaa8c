African National Congress (ANC) Spokesperson Dakota Legoete says there is no place for the old flag in a democratic South Africa. Legoete is attending the Equality Court hearing where the Nelson Mandela Foundation is seeking for the gratuitous display of the apartheid flag to be declared hate speech. Lobby group AfriForum is opposing the application, citing freedom of expression. The Foundation’s Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi has accused AfriForum of longing for the apartheid system which the flag represents. Judgement has been reserved in the Equality Court. Legoete says it is completely unreasonable to fight for the flag.  “It will be rubbing salt in the wounds of millions of South Africans, who more than 4 000 of them were hanged in Kgosi Mampuru Prison. “More than 200 000 of them are displaced even today. I think it will be very wrong that a government which was declared, including its symbol, as a crime against humanity to find expression 25 years later into our democracy.”  Click video below for more on the story:
