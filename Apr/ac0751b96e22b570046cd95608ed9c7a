KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Willies Mchunu, has declared this coming Thursday a provincial day of mourning for the victims of the floods that ravaged the Durban Metro and other parts of the province. He’s announced that the official death toll now stands at 70, with two more people still missing in Durban. Mchunu says infrastructure damage in the province is currently estimated at R1.1 billion. In eThekwini, more than 1400 people were displaced and about 200 homes damaged. Mchunu says a memorial service will be held in Durban on the day of mourning. “We invite all citizens, interfaith formations and all sectors of society to participate in this day of prayer and mourning. The main event will take place at Curries Fountain Sports Field this coming Thursday from 9am, more details will be announced in due course,” says Mchunu. Meanwhile, Mchunu has condemned some employees at the eThekwini water department for embarking on a strike, calling it totally immoral. He says it is unacceptable that people have been left without water, while the province is still reeling from the disaster. Mchunu says he has appointed Human Settlements MEC, Ravi Pillay, to head a task team to negotiate with the striking workers. “Water is an essential service that cannot be used as a bargaining chip against the people. It is the view of the provincial government that this stride when our province is in such a disaster situation can be described in no other terms than that this is totally immoral,” says Mchunu.
