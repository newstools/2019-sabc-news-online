The five month strikeÂ by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) at Sibanye-Stillwater has ended after the two parties reached an agreement.  As part of the agreement, Amcu has committed to signing the 2018 three-year wage agreement previously signed with National Union of Mineworkers, Solidarity and UASA in respect of wages and conditions of service for the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2021. Sibanye-Stillwater has agreed to a R4 000 payment for all employees at its gold operations in the form of cash or a voucher to alleviate hardship. It has also offered a cash advance of R5 000 upon request of the employees which will be repayable over a 12 month period and will also assist with debt consolidation and counselling. The mine will also provide transport for employees to return to work.
