The bail application of three men accused of the murder of former ANC Youth League Secretary-General Sindiso Magaqa will resume on Tuesday at the Umzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court in KwaZulu-Natal. The matter was postponed on Monday after the magistrate presiding over the case was unavailable. The Umzimkhulu Magistrates’ Court is expected to hear the bail application of three men accused of killing Magaqa. Sibonelo Myeza, Mbulelo Mpofana and Mlungisi Ncalane are the three remaining accused in this murder case. The three were charged along with Harry Gwala district Municipality mayor Mluleki Ndobe and Umzimkhulu municipal manager Zweliphansi Skhosana. The charges against Ndobe and Skhosana have been provisionally withdrawn. The three also face two counts of attempted murder. According to the charge sheet, the second and third counts relate to the attempted murder of Jabulile Msiya and Nontsikelelo Mafa on July 13 2017, the same day Magaqa was gunned.
