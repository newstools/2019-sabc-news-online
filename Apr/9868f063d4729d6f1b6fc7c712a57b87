The Democratic Alliance claims the inauguration of the President on May 25th will cost a R120 million. This is the number the party says it got after guarantees that event, as well as the opening session of the 6th Parliament would come at a reduced budget. In South Africa, traditionally, inaugurations have been held at the Union Buildings. This time, it will be hosted at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Tshwane, on the 25th of May. The DA says municipalities which are already cash-strapped will be impacted by this. DA Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen, says municipalities have also been instructed by the government to pay for the transport and breakfast of community members. Steenhuisen says in the country’s current financial climate, the cost should not be allowed. “R120-million is excessive. You can probably get away with something like this for R3 million if you on a shoestring budget, which I believe our current fiscal situation demands. Every one cent that is spent on this operation – that’s one rand that could’ve gone to clinics, hospitals, service, improving grants, improving deliverable items. We need to be careful with every rand we spend right now.”   The Presidency is yet to comment on the matter.
