Gauteng Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation MEC Faith Mazibuko is to appear before the Human Rights Commission on Tuesday, to answer to her utterances wherein she berates her executive managers for failure to deliver sports facilities last month. In an audio recording, Mazibuko is heard shouting at the two managers and telling them she wanted to use the facilities known as Combi courts to campaign for elections. The utterances that the HRC wants MEC Mazibuko to account for is: “I empower you, you are not empowerable. Which other department has an Indian that is a CFO? Which department has an HOD that is a ‘mlungu’? Ayikho.” Acting Head of Legal Services at the commission Buang Jones says they’ve received several complaints from the public in which they describe the MEC’s comments as objectionable and demeaning to the two women. “The commission has therefore invited MEC Mazibuko to appear before it to confirm whether the comments attributed to her were in violation of the rights enshrined in the Constitution,” says Jones. Mazibuko has since apologised. Watch the video below for related news:
