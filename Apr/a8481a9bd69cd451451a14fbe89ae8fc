The Johannesburg Metro Police department is investigating an incident of looting at a retail outlet in Hillbrow allegedly by a group of students on Monday. This happened after a march by students organised by student organisation Cosas. Hundreds of students marched to the ANC headquarters Luthuli house in central Johannesburg. They were demanding action to be taken including against violence in school and poor infrastructure. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minaar says: “Students who were returning home after a march in the Johannesburg CBD looted the Spar shop in Hillbrow. There were also individuals with criminal intent who joined in with the looting. This incident will be investigated and any video footage of inside and outside the shop will be used.” “Anyone found responsible for this looting will have to be charged criminally,” adds Minaar.
