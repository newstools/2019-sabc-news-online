The Passenger Rail Agency, Prasa, has suspended its Head of Security in the Western Cape, Ernest Hendricks, along with a security company following the torching of two trains at Cape Town Station during the Easter Weekend. Twelve carriages were torched causing damage worth R33 million. A suspect has appeared in court after he was allegedly spotted on the scene on surveillance cameras. Prasa’s Group Chief Strategy Officer, Sipho Sithole, says the suspensions are not meant to cast blame on Hendricks and the security company. He says they will allow for an investigation into the incident to be carried out by an independent body. “We have a security company deployed at Cape Town Train Station. So, we do not expect any security lapse or any compromising of our safety and security interventions …” says Sithole.
