African National Congress (ANC) National Spokesperson Pule Mabe says he underwent counselling as recommended by the party’s grievance panel after he was cleared of sexual harassment charges. Mabe returned to his office on Monday after he took extended leave. He attended the special National Executive Committee meeting in Irene outside Pretoria. However, Mabe is not a free man, yet as the woman who has accused him of sexual harassment, Kgoerano Kekana, has opened a police case against him. Mabe says: “I had asked for my leave to be extended because I had exams and I had to attend to few other issues that I had advised the organisation that required my attention. There was an ANC process that cleared me against all of those allegations that were brought up. I asked to be recused from my duties. I dealt with those by February we had concluded with that. The grievance panel subsequently issued its own report. There were certain recommendations made by the grievance panel which required I attend too. I finished that process which was more a counselling process.” Watch the video below for related news:
