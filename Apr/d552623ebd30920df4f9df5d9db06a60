Lack of patience by motorists has been attributed to most of the crashes on Mpumalanga roads since the beginning of the Easter weekend. Close to 30 crashes have been reported and 11 lives have been lost. Department of Community Safety Security and Liaison spokesperson Moeti Mmusi says most of the crashes are head-on collisions. He says fatigue cannot be ruled out. Mmusi has urged drivers to rest when tired or alternate driving if possible. “We have noticed that some of these deadly crashes are head-on collisions, which usually occur when people are impatient with one another, we are therefore appealing with them to be patient and not overtake where it’s not allowed to do so or dangerously or where the weather conditions are not favourable. They should also try to adjust their driving in line with those conditions so that everyone arrives safe,” says Mmusi. Meanwhile, two people have died and five others injured after a vehicle they were travelling in rolled over on the Boy Lowe Road in Vereeniging, south of Johannesburg on Saturday morning. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring says when paramedics arrived on the scene, they found a light motor vehicle lying on its roof in the middle of the road. Meiring says a man was found lying inside the vehicle, while six others were found scattered outside the vehicle. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that the man inside the vehicle, as well as a woman,  found lying outside the vehicle a few metres away, had sustained numerous fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead. Five other patients were assessed, their injuries ranging from minor to moderate. The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further care. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.” Click below for more on traffic:
