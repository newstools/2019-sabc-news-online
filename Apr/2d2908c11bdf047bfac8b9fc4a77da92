A senior manager at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), Pamela Phala has started to testimony before the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the PIC in Pretoria. The inquiry was supposed to wrap up last week but President Cyril Ramaphosa granted the chairperson Justice Lex Mpati a four-month extension. Phala says she is testifying because she has been silenced for too long. “After long consideration, I have decided to approach the commission. I have listened with fascination of how my character has been portrayed as both the victim as well as a very rude type of personality on the one hand. I have been spied on by the top two within the company, but nothing seems to have happened to me. One of the employees has referred to me as the go to person when it comes to the labour matters at the PIC involving general employees and therefore some sort of terminator,” says Phala.
