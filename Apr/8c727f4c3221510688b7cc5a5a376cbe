The Department of Water and Sanitation is embarking on plans to restore its management and finances. The minister has appointed two entities to help root out corruption. It wants to restore the integrity of its infrastructure management projects. The department and its partners briefed the media in Pretoria on a turnaround strategy on Tuesday. The Department of Water and Sanitation is on a path to restore leadership. The minister says poor management and prolonged corruption put the country’s water infrastructure systems in jeopardy. He has tasked the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority and the Development Bank of South Africa, to solve the problem. The entities will help manage among others, the De Hoop and Giyani water projects. The minister blames blind management for the ongoing crises. “Everyone is to blame and, including myself. I was part of government,” says Minister Gugile Nkwinti. Asked by reporter Patricia Visagie, if he should not be held accountable instead of being tasked to fix the mess, Nkwinti responded, “Patricia’s question is political. We are here because the majority put us here, and now we are self-correcting. We made mistakes and we are fixing the problem now. That’s why we are embarking on this plan.” The department confirmed that various probes are underway to enforce accountability. Investigations by the SUI and disciplinary hearings are just some of them. The minister emphasised that he hopes that the investigations will shed light on who exactly must be held accountable and take the fall for the woes at water and sanitation.
