Mpumalanga-based property development company Halls Properties is under the spotlight. Retired ex workers say the company’s exit packages are incomplete. They claim Halls promised 440 of them land and houses as part of their retirement, but only about 123 people benefited. The pensioners embarked on a peaceful march against their former employer in Mbombela. They say the company is yet to complete its undertaking to build them houses as part of an exit package. “We want Halls Properties to deliver on its promises. Many of the elderly people are suffering now. 440 people were supposed to benefit, but only 123 got what was promised,” says Phumulani Residents Association’s Mohammed Mnisi. Even those who benefited say they are not happy with the relocation that came with getting houses. They’ve added that the houses built for them are too small and there’s also no grazing land for their livestock. Halls Properties management says it’s looking into the matter. “We will attend to the issues raised here. Some of them are new, but there are records. We will go back to those records and see what can be done,” says Halls Properties Managing Director, David Mabunda. The disgruntled pensioners have given Halls Properties seven days to respond to the demands.
