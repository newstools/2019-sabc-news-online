Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will deliver his decision on whether or not former South African Revenue Service (SARS) boss, Tom Moyane, can cross examine Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Moyane applied to the State Capture Commission of Inquiry to cross examine Gordhan on his version of how Moyane was appointed as SARS Commissioner. In March Monyane argued in his application that the right to confront one’s accuser was not only fair but just. Gordhan opposed the application saying the inquiry shouldn’t allow the cross examination because Moyane was disgruntled and wanted a public platform to denigrate him. Meanwhile, former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) boss, Robert McBride is set to continue giving evidence on Tuesday. The Inquiry’s legal team says it’s identifying and consulting other witnesses believed to have work within law enforcement agencies that will be called to testify in the next few weeks.
