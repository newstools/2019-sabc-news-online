The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants President Cyril Ramaphosa’s declaration of interests since his election as president in 2018, to be made public. The party has written to the Secretary of Cabinet, Cassius Lubisi, requesting this information. The DA says it believes that there appears to be a direct conflict of interest on the President’s part relating to his son whom it believes may have unduly benefited from the family connection. It says if the President has failed to disclose any conflict of interest as it relates to his son, then the Public Protector must investigate whether he has breached the Executive Ethics Act. The opposition party’s interest in the President’s financial affairs stems from allegations that Andile Ramaphosa is in business with a Chinese energy company that attempted to secure a R400 million kickback from an Eskom loan in January 2018. He has also admitted to receiving money from BOSASA to secure projects for the company. Listen to Mmusi Maimane’s statement: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/672635">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
