Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says former British colonies such as Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa are still battling with the impact of colonialism on the issue of land. He has also lambasted the Western Power who have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe. Museveni attended the Zimbabwe Trade Fair in Bulawayo. He used his visit to the the Trade fair to call for improved relations at a time when relations between Uganda and Rwanda are frosty. Museveni called on African countries to work together. “In the 60s Africans were divided but that has changed and Africa must be united,” says Museveni. Rwanda and Uganda are embroiled in a spat. They accuse each other of meddling in the internal affairs of each other. Watch video below:
