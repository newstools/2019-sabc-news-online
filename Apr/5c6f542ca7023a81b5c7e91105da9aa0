Former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID)  boss Robert McBride says one of his former subordinates was told to implicate him in wrongdoing in exchange for getting his job back. McBride, who testified before the State Capture Commission of Inquiry on Monday, says IPID investigator Innocent Khuba was approached by a Hawks official telling him to write a false statement against McBride so he can be reinstated. Khuba was fired in 2015 after signing a document that cleared McBride of wrongdoing. McBride produced a recording of the Hawks official offering Khuba the deal which was allegedly an instruction from a general. McBride says he understood this to be an instruction by former Hawks boss, Berning Ntlemeza. Watch te full video below for more on the story:
