Axed South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Chief Operations Officer, Chris Maroleng (also known as Chris Maroleni), says he intends taking the termination of his contract with the public broadcaster  to the courts. The SABC earlier said it was terminating Maroleng’s contract with immediate effect. He had been found guilty of breaching his fiduciary duties and also of negligence following a disciplinary hearing earlier in April. Maroleng says he is consulting his lawyers. “I’m quite devastated by the reconstituted Board’s decision to terminate my contract following the recommendations (of) a disciplinary hearing. What we’ll be doing is taking advice from my legal council and ultimately will then appeal the decision on the basis that I think it has been a harsh sanction that does not warrant a dismissal.” Maroleng admits that he may have made some missteps at the public broadcaster. “Ultimately, if I did do anything bad, it was really exhibit what I might describe as poor judgement in some of my decisions at the SABC, which have led to the disciplinary process unfolding.”
