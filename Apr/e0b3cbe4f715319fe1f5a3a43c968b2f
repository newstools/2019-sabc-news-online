The SABC Board says its decision to dismiss its Chief Operations Officer, Chris Maroleng, is a step towards restoring stability and bringing order in the public broadcaster. The Public Broadcaster announced that the Board resolved to dismiss Maroleng with immediate effect after he was found guilty on three charges. Maroleng has said he will be challenging his dismissal. Maroleng, says he intends taking the termination of his contract with the public broadcaster to the courts.  Maroleng says he’s consulting his lawyers. “I’m quite devastated by the reconstituted board’s decision to terminate my contract following the recommendations of a disciplinary hearing. What we’ll be doing is taking advice from my legal counsel and ultimately will then appeal the decision on the basis that I think it has been a harsh sanction that does not warrant a dismissal.” SABC Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini explains: “It’s within his right to seek whatever kind of help or take any other option that’s available to him legally. It is important for us as the board to bring back stability in this organisation and it starts by driving consequences management and bringing order and dealing with all irregularities and dealing with all instances where basically there’s disregard of policies in our own procedures and we must be seen to be doing the right thing and to restore the credibility and to get our people excited that the is future for the SABC and it starts by us cleaning house.” WATCH BONGUMUSA MAKHATHINI BELOW:
