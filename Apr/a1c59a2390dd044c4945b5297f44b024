The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is expected to hear testimony from former Independent Police Investigative Directorate chief, Robert McBride. He will implicate at least 30 people in his evidence, some of those hold high office in government.

McBride was set down to give his testimony earlier this year, but it was postponed to allow for those implicated by him a chance to respond to the allegations. Click on video below:
