A 39-year-old woman drowned at Labane village near Mbizana. Another one was swept away by floods while crossing Mdumbi River near Ngqeleni. The first flood victim was a 12-year-old girl who was swept away by flood waters near KwaBhaca. Heavy rains and flooding have ravaged places such as Ngqeleni, Mbizana, Lusikisiki, Qumbu and Port St Johns. More than 300 people have been evacuated from their homes in Port St Johns. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) rescue team and other rescue organisations are assisting. Meanwhile, the Eastern Cape Education Department has urged school governing bodies (SGB) and principals to suspend academic activities in areas that are affected by heavy rains until weather patterns change for the better. Heavy rains and flooding continue to ravage the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. At least 32 people have died in the flooding in KZN. The weather is expected to start clearing from Thursday. The Eastern Cape Education Department says they want to ensure that learners and teachers donâ€™t cross flooded rivers. Education spokesperson Loyiso Pulumani says this step has been taken in the best interests of the learners and teachers. Click on the video below:
