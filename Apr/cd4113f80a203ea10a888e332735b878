Former Independent Police Directorate for Investigation (IPID) boss, Robert McBride, says there was an irregular restructuring of staff positions in an effort to make IPID dysfunctional. Testifying at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg, he says specialists like the Chief Financial Officer would be transferred to head investigation in another province. McBride has added that this was to weaken the power of IPID in order to cover up crime and corruption within the police service. He says key investigations were stagnated due to the reshuffling of officials. McBride has also added that he was concerned about how one of the high-profile cases was handled when he joined IPID. He says the Zimbabwean rendition case that resulted in the dismissal of Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya was irregularly investigated by the Crime Intelligence Unit. Sibiya, along with his former boss Anwa Dramat, was alleged to have illegally deported Zimbabwean suspects to their country. McBride says that it was shocking since those IPID investigators should have handled the matter. Click video below for more on the story:
