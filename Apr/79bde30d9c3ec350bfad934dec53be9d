President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Tuesday that France would rebuild the fire-devastated Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, saying he hoped the work would be done in five years and the French people would pull together to repair their national symbol. Macron devoted a brief prime-time televised address to Monday’s catastrophic blaze in the heart of the capital, again postponing planned remarks on his response to months of anti-government protests. “We will rebuild Notre-Dame even more beautifully and I want it to be completed in five years, we can do it,” Macron said. “It is up to us to convert this disaster into an opportunity to come together, having deeply reflected on what we have been and what we have to be and become better than we are. It is up to us to find the thread of our national project.” “This is not a time for politics,””added Macron, who had cancelled a speech planned on Monday evening on the response to the “yellow vest” protests. He visited the site of the fire late on Monday and promised then to rebuild the cathedral, parts of which date to the 12th century. The cathedral spire was destroyed and its roof gutted but the bell towers were still standing and many valuable art works were saved after more than 400 firemen worked to contain the blaze, finally quelling it 14 hours after it began.
