The bail application of controversial pastor, James Thobakgale, will continue in the Seshego Magistrate’s Court in Polokwane, Limpopo, on Monday. He has been charged with five counts of rape, four of assault and one of fraud. The case has been postponed numerous times since Thobakgale’s arrest in February. Five other church leaders arrested for fraud and assault have been released on bail. Community members, who are against Thobakgale being released on bail, says, “This man really has terrorised the community in general. What is alleged that he is doing to the community is really not on. Those who do not come to church if they supposed to come he will beat them. In 2012 there were cases of three young women in his church, it was alleged that he raped them. It’s ranging from abuse to the extent of sexual abuse and ends up that communities are withdrawing cases. “He is buying the families to withdraw cases and so on. We are concerned about this man, we can’t tolerate this thing,” added another community member.
