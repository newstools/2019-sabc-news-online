Ground-breaking research that has led to two HIV positive patients going into remission in London and Berlin in the past few years could be expanded to Africa. World renowned HIV/AIDS expert Prof Ravi Gupta who has been instrumental in the research that led to the two patients going into remission after stem cell transplantation spoke to the media in Durban. “The cancer field uses things like 5 year remission, so we are going be cautious with our individuals. It will be two years in September since he stopped treatment of HIV treatment, that is why we use the word remission rather than the word cure as it increases expectations a lot and it is also impossible to prove cure. We would like especially to replicate the thing like the London patients in Africa, which will be fantastic. We have some tools that we can really deploy the team to control the epidemic.” <a href="https://iono.fm/e/678053">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
