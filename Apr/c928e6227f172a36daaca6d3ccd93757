Government says it will continue to closely monitor the situation in Sudan and hopes for a speedy resolution to the crisis in the country. Sudanese leader Omar Al Bashir has been ousted from power and a military council has taken over governing the country for a transitional period of two years. The developments follow months of violent protests against Al Bashir’s thirty years in power. He is also facing charges at the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes. International Relations Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, addressed the situation in Sudan whilst delivering the Dr Phyllis Naidoo memorial lecture in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday night.   “What we do know is that the military has taken over, it has declared the state of emergency and Al Bashir has been put in detention. We are hoping that there can be some speedy resolution to this so that we can get Sudan back under civilian rule.” Sisulu added: “We are working very hard to make sure that we can have a peaceful Africa and any disturbance worries us very much, but if it [is] the will of the people of Sudan we will abide by it”
