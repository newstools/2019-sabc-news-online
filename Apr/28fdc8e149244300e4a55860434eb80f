South Africans enjoy their braais and when the opportunity to buy into a Chesa Nyama franchise arose, many invested into it. But distraught franchisees allege this business opportunity only favoured the franchise company and its previous owners, and as a result, they have nothing to show for it. Former franchisees of Chesa Nyama, who entered into agreements with the company and its then-parent company GoldBrands Investments Limited, allege their deals turned sour because of dubious business practices that benefitted the owners at the time. Chesa Nyama has since been sold. However, disgruntled franchisees claim they suffered major financial losses, had to voluntarily pull out of the agreements and were forced to move out of the premises they were renting. They are now picking up the pieces. This week SABC’s Special Assignment investigates allegations surrounding the franchise Chesa Nyama.
