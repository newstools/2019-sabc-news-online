Former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) Head, Robert McBride will continue giving evidence at the State Capture Inquiry in Johannesburg on Friday morning. On Thursday, McBride told the Commission that former Police Minister Nathi NhlekoÂ  misrepresented a IPID report to get rid of a Hawks boss. He says that the report that he submitted to Nhleko did not recommend the prosecution of former Hawks head, Anwar Dramat. However in 2014, Nhleko suspended Dramat and said it was based on an IPID report. Click link for Live stream
