Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, says Eskom has no intentions of implementing load shedding throughout winter or at most will have 26 days of Stage One load shedding until the end of August. Gordhan was addressing the media at Lethabo Power Station in the Free State. The power utility is battling to deal with major financial and operational challenges that resulted in the recent implementation of load shedding. “For one reason or another the unplanned outages go above 9500. And that instance, according to the planning that has been undertaken by Eskom, a maximum of 26 days of only stage one load shedding will occur throughout this whole five month period. Today was day one of the 26 days by the way, so it’s 25 days and there’s no load shedding today. So hopefully we can sustain the good news,” says Gordhan. Eskom board chairperson Jabu Mabuza says coal stockpiles have improved. The power utility says it will continue to fix design problems at the Medupi and Kusile power stations.
