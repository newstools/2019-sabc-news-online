The death toll following the torrential rain that caused flooding in the Eastern Cape has risen to 10 after a person drowned in the Hluleka river near Ngqeleni. Four of the victims were school children, while a toddler also drowned in a water filled ditch in Port Elizabeth. Most of the victims died while trying to cross flooded rivers while two schoolboys drowned while swimming in a dam. Counselling will be provided this week to the family of the missing learner and fellow learners. The Department of Education also provided counseling to the schools that were affected by deaths. The flooding also indirectly led to an 11th death when a man collapsed and died when he had to watch helplessly as his home collapsed due to the heavy rains. Watch video below:
