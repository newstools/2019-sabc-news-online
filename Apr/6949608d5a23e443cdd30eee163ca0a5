Traffic has began to decrease on the N1 and N4 highways around Pretoria leading to Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Ten people have been killed on Gauteng’s roads since Thursday. On Friday morning a cyclist was killed and others injured in a hit and run accident in Centurion south of Pretoria.  Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson, Isaac Mahamba,  says about 1800 cars passed through the Phumulani Toll Plaza just before midday. “At this stage as you correctly mentioned it has began to ease, there’s few vehicles on the roads. Most of the holiday makers are already on the other side of the north. It will start again picking up on Monday or Sunday. But we will continue to monitor all these area like it’s not only this N1. Moloto road is the road that we are keeping an eye on also.”
