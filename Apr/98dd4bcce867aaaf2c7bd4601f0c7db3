The Labour Court in Johannesburg has reserved judgment on Comair‘s application to interdict the strike of workers affiliated to National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa). The airline says the strike has been interdicted until a judgment is handed down and that striking workers will be required to return to work in the meantime. Comair says the strike that started a short while ago has not had a direct impact on its operations. Wrenelle Stander the executive director of Comair’s  airline division says: “The strike got on around one and at that time we deployed volunteer staff to support the daily operations and that continued without any interruptions and the judgment is being reserved and the strike has been interdicted until the judgment is handed down.” Meanwhile, striking Comair workers are picketing outside the OR Tambo International Airport. There is a heavy police presence around the airport. Comair has advised its passengers to check in online. The company says contingency plans are in place for passengers travelling over the Easter Weekend. WATCH BELOW:
