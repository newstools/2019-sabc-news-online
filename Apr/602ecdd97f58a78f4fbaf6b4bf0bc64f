The younger brother of a Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student killed in 2016 during the Fees Must Fall protests has on Friday graduated with a Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree. Kevin Phehla is the first recipient of the Lesedi Benjamin Phehla Scholarship. The Scholarship was named after his late brother. A dream come true for Kevin Phehla after his brother Benjamin died fighting for free education at the Tshwane University of Technology. To honour Lesedi Benjamin Phehla, TUT created a scholarship named after him. Kevin Phehla says:”I would not have made it to this day; I would not have got a chance to achieve this particular qualification. That young man played a critical role in assisting the family. As his brother I will ensure to continue where he left.” His family is ecstatic for the opportunity. Mother Leah Phehla says:”I am grateful and happy as I see the child graduating in the midst of what has happened to Benjamin, its pain and happiness.” TUT says Benjamin Phehla’s death could not go unrecognised. TUT Spokesperson Willa De Rutter says:”The University thought it would be prudent to start this scholarship either for his siblings or family member to Benjamin.” Phehla looks forward to raising the family flag.
