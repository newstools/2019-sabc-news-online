Authorities are looking for two cows that made a run for it after the truck transporting them overturned on the M1 south between Corlett and Grayston Drives in Sandton, north of Johannesburg.  There’ve been no reported injuries. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar has advised motorists to avoid that part of the highway until the accident scene has been cleared. “A truck which was drawing a trailer transporting cows, four of the cows have been regrouped but two cows have ran off down the embankment. There is also a double cab involved in the accident and obstructing the road, M1 north and south, motorists are requested to look out for the accident scene.”
