Parents and their children have shut down Oakdale high school in Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg. They are demanding upgrades to the school arguing it’s not a conducive environment for learning. The school has become a scene of protesting parents and learners burning tyres. It’s already two weeks into the new academic term, but none of the pupils have seen the inside of a classroom. Parents have joined forces with their children, demanding a new school. They say nothing has been done to improve the school since its establishment 25 years ago. They also say the dilapidated condition of the school makes it vulnerable to vandalism. SGB chairperson, Jacqueline Duarte Schutte says, “The school’s matric class of 2019 says that it has been a difficult journey. Since grade 8 from the classrooms to the sporting facilities, there’s little to encourage learning.” The Gauteng Education department has promised to change the situation. It says there are plans to procure the removal of mobile classes and renovating some of the classrooms. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “We are aware of the situation and we have started getting a service provider to remove mobile classrooms and fix the roofs. We also appeal to community to allow the children to go back to school.” Gauteng’s aging school infrastructure was thrown under the spotlight following the death of four learners at Hoërskool Driehoek. Another school in Pretoria West has also reported unstable school infrastructure. Watch related video below for more on the story:
