International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has thanked local and international donors who have contributed aid to the victims of the recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal. Over a 1000 people have been displaced due to the floods. Sisulu was speaking during a hand over ceremony of emergency relief from the Chinese diaspora in South Africa on Friday. Chinese nationals have contributed over R1 million worth of humanitarian aid. Sisulu says there is no end to kindness. She says: “There’s no end to kindness. Kindness is an inexhaustible nature of human beings and our international community does have that kind of unending gift.” “We have been to Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi dealing with the aftermath of Idai,  but we didn’t expect that it will happen to us. Somehow our focus was on the other matter. Somehow it struck us overnight without any preparation, without any alert system, indicating that somehow we would be struck by this disaster.” The eThekwini Municipality estimates that the interim cost of damage caused by the recent floods is around R658 million. Assessments have been done by various municipal departments. Related Video
