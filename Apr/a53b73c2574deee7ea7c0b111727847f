University of Western Cape academic, Sean Davison‘s case will return to the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. He is charged with pre-meditated murder. It’s alleged that Davison, who is an advocate of assisted suicide, helped his friend, 43-year-old doctor Anrich Burger to die in a Cape Town hotel room in 2013 after he had become a quadriplegic after a car crash. Davison was again arrested in September 2017 in connection with another alleged assisted suicide. He allegedly helped Justin Varian, who had motor neuron disease, commit suicide in a Cape Town apartment by asphyxiation. The incident took place in 2015. Davison was also involved in his mother’s assisted suicide in New Zealand in 2011 and sentenced to five months house arrest. He is currently out on bail of R20 000.
