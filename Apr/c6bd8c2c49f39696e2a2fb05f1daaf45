The fate of SABC Chief Operating Officer, Chris Maroleng, is in the hands of the public broadcaster’s newly appointed board. Disciplinary processes were initiated against Maroleng late last year. Following these processes, the City Press newspaper says Maroleng was found guilty of three charges which qualify for dismissal. The newspaper states that “Maroleng faced charges ranging from gross negligence to breach of fiduciary duty. He was found guilty of approving a monthly acting allowance of R15 000 for an employee despite a written Human Resources decision to the contrary.” The paper further states that “the two other charges relate to Maroleng’s alleged protection of former Acting Group Executive for Sports, Marcia Mahlalela, who resigned from the SABC before facing a disciplinary hearing of her own relating to the process followed in the appointment of sports broadcaster Robert Marawa”. SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu says the recommendations and findings of the disciplinary hearing have been handed over to the Board for a decision. She says: “The SABC can confirm that a disciplinary hearing was held against the COO. The recommendations of the disciplinary committee will be handed over to the new Board when they come into office. The SABC will not discuss the details of the DC and has no further comment on the matter at this stage.” “We remain committed to ensuring sound governance irrespective of one’s position within the corporation,” adds Mthembu. The newspaper quotes Maroleng’s lawyer Itayi Gwaunza as saying his client “would make his submission tomorrow and depending on the outcome will then decide on a way forward”.
