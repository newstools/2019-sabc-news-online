The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is expected to hear testimony from former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert McBride. The commission was set to hear his testimony on Monday, but it was postponed because the commissionâ€™s legal team failed to notify the people he has implicated. They needed to give a chance to respond to the allegations. McBride will implicate at least 30 people in his evidence, including those from high office in government. It is understood that his testimony will be explosive and will include alleged interference with the functions of IPID. Watch a related video below:
