President Cyril Ramaphosa has axed suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. This after a report, by retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, established that the pair is unfit to hold office in the NPA. The reports details that the two had compromised integrity, lack leadership skills and have poor ethical standards. President Cyril Ramaphosa had asked Justice Mokgoro to probe the advocates following questions over their fitness to hold office. They were suspended last year and had been given until the 16th of this month to give reasons why they shouldnâ€™t be fired. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
