The Commissioner of the SA Competition Commission, Tembinkosi Bonakele, has questioned how the fishing industry is being regulated. Bonakele has addressed delegates at a seminar on the Fishing Rights Allocation Process for 2020 underway in Somerset West near Cape Town.  The two-day seminar which ends on Wednesday is being hosted by the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries. Bonakele has highlighted loopholes which need to be monitored, regulated and rectified. “There’s no information on the size of the market I even doubt the value of the market itself because there is no one dedicated  in doing research. Even StatSA is not collecting this data. Unless you have transparent systems, some of the vessels, even process at sea, how do you even get that information?”
