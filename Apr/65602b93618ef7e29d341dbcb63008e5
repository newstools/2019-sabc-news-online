The house of traditional leadership in Limpopo has called on the Ramabulana family to resolve the kingship dispute that is currently before the courts. This follows the Appeals court decision to set aside the recognition of Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana as the King of the Venda tribe. Princess Masindi Mphephu interdicted the coronation of her uncle Tony in 2016. The appeals’ court ruling has opened the race between Toni and his niece Masindi. The house of traditional leaders will await the family’s decision. Experts believe that it will be difficult for Masindi to ascend the throne because the King is elected by paramount chiefs who currently support the incumbent Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana. Ramabulana is currently embroiled in a VBS scandal, with his name appearing on advocate Terry Motau’s report. The dispute has been referred back to Limpopo High Court. Watch a related video below:
