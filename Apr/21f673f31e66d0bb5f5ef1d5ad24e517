KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Sihle Zikalala has urged law enforcement agencies to conduct thorough investigations before effecting arrests. He was referring to the arrest and the provisional withdrawal of murder charges against the Harry Gwala District mayor Mluleki Ndobe. The ANC Provincial Executive Committee member spent a week behind bars in connection with the murder of former ANC Youth League leader Sindiso Magaqa. Delivering the Solomon Mahlangu Memorial Lecture in the Mzimkhulu region in the southern part of the province, Zikalala says he’s concerned that police and the National Prosecuting Authority are affecting arrests without conducting proper investigations. “As we are going through this lecture we are also encouraging unity in the structures of the ANC. Harry Gwala region has suffered negative publicity and we have also seen the incidents of killings of the comrades’ incidents of arrests, all of these things have affected the ANC internally. As we are in this lecture we call all structures to unite all members of the ANC to come together, work with the ANC on the issues of cases we are saying the law must take its course, we are of the view that those who are in charge of the law, and the law enforcement agencies in case they arrest, they must make sure that they conduct thorough investigations and then arrest. We therefore say members of the ANC must unite,” says Zikalala. Watch related video below for more on the story:
