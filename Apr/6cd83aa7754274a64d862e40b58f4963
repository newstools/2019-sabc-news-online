The Northern Cape Department of Education says it is willing to go to the Zondo Commission to answer to allegations of bribery levelled against it. Former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer, Angelo Agrizzi, recently testified at the Commission that a R10.5 million bribe had been paid to the department in order to secure a tender for security upgrades. The Department has since the revelations of the alleged bribery two weeks ago, not disputed or confirmed the Agrizzi’s testimony. “The Northern Cape Department of Education will give comment at the appropriate time with regards to the allegations levelled against the department during the Zondo commission. The Zondo commission was appointed by the president to investigate state capture and if we are called upon, we will cooperate,” says Lehuma Ntuane, department spokesperson. Meanwhile, African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Secretary, Deshi Ngxanga, says they will not defend anyone implicated in any wrongdoing. “They must go there themselves and defend themselves, provide a response there. We are in support of the work that commission and we are saying anyone who is implicated should go and answer for him or herself at the commission” says Ngxanga. Watch a related video below:
