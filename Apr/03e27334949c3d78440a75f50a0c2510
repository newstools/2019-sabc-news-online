The EFF in the Northern Cape has allegedly failed to pay some taxi drivers who transported supporters to the party’s provincial manifesto launch last month. The party, which has allegedly been giving the drivers the runaround, owes the drivers more than R20 000 after they took EFF members to Kuruman to listen to party leader Julius Malema. The angry drivers say working with the EFF was the worst business decision they had made. One of the taxi driver’s, John Kock says, “They used us, our businesses are suffering. Since that day, we have had to run after them, they are ignoring our calls; we want our money because we are also paying for these taxis. EFF does not know how to treat people. How will we be able to help them in the future?” EFF Provincial Secretary Shadrack Thlaole acknowledges that they owe the drivers, however, the party does not have money to pay them. “There are some taxi drivers that are not paid from our side. Remember the EFF, we do not have money. We are paying with the little resources that we have, we are going to pay that money when we have that money, we asked them to give us seven days, we cannot be dishonest.”
