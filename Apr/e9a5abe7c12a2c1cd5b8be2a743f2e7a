The Kusile Power Station Project, situated near eMalahleni in Mpumalanga, has reached a new milestone – Unit 3 was synchronised to the grid and produced its first power. The unit was loaded and kept stable at 60 megawatts, making it the third of the six units at Kusile Power Station to be synchronised to the national grid. Eskom’s Chief Operations Officer Jan Oberholzer says the next step will be testing and optimisation of the unit over several months – which means it will be providing intermittent power to the grid, and at times may even provide zero megawatts. Once all the testing is done, the unit will be fully powered at 800 megawatts and feed into the national grid for the country’s consumption. Related video click below:
