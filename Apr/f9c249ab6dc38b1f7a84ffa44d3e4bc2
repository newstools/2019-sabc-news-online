Police and emergency services are now equipped to deal with emergencies faster through a 24-hour call centre. The toll-free line links the caller to the South African Police Service and emergency and rescue teams. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Social Development , Weziwe Thusi, says positive changes include trained social workers manning the lines and 24-hour accessibility. “We have communicated with the SAPS so that if somebody is in trouble they are able to quickly contact the police and they are able to then go help. If you want help from an ambulance we are able to talk to the emergency services. We are going to have a geo locator so we can locate where the caller is and we are also going to have skype.” Thusi says the centre is equipped to deal with a range of social issues. “We might need help from government not for gender based violence only. Any problem that we have if you called us for grants, if they have problems with their social grants. Problems with substance abuse we do assist and refer relevant cases to the authorities.” The toll-free number is 087 158 3000.
