Arrangements are being made to remove the carcass of a whale shark that beached at Camps Bay in Cape Town on Saturday afternoon. Vets and marine scientists feared for the mammalâ€™s life as it was barely alive when it washed ashore. Efforts were made to keep it alive, but it died naturally on Saturday night. The Sea Rescue Institute says the Solid Waste Division of the City of Cape Town is already making plans to remove the carcass as soon as possible. In the meantime, the public and other animals are being kept away from the dead shark for safety reasons.
