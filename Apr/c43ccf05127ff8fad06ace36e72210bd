KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Co-operative Governance Nomusa Dube-Ncube says 23 lives have been lost in the province following persistent heavy rains and flooding. Meanwhile community members have joined the search and rescue team in searching for four missing family members in the Malven area south of Durban. The house is believed to have been washed away by the heavy rains. On the outskirts of the home neighbours together with search and rescue teams began searching for the members of this family from just after 10PM Monday night when the house collapsed. They resumed the search at 3AM on Tuesday as heavy rains persisted through the night. The rain hampered efforts to continue right through the night but rescue efforts resumed again Tuesday morning. The weather service says there will be about a three hour break from the rain and it is hoped that this break will allow the collapsed structure to be cleared. Meanwhile, the KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic inspectorate(RTI) has warned motorists to be cautious on the roads as some main roads have been affected by the floods. Provincial RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu-Mali says on the N-2 near the old airport cars are still submerged in water and parts of the N-3 are covered in mudslides.
