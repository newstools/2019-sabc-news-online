People are beginning to arrive at the Miki Yili Stadium at Makhanda in the Eastern Cape, for this year’s Freedom Day celebrations. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the Keynote Address. The country marks 25-years since the first democratic elections in 1994. A number of dignitaries are expected to descend to the small student town for Freedom Day celebrations. The cash strapped Makana Municipality has been working around the clock to ensure everything goes according to plan. This year’s celebrations coincide with the 200-years anniversary of the battle between the AmaXhosa warriors and the British Soldiers. The Xhosa warriors were led by Chief Makhanda Nxele after whom the town is named. In his speech, President Ramaphosa is expected to reflect on the country’s 25-years of democracy.
