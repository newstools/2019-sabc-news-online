President Cyril Ramaphosa says on this Freedom Day, South Africans should celebrate the gains made since the first democratic election in 1994, but also understand that work still needs to be done to right the injustices of the past. Ramaphosa delivered the Keynote Address at the main Freedom Day celebrations at the Miki Yili Stadium in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape.   The President also says the greatest tragedy of apartheid was the deep divisions it created amongst the people of this country. “Too many of our people still live in poverty, too many are still unemployed, too many are still homeless and too many do not have basic necessities of life. As we celebrate 25 years of democracy, we need to focus our attention and efforts on ensuring that all South Africans can equally experience the economic and social benefits of this freedom that we are celebrating today,” explains Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa started his Freedom Day Address by calling for a moment of silence for those who died in floods in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape as well as in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. This year’s Freedom Day Celebrations coincide with the 200 years anniversary of the battle between the AmaXhosa warriors and the British Soldiers in the Eastern Cape. Ramaphosa also paid tribute to late struggle stalwarts and those who fought in the battle.
