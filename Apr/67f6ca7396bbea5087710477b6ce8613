Former Free State MEC for Economic Development, Mxolisi Dukwana, is on Friday expected to take the stand at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. Dukwana served in the Free State executive council between 1994 and 2012. His testimony is expected to reveal how former Free State Premier Ace Magashule ran the province. He was fired in 2012 by Magashule for declining to take an alleged R2-million Gupta bribe. Magashule has admitted to knowing the controversial Gupta family, but has repeatedly denied being corrupt.   Meanwhile, the Congress of the People will be attending the Commission of Inquiry to show their support into the hearings. COPE is calling for all those implicated in the Bosasa and Gupta scandals to be charged and prosecuted.
