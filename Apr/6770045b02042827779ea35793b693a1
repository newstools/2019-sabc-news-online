A decision is yet to be made on the future of the lion that escaped from the Karoo National Park outside Beaufort West recently. The big cat spent about 26 days on the run before he was recaptured near Sutherland in the Northern Cape. The lion dug a hole under the fence and led park rangers on a chase. Park officials are still deciding on what to do with the lion. “He is much calmer now. He’s been fed every 3rd day to ensure that he remains in a good state. We are still to make a decision in terms of whether to relocate him somewhere else or to release him back into the Karoo National Park.” The question is whether the lion should be released into the wild or be returned to the park. “He is almost about the age of creating his own pride. So we are looking at a number of options.” Videos showing the lion spending a night in a police holding cells after it was recaptured went viral on social media. It was transported back Karoo National Park leaving many wondering whether it was released on bail. Click on video below:
