Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle says he will wait for a full assessment report, expected by Monday, before deciding whether to declare Port St Johns a disaster area. He says officials from the Home Affairs Department will be deployed at Port St Johns to assist those who’ve lost their documentation in the floods. On Wednesday, Masualle visited the worst affected areas such as Greens Farm and Mpantu townships, where hundreds of people have been left destitute. He says the heavy rains and floods had destroyed roads and houses. “Certainly the damage is very huge, I may not be able to give any figures at the moment. Our teams are on the ground. By Monday, we anticipate that they will have completed the report which will give us a sense of the estimate of the damage wherein the structures will kick in at a provincial level – hoping the magnitude itself does make for a case for a declaration of disaster. This will then enable us to really effect the emergency measures needed in that regard.” Watch related video:
