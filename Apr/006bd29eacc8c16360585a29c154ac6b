The African National Congress (ANC) in the City of Joburg says it is yet to prove whether its members are involved in inciting service delivery protests. This is after Johannesburg Metro Police allegedly discovered an ANC-branded bakkie loaded with tyres in Berea on Monday. The Democratic Alliance-led City says this is proof that the ANC is fuelling protests across the city. “Well, we are happy that the ANC is everywhere. You can find it in bakkies and everywhere. If the allegation is that those people were taking tyres to fuel service delivery protests that must be proven. The police need to act. If our members are involved in such, they will be obviously out of line and it is not ANC policy to be involved in service delivery protests,” says ANC’ Spokesperson in Johannesburg Jolidee Matongo.
