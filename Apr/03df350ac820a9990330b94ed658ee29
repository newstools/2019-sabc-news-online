Another day of drama in Alexandra It’s been another day of drama in Alexandra township, north east of Johannesburg. For the second day running, protests have flared up, disrupting schooling and making it difficult for people to get to work. Despite the Alex Shutdown organisers putting their protest on hold, residents nonetheless blockaded streets this morning. Few taxis were operating in the area but schooling was affected. The community are frustrated over housing issues. They claim foreign nationals are being prioritised for RDP houses.
