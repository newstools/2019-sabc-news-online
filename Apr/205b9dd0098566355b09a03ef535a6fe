The SABC welcomed members of the newly reconstituted SABC Board to the corporation on Tuesday. The Board, which includes the recently appointed eight Board members, now forms a quorum and will be able to fulfill its statutory and constitutional duties in stabilising the public broadcaster. The Chairperson of the Board, Bongumusa Makhathini, states “the new Board members join the organisation at a critical period when they are most needed to take the organisation forward.
