Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa ahead of the President’s expected visit to Alexandra on Thursday. Mashaba wants the President’s visit to involve all spheres of national, provincial and local government. Mayoral Spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka says, “The Mayor has thus requested the President’s visit on Thursday to be intergovernmental engagement with the people of Alexandra, the national government, province and the local government itself.” “The Mayor has made himself available for the engagement on Thursday should the President be amenable to the suggestion.” He says the approach will allow the government to collectively not only listen to the grievance of the people of Alexandra, but work towards designing a collective program that delivers solutions. Earlier, angry residents said they would boycott the upcoming May 8 elections should their demands for improved service delivery not be addressed. Related video:
