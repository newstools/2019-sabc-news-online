The Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, says the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is not about his relationship with former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head, Robert McBride. McBride is set to begin his testimony testimony on Thursday.  The commission was set to hear his testimony on Monday but it was postponed because the commission’s legal team failed to notify the people he has implicated. McBride is expected to implicate at least 30 people in his evidence, including those from high office in government. It is understood that his testimony will be explosive and will include alleged interference with the functions of IPID. Cele spoke to South African Broadcasting (SABC) News on whether he had any concerns about the possibility of being named in McBride’s testimony. “Well, if he’s going to say something, we should have received warning, now as we are supposed to do with all people that are going to be mentioned. We haven’t received anything. If it comes, we’ll face it as it comes,” says Cele. Mxolisi Zondo, the brother of the Chairperson of Commission Deputy Chief Justice Chairperson Raymond Zondo,  is said to have been implicated in McBride’s evidence. Watch a related video below:
