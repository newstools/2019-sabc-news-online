Forecasters say Cyclone Kenneth will bring with it heavy rainfall, strong winds, and waves of several metres. The government has issued a statement in a warning for people in southern parts of Tanzania. They said they should move from the coastal area because of the possibility of a storm surge, which is the rising of the ocean level towards these coastal areas.
