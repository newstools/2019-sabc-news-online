The City of Cape Town will be installing 159 CCTV cameras at various public transport interchanges and MyCiTi stations across Cape Town to monitor its various transport facilities. The cameras have now been installed in Claremont, Wynberg and the Cape Town Station Deck. The investment at nine of the City’s minibus-taxi ranks, comes at a cost of more than R11 million. The City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Felicity Purchase says Mitchells Plain, Khayelitsha and Bellville will have their cameras by the end of June. “Apart from the safety aspect, the cameras also boast technology that will provide the Transport Directorate with information about the lengths of queues and waiting times at the PTIs with lane-designated destinations, commuter counting and Internet-of-Things (IOT) sensors to provide traffic data,” explains Purchase.
