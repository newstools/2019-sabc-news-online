International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has dismissed reports that South Africa was in the possession of 30-million-US dollars belonging to the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, hidden at former President Jacob Zumaâ€˜s Nkandla home. The Sunday Times reported that the money was secretly moved to the then Swaziland, which is now called eSwatini, earlier in 2019 and President Cyril Ramaphosa has been asked to recover it. Sisulu says she is aware of the reports, and has dismissed them as nothing but rumours.
