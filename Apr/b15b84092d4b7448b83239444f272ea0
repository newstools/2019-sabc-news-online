Chairperson of Independent Media and Head of the Sekunjalo Group, Iqbal Surve, says he was not aware that the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) did not follow due diligence when the Ayo Technologies deal was concluded. He says former PIC Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dan Matjila, will have to explain. Surve concluded his two-day testimony before the Commission of Inquiry into the PIC in Pretoria on Wednesday. He said he was not aware that the deal process was flawed. “It seems that the Chairman of the PIC had an agenda when he did all of this. My answer is let’s look at all the facts that we have here and the transcripts that I have read, but what little I have read, seem to think that his transaction there was no issue with it,” says Surve.
