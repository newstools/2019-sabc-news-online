Communities in the flood hit areas of the Eastern Cape will see rapid infrastructure development, like bridges, to make their communities safer. Cooperative Governance Minister Zweli Mkhize has visited the area and says damage assessment is being conducted. The floods also caused major damage in neighbouring KwaZulu-Natal and claimed many lives. Mkhize also says a long term solution must be found for the residents of Green Fields in Port St Johns where flooding displaced hundreds of people. He commended the humanity shown by people during the floods. He says: “We want to convey our appreciation to the churches, business people and the communities who came in and rallied around those who were displaced. The municipality, we want to say thank you, they are the heroes to our people, they actually helped to save a lot of people.”
