The creche in Carletonville on the West Rand that has caused uproar on social media because of the alleged abuse of children has been closed down. Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza visited the nursery school on Thursday afternoon after video footage showing a day care teacher assaulting three children has sparked outraged around the country. Police have confirmed that the woman seen on the videos was arrested two weeks ago and is currently out on bail. She is due back in court next month. Mayathula-Khoza says the creche’s temporary permit expired in 2016. “So because the creche was found to be illegal and also because of the abuse of the children we then had to decide that the creche must be closed as a matter of urgency. So tomorrow they will receive a letter from social development of enforcement that will tell them that they should shut down the creche.” Please be warned some footage in the story may graphic.  Principal did not know about the alleged abuse The principal of the crèche says she did not know about the alleged abuse. Speaking to the SABC, her lawyer Danie van Zyl said the owner had no knowledge of the video or the abuse. Van Zyl says, “She did not have any idea the children were assaulted. One parent says she told her last year that her child cried every morning when taken to school and came home with bruises and she told the mom she was imagining the bruises on the child … My instruction is that there has been no previous information on that. That incident I cannot verify at all.” WATCH BELOW:
