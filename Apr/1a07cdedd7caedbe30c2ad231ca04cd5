The Hawks in the Eastern Cape have raided Nelson Mandela Bay mayor, Mongameli Bobani’s office and house in Port Elizabeth. Bobani has declined to comment on the matter but has told the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) News that he was not a criminal and had other pressing matters to address in the metro. He adds that he’s preparing for the upcoming elections. In February, Bobani faced a motion of no confidence vote which was submitted by councillor Marlon Daniels of the Patriotic Alliance (PA). Bobani’s legal representative, Danie Gouws says he was present during the raid by the Hawks in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. The Hawks swept in on the mayor’s office before moving to his house in Kwa-Magxaki. Gouws says Bobani co-operated fully with the police during the four hour raid. His wife’s laptop has been confiscated. The Hawks have yet to comment on the matter.
