A 34-year-old man accused of the rape and murder of a six-year-old girl from Elim in Overberg in Cape Town has abandoned his bail application in the Bredasdorp Magistrates Court. Delvina Europa went missing last month and her body found days later in bushes behind a school. The accused is known to the family. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila says two petitions by residents were handed up in court for bail to be denied. The case has been postponed until the 6th of May for further investigation.
