A memorial service will be held on Thursday for the 13-congregants who were killed when part of a Pentecostal Church building collapsed just before the Easter weekend at eMpangeni on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. The congregants were at the church for the Passover service when they were killed. Five other people will also be remembered after they died in a car crash. Six people sustained serious injuries. This is believed to have been a result of heavy rainfall that started in the northern parts of the province. So far, 70 people have been killed in this weekâ€™s floods. The 13 congregants are expected to be buried at the weekend. Click on the video below:
