The Human Rights Commission(HRC) in Gauteng will convene an inquiry next Thursday to find a solution to the issues plaguing residents at the Alexandra township north of Johannesburg. The commission announced this during a special City of Johannesburg council meeting on Friday.  This follows two weeks of violent protests in the area. Residents are demanding better services. The HRC’s Boang Jones says he will hold a consultation forum with the residents next Thursday. He says: “We used this City of Johannesburg council meeting as an opportunity to inform the city. The Mayor did not know that the commission intends to constitute a formal inquiry. So we thought this is a perfect opportunity to announce the commission’s intentions. This public inquiry will also be extended to the people of Alexandra where members of the community will be invited to share their lived experiences.” Meanwhile, Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba will meet with the Alexandra community on Monday. The City says more than R160 million has been set aside to deal with service delivery issues in Alexandra.
