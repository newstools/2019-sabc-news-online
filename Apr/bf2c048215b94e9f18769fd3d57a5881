Learning in an old dilapidated mud hut and squatting in a collapsing old shop is a thing of the past for the children of Kliproots farm outside Dannhausser in northern KwaZulu-Natal. On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa opened a new school building for the eNhlanhleni Primary School in the area. For many years, the school shared a building with a shop, causing frequent disruptions to teaching as clients come to buy goods. However, the tide turned recently when  government built a state of the art school for this deep rural community that is surrounded by farms. The principal of the school, Nomthandazo Luthuli, recalls how far they have come. “The school started in 2004, the school was in that side where there is a shop. The old school was a disgrace. Even my office was divided with a partition; there was a class this side and my office on the other side. Learning and teaching was a problem. Shoppers were reluctant to come to the shop since and the community was not comfortable because the shop was combined with the school teaching on the side they are buying food.” Click on video below:
