Rain and cold temperatures are still expected in some parts of the country for the remainder of Monday. This after snow was reported on the Maluti mountains in Lesotho causing a drop in temperatures in most parts of South Africa. Forecaster at the South African Weather Services, Khumsa Masizana says warmer temperatures should be expected from Wednesday. He says: “In Gauteng we are expecting cool temperatures with isolated to scattered showers and thunder showers. In Johannesburg and Vereeniging we expecting a 60% chance of thunder showers and temperatures are going to be cool.” “We’re expecting a 30% to 60% band across most parts of the country but a 80% over the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State as well as the eastern half of the Eastern Cape.” “Hopefully, the system will have moved past our country on Wednesday bringing some clearing mainly over the central parts of South Africa,” adds Masizana.
