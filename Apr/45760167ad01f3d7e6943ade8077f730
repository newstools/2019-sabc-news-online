Tshwane mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, has left the Gomorrah informal settlement in Pretoria West without addressing the crowd. Mokgalapa was forced to leave the area after the crowd demanded the release of over 20 community members who were arrested during Thursdayâ€™s protest. The community has been embarking on a service delivery protest since Thursday. Mokgalapa visited Gomorrah after the community requested that he come see their living conditions first hand, but on his arrival, things took another turn. The community members lost their patience with the mayor when he tried to address them from inside a police nyala, forcing him to leave the settlement. Police fired rubber bullets in a bid to disperse the crowd. Security remains tight with the police monitoring the close by Van der Hoff Road. Watch a related video below:
