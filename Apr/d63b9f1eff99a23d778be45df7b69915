KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) is counting the cost after devastating floods ravaged the province this week. About 70 people died and thousands have been displaced. Damage caused is estimated to run into tens of millions of rands. Described as the worst floods to hit the province in a decade, houses were completely destroyed while others were  submerged under water. Many roads also caved in. Over 1000 people were left homeless and now survivors are left to pick up the pieces. “This was like a volcano. The stones came down and broke all the houses,” says one victim. “I was shocked to see what was happening. There is nothing I could have done because it was raining heavily,” adds another victim.” Community members and various NGOs rolled up their sleeves to support by donating food and clothes to victims. On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa cut short his visit to Egypt and toured the hard-hit areas. He promised residents that government will provide assistance to all affected.  The Durban harbour was not spared as the sea flooded with plastics and other refuse. Questions have been raised about the water infrastructure in the eThekwini Municipality. However, the provincial government disputed claims that the drainage system is not being properly serviced. “It calls  on us to ensure that we improve the capacity of our municipalities to provide more services and to ensure that drainages are cleaned to ensure that everything is up to standard,” says acting KZN Premier, Sihle Zikalala. On Friday a special provincial cabinet was called on to map the way forward. Provincial government is still counting the costs. Search and rescue teams worked throughout the week to recover missing people and families continue to identify loved ones at the government mortuaries.
