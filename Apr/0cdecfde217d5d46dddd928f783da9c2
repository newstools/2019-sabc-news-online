As the water crisis has worsened in Makhanda, formerly known as Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, the Municipality is putting more measures in place to ensure that the town does not see Day Zero. The usable water in the Settlers Dam which supplies the western side of Makhanda is now at 7,6%. Once it reaches 7,4% it will be impossible to extract water from the dam. Some residents are anxious. “We need to accept that we need to stop playing and everyone should just collect their water. I feel like that could make a difference … but I think it’s a bigger issue than just individuals can help. “The way that the water is being distributed is unfair because some people don’t get water. The people in the suburban areas are the ones that get most of the water,” say some of the residents. Meanwhile, Municipal Mayor Mzukisi Mpahlwa says they are tackling the water crisis. “We are using boreholes and we are also diverting the water from the eastern side to the western side. So, we will also be toppling the water so that it comes slower and we are appealing to people that they must use 50l per person a day,” says Mpahlwa.
