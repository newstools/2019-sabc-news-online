Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says her department is in ongoing discussions with National Treasury for a financial bail-out for the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC.) She says this is to allow for the SABC to implement its turnaround strategy. Ndabeni-Abrahams was responding to a written Parliamentary question by Freedom Front Plus MP, Anton Alberts. Ndabeni-Abrahams says while government recognises that the SABC requires urgent financial assistance, a final decision on the type of assistance as well as the exact amount has however not been reached. The public broadcaster told Parliament recently that it was facing insolvency if nothing was done about its financial situation. The minister says her department and National Treasury are assisting the SABC in its application for both a government guarantee and financial bailout. She says these applications are meant to assist the SABC from falling into insolvency. Watch related video below:
