President Cyril Ramaphosa has lamented the state of the country and expressed concern about the erosion of the country’s social fabric. He was speaking at an engagement with religious leaders from a broad range of denominations and African traditional religions.  South Africa continues to face high unemployment, inequality, gender-based violence and crime. These are just some of the reasons that prompted a dialogue between President Ramaphosa, religious and traditional leaders. Ramaphosa says collaboration is needed to pave way for societal renewal.  “This is not the South Africa we dreamt of and the one we want. We are here to discuss how we can work together to undo the effects of the past.” The President signed a document, a ‘Presidential Statement of Intent for Societal Renewal’ as the first step in creating a national strategic plan. Gauteng Social Development MEC, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza says the intent will soon be made into a declaration that will be enforced to better the lives of South Africans. “Government shall monitor the implementation of the national strategic plan on a quarterly basis.” Representatives of the religious community had mixed reactions to the dialogue. One religious leader says, “We need to unite as various traditional and religious leaders.” Another one adds, “I am quite excited about this opportunity, but we need more solutions.” The statement of intent will later be amended to a declaration in six months.
