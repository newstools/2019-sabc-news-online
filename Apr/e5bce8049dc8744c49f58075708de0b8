An investigator of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has detailed the inspections that were conducted on the various properties of government officials who benefited from the installation of security features at their homes by Bosasa’s Special Projections. Patrick Mlambo says former Bosasa employee Richard le Roux accompanied him to the homes of ANC NEC chairperson Gwede Mantashe, former Correctional Services boss, Linda Mti and former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni. Mlambo, who is testifying before the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, has confirmed that Le Roux was right when he said that when they went to carry out security upgrades at Mantashe’s house in Elliot Eastern Cape, they slept in a lodge nearby. They were looking for security features installed by Bosasa. Mlambo testified that Mantashe and Myeni were furious that they were not informed of the inspection. He also said after inspecting Mantashe, he received a call from the ANC National Chairperson’s wife, who was not impressed. The commission is also expected to hear the testimony of former Bosasa employee Richard le Roux and Marijke de Kock of the National Prosecuting Authority. Click video below for more on the story:
