A Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting turned chaotic again shortly after it started on Thursday morning. Disgraced ANC Ward Councillor, Bongo Nombiba’s presence in council was questioned by councillors who called it illegal. Nombimba was given a five-year prison sentence after the court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in 2018. His appeal was then rejected, but he has subsequently filed a petition to the Constitutional Court. The Hawks have confirmed that the warrant for his arrest has been retracted and his bail has been extended. However, that is not the only hot topic in chambers. The DA disrupted the council, breaking out in song and hoisting placards that read “What the Hawks have on Bobani.” On Wednesday, the house and office of the Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor, UDM’s Mongameli Bobani was raided by the Hawks. On Thursday, he also faced another motion of no confidence in council. It was the third motion against him. Tensions were also high as ANC and EFF councillors called for Nqaba Bhanga to leave council chambers for being rude to the speaker on Thursday morning. He refused to leave. The speaker, Buyelwa Mafaya also laid charges of crimen injuria against Bhanga for allegedly calling her “crazy” during the previous council meeting. The DA dismissed this as a diversion tactic to take the focus off the Hawks operations against the mayor. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
