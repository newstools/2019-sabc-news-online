DA Gauteng Premier Candidate, Solly Msimanga will create a bonfire using hundreds of Gauteng residents’ e-toll statements outside Sanral offices in Rooihuiskraal in Centurion. The party received hundreds of e-toll statements from Gauteng residents who cannot afford to pay e-tolls. Msimanga says he’ll use the e-toll statements to create a bonfire and demonstrate to Sanral and the ANC government that the system is not working and that it must be scrapped.  The South African National Roads agency(Sanral) two weeks ago said it would stop pursuing historic debt and summonses applied for since 2015. This after a request from President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the e-tolls payment impasse.
