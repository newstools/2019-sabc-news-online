Government will step in should Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) and Sibanye Gold Mines fail to resolve the ongoing wage dispute. This is according to President Cyril Ramaphosa who has urged both parties to seek an amicable but legal resolution. He was speaking from an event where he was having a dialogue with white South Africa compatriots.  Running since 21 November, the Amcu strike now enters its fifth month. The union has persisted with strike action at Sibanye’s three large gold mines in Gauteng, as well as the Free State, even after three other unions settled. Ramaphosa says government should never be seen to be dictating terms to either union nor employer. He seems optimistic. “I believe the strike will be resolved because the strike is having a huge negative impact on the workers, we urge the parties themselves to find solutions, find a way in which they can resolve this. We stand ready to be of assistance at any time,” says Ramaphosa. President Ramaphosa says government seeks to avoid all forms of violence; and stands ready to prevent it.   On Eskom, Ramaphosa says the biggest challenge is funding. He says they are currently looking at several options to deal with the power crisis adding that South Africans should never again have to experience stage 4 load-shedding.
