The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says the appearance of Gauteng Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation MEC, Faith Mazibuko before it earlier on Tuesday is a clear indication that it deals with matters of concern without fear or favour. Mazibuko will now have to attend a diversity and sensitivity programme following her outbursts related to the leaked ‘combi courts’ audio recording, which surfaced in March. The commission has found that the comments were more divisive than racial and Mazibuko has again apologised. The SAHRC’s Commissioner Andre Gaum says they were severely criticized after their recent findings that while comments by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, were unacceptable and not in the interest of nation-building, they did not amount to hate speech. “Unfortunately, there was a lot of criticism, including that we’re afraid of people and so on. And I think the fact that we got the MEC here today, demonstrates once again that the commission is acting without fear, favour or prejudice, that we’re independent and we’re afraid of absolutely no one. And if Mr Malema or anyone else, in the run up to the election oversteps the mark, the commission will indeed act.” Watch video below for more on the story:
