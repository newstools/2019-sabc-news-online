The Road Traffic Management Corporation has assured motorists that they won’t be arrested unfairly after eating hot cross buns. This follows a video that has gone viral showing a traffic officer testing positive for alcohol consumption after eating a hot cross bun. The RTMC says the breath testing device used is a screening instrument and the first results obtained from it have to be validated through further tests before an arrest can be made. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane explains says, “The intention is to test alcohol in your body. So the example you saw in the video, you just testing what is in the mouth, the fermentation that releases ethanol in the mouth and alcohol in the mouth is not sufficient evidence to prosecute. Where they don’t have the E-BAT, evidential breathe analyzing technology, they will take blood but they also have to have reasonable suspicion that you were drunk.”
