South African diplomatic missions around the world are making final preparations for the almost 30 000 citizens who will make their marks in the country’s national election. Voting abroad takes place on Saturday at High Commissions, Embassies and Consulates-general all over the world. In New York, just over 600 registered voters are expected to make their mark. Globally, voting starts in Auckland, New Zealand and ends at the South African Consulate in Los Angeles. The process is conducted by South African diplomats who have been trained by the Independent Electoral Commission. “We are expecting 605 voters. They should bring their old ID and a valid passport or they should bring their smart ID or a temporary certificate with a valid passport. We’re going to go through their documents and the list we received from IEC to see if they appear on the list. Ballots are not going to be counted here. They will put in a sealed envelope and then in a courier bag and then it will be shipped to Pretoria,” says one of the diplomats at the Consulate General in New York Evelyn Kgwatla.  As South Africans living abroad prepare to cast their votes on Saturday, the International Relations and Co-operation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has urged South Africans abroad to vote on Saturday.
