Hundreds of residents, mostly women and children have been evacuated from the heavily flooded Green Farm in Port St Johns in the Eastern Cape. Flash floods have affected low lying areas as the major Mzimvubu River burst its banks, while more rain is expected. The OR Tambo Municipality Disaster Management team and government officials are working to evacuate those who are still trapped. Port St Johns municipality speaker, Ayanda Gantsho says high tides in the ocean from the afternoon to midnight usually make life difficult for the coastline inhabitants. He says high tides push the volume of river water along the Umzimvubu river banks, resulting in flooding. Gantsho says this is common during this time of the year. WATCH BELOW:
