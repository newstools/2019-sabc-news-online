President Cyril Ramaphosa says a new model used to build better schools in the country will help in eradicating schools without water, sanitation and electricity. Ramaphosa was speaking in Dannhauser in northern KwaZulu-Natal, at the official handing over ceremony of three new schools. The three schools were previously mud structures built by the community over 30 years ago. The new modern brick structures were built with the aid of the Adopt-A-School Foundation. Ramaphosa explains: “The resources are going to be the biggest challenge because it is a response issue but we are going to speed up installation of infrastructure in our schools and correct some of the things that have not been properly done. So I’m confident that we are on the right path and we are going to do things correctly for our children because they are our biggest investment.” WATCH BELOW:
