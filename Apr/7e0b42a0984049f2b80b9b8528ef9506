The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department’s Wayne Minnaar has advised motorists to exercise caution on the roads as the Easter period ends. Monday marks the end of the Easter period and traffic is expected on roads leading in and out of Gauteng as residents make their way back home. JMPD officers are expected on all main roads and highways. Minnaar says motorists should obey the rules of the road. “As motorists make their way to Gauteng, they are encouraged to be extra cautious and vigilant. They should look out for pedestrians, they should obey the speed limit and they should not overtake when it’s not safe and particularly not over solid white lines. Many officers are on duty on Monday, particularly the N1 from Limpopo, the N3 from the KZN, the N4 from Mpumalanga and also the N12 which will be heavy with traffic from the North West.
