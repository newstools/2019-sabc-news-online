Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, has lashed out at the ANC for blaming his leadership for service delivery and housing problems in Alexander North of the city. This as protests have flared up for a second day in the township – despite calls by ‘Total Shutdown’ organizers to temporarily suspend demonstrations, due to security concerns. Wednesday, residents took to the streets to protest against the mushrooming of illegal structures in the area. Businesses and schools were closed for the day and commuters were left stranded. Residents have threatened to continue protesting until Mashaba attends to their concerns. Mashaba explains…“Whatever happens in the City of Johannesburg, I have to take the responsibility. What is strange that they are the one blaming me for failing people of Alex, because housing is the competency of the City of Joburg. When I took over, government had R411-million for housing for 2016/17. When they lost and I came over, they cut my budget for housing to R245-million, so this is why I can’t understand why they are blaming me.” Earlier, ANC Ward 105 Councillor Tefo Raphadu attributed the reasons for the protests to poor leadership by Mashaba. “It is highly disappointing. The challenges that Alex is having now are not historical problems. The problems happening under Mashaba’s watch – for example, a burst pipe are not a historical problem, rubbish not picked up is not a historical problem, it’s him. He must take responsibility because he says he will deliver and do better. We know what the first administration did but this is under your watch.” Click on the interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/673121">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on video below:
