Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor says Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges are the key to meeting South Africa’s economic trajectory. She says thousands of artisans are in great demand worldwide. Pandor says it is unfortunate that most South Africans accept university education as the only legitimate form of education. She says TVET colleges offer a number of skills that are scarce and critical for the country’s economic growth.  Pandor addressed a conference in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg. “The gap in South Africa is in need of 80 000 artisans annually, and worldwide it’s 1.5 million artisans needed. So, all over the world, they are looking for skill. That I just got to know when I became minister in this department. They’re looking for Millwrights; they’re looking for Fitters; they’re looking for Turners; they’re looking for Welders. Welding is a scarce skill.”
