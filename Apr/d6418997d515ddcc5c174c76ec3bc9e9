Nokia is making a comeback in South Africa. This week, the Finnish company launched the Nokia 9 PureView featuring five cameras – a first in the smartphone market. Nokia says the five lenses on the PureView 9  capture an image simultaneously,  then combines the five shots into one 12MP photo. The smartphone is aimed at photography and video lovers, especially those aiming for  professional quality photographs. “The Nokia 9 PureView features the world’s first five camera array system with ZEISS Optics,”notes Nokia. It captures HDR (High Dynamic Range) pictures and features the ability to capture in  uncompressed RAW”DNG” format. Nokia partnered with Adobe Lightroom which enables one to edit pictures on the phone with a more advanced tool compared to basic photo editing tools on most devices. The smartphone runs on the Android 9 Pie operating system. “Android 9 Pie includes AI-powered features to make your device smarter, faster and adapt to your behaviour as you use it, so your smartphone experience gets better with time,” notes Nokia. The Finnish Company seems to be slowly resurrecting in an industry it once dominated, but fell back in with the rise of competitors like Samsung, Apple and Huawei.  Just this week, Huawei also launched the much anticipated P30 series, a significant contender in SA’s smartphone market. Samsung launched the Galaxy S10 and S10+ smartphones in February this year. The Nokia PureView isn’t cheap. The high end smartphone , which is currently only available from Vodacom, retails for R11.849.00 on prepaid or R699 per month on contract.
