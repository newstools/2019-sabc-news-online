As the country commemorates Freedom Day, some sections of the society are still trapped by the demons of the past. At a small farming town of Coligny, in the North West relations have soured, with residents divided along racial lines, following the much publicised incident of the killing of 16 year-old Matlhomola Mosoeu by two farm-workers Phillip Schutte and Pieter Doorewaard. In April 2017, the town went up in smoke after Mosweu was killed by two farm workers who allegedly caught him stealing sunflowers, on their employer’s farm. They loadeded him onto the back of a bakkie and drove around, before throwing him off, to his death, while the vehicle was in motion. The incident sparked mass protests with several houses and trucks belonging to white residents torched. The incident turned whites and blacks against one another. The two were sentenced in February this year. Even though Schutte and Dooreward tried to apologize to Matlhomola’s family forgiveness was not on the horizon. Watch Video Below For More:
