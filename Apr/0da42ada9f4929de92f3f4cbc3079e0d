Corruption Watch says it wants former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe declared a delinquent director. Late last year, Corruption Watch launched an application in the high court in Pretoria seeking to have certain former members of the board of Eskom declared as delinquent directors. The organisation also wants the court to declare that Molefe, Mark Pamensky, Anoj Singh, Venete Jarlene Klein, and Zethembe Wilfred Khoza acted in a manner that amounted to gross negligence with regards to the performance of their functions towards Eskom in terms of the Public Finance Management Act.
