Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the Oakdale Secondary school in Ennerdale south of Johannesburg will under-go a major facelift. Schooling has been disrupted again on Tuesday morning. The community has vowed to shut down the school until the Education department has removed the 16 unused mobile classrooms and fix the roofs of four classes which were blown-off by a storm in October 2018. They burned one of the classrooms on Tuesday saying the structures have become drug dens. Panyaza Lesufi says they have secured a budget for Oakdale Secondary school. “That school needs a complete overhaul. And because it was not in our financial plans we had to go and bid for the budget, a budget that we only received in March.” “And we communicated that information to the SGB’s. There is now a budget that is starting now in April that will allow us to not only renovate the school, but overhaul the school as well.” Click video below:
