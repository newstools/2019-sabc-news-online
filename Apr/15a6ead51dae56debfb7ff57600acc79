At least 1 800 miners are trapped underground at Sibanye-Stillwater mine in Rustenburg in the North West. The mine says the miners might not be able to exit via one of its mine shafts due to possible damage. Sibanye-Stillwater Spokesperson James Wellsted said rails, which were being transported down its Thembelani shaft via a conveyance belt, fell down the shaft at its platinum operations. Wellsted said they have to do a full shaft inspection, clear the rails if any have been stuck in the shaft and make sure there has been no significant damage to the steelwork. He said the miners have been provided with food and water. Wellsted said if the shaft was damaged, the workers would have to exit via its Khuseleka shaft which was 4 kilometres away.
