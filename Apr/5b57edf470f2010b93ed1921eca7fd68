More than 270 election staff in Indonesia have died, mostly due to fatigue-related illnesses caused by long hours of working,  counting millions of ballot papers by hand. The April 17 elections were the first time the country of 260-million people combined the presidential vote with national and regional parliamentary ones, with an aim to cut costs. Voting is estimated to have drawn 80% of the population who each had to punch up to five ballot papers in over 800 000 polling stations. According to the General Elections Commission, the Health Ministry has issued a circular letter urging health facilities to give utmost care for sick election staff, while the Finance Ministry is working on compensation for families of the deceased.
