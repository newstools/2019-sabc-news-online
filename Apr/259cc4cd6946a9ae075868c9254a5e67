Terror attacks in Kenya in January have not had adverse effects on tourism to the East African Country, that’s according to Kenya’s High Commissioner to South Africa, Jean Kamau. She was speaking on the sidelines of the Kenya Trade Investment Summit taking place in Johannesburg. Kamau says the Kenyan government has moved with speed to deal with threats and to assure visitors and locals of their safety. The summit is held to explore deepening trade relations between Kenya and South Africa. Trade imbalance between the two countries is in favour of South Africa, but there is continued dialogue to look for ways to ease the barriers to trade. The challenges limiting trade are tariffs and constraints in the movement of goods and people. Kenya is looking at attracting investments in manufacturing of textiles, motor vehicle and car parts as well as value addition in various sectors to enhance food security and the construction of affordable housing. Kamau says Kenya is also prioritising safety and security in light of the recent terror attacks. The event brings players to drive mutual beneficial investments between the two countries. Unlocking infrastructure to promote integration is seen as key to boosting trade and economic growth on the continent. Research by TRALAC shows that when looking at South Africa’s global trade, Kenya is ranked 27th amongst South Africa’s export destinations, and accounting for just about 1% of South Africa’s total exports. Meanwhile in terms of imports, Kenya does not feature in the top 30 import suppliers to the South African market. When looking at the Africa market, Kenya is ranked 10th export destination for South Africa’s goods, and is ranked 22nd most important import source from Africa.
