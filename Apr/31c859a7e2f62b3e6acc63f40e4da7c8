ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte has requested a meeting with the editorial team of eNCA as well as the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef). This follows a verbal altercation between Duarte and eNCA journalist Samkele Maseko, during a media briefing at Luthuli House on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement released by Duarte’s office, the ANC says it “has noted the one-sided and biased story given by eNCA on the interaction between Maseko and Duarte”. This was presumably in reaction to eNCA’s coverage of the event after Duarte’s rant had gone viral on social media. Maseko says it’s not clear why he was attacked. “I do recall that when we first entered the briefing room she did say she won’t be taking any attacking questions from eNCA and myself on this particular issue surrounding the secretary general of the ANC Ace Magashule, and that she will not be working or serving the eNCA as my camera colleague was late, it all stemmed from there. Then she went on to attack my employers saying we are running a campaign to get rid of Malusi Gigaba, Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane from the ANC list to the National Assembly,” he says.
