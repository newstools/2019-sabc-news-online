Cape Town International Airport has embarked on a major upgrade project totaling R7 billion  over the next five years. General Manager Deon Cloete briefed the media in Cape Town. He says major projects include re-aligning the runway, refurbishing the domestic terminal and expanding the international terminal.  Cloete says the project is expected to create a number of job opportunities. “It really brings all the other parties closer to see what we can do and how we’re going to do it. Very important the runway project although very significant is one of the project we will deliver sooner rather than later. It’s a 2 to 3 year project. The domestic arrival also on a shorter period 2 to 3 years. And international terminal quiet complex, we’re doing phasing in different stages some what longer we’re doing 4 to 5 year project there.” The Western Cape Minister of Economic Opportunities Beverly Schäfer says the upgrading of the Cape Town International Airport will boost the province’s drive to grow the tourism sector. Airport City has already contributed R4,7 billion to South Africa’s economy. Schäfer visited the airport for a briefing on future upgrades. R7 billion will be invested over the next 5 years to re-align the runway, refurbish the domestic terminal and expand the international terminal. Schäfer says the upgraded Airport will result in greater air access into Cape Town and the province. “The expansion plans in the runway realignment will go a long way towards extending the success of this project well into the future, and we really delighted that the airport is expanding because it signals that there’s been tremendous growth in the number of people travelling. We have seen a 16% increase in passenger numbers in 2016 and 20% increase in 2017.”
