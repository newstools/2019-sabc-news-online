Minister of Police Bheki Cele says law and order will prevail during the May 8th general elections. This despite the eruption of sporadic service delivery protests across the country. Some communities, where these protests are happening, have threatened not to allow elections to take place if their demands are not met. Cele accompanied by the National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla Sitole, attended the official opening of a Police Station at Mareetsane, some 40 kilometres from Mahikeng in the North West. “That the elections are threatened, definitely, IEC will have to look at that. And with the support of government, if they call for help, the national commissioner is here, we’ll see how we support the elections going forward. But election itself must be safe, election must be protected. And we will be, as the South African police, giving the way out, giving the roll-out on how we are going to work that, in a few hours to come. Not today, but in few days to come.”  Watch  related video below:
