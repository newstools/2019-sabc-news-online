Kimberley police remain on high alert following a violent scuffle between artisanal miners and Ekapa Mine security guards. It is alleged that the scuffle started ON Friday morning when the miners forced entry into the mine – leading to police using rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The miners allegedly wanted to mine on a restricted area. The mine previously awarded some small scale miners mining dumps and land they could work on. Northern Cape Police spokesperson Tessa Jansen says the situation remains tense. “They waited for the sun to set so there was an interaction again with the security and they were shot with pellets by the security company. We do not know where they are, so we will be on standby to prevent further interactions between them and the security company.”
