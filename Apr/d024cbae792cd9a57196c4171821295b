Pietermaritzburg community members have raised concerns about unresolved murder and rape cases in the area. During an imbizo with the community, Police Minister Bheki Cele committed to addressing the community members’ concerns. Cele says the concerns raised include that of the shortage of police and vehicles. He says, “There are few things that we are going to do quick and soon. One of those things is to send an inspectorate to look around the stations and identify what we are doing wrong.” “Secondly, we are going to send the resource management team to see what shortages we have so we can work towards resourcing in the shortest possible time.”
