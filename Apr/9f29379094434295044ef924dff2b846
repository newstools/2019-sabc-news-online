Poor rainfall in Gauteng may cause the Department of Water and Sanitation to prolong level-one water restrictions. The Vaal Dam, which is responsible for supplying water to most parts of the province has dropped to below 68,73%. Officials are warning residents to use water sparingly. Spokesperson for Water and Sanitation Sputnik Ratau says, “In recognition of the fact that inland provinces haven’t received as much rainfall as we would’ve wanted it to be as government, some of our municipalities have taken the responsibility to make sure that water consumption in their environment is under control. In that instant the City of Johannesburg and the City of Tshwane are continuing with their level one water restriction in order to make sure that their consumers within the environment continue to use water sparingly.” Watch related videos below for more on the story:
