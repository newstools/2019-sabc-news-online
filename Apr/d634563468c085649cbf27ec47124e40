The United Nations says humanitarian aid agencies have prepositioned supplies for the impact and aftermath of Cyclone Kenneth, but assessing damage in the Comoros where Kenneth hit en route to Mozambique is proving difficult. It has left a trail of destruction in the Comoros Island where three people have died. Violent winds of up to 140 kilometres per hour lashed the East African island nation. The cyclone has brought with it strong winds and torrential rain to Mozambique before heading to Tanzania. UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric says “The Government, the Red Crescent Society and the UN are assessing the impact due to the remoteness of the three islands hit by the Cyclone, assessing that damage is a challenge.” UN says unconfirmed reports from the Comoros include extensive damage to houses and flooded villages due to sea surges and flooded dykes, roads have also been cut off by fallen trees. “In Mozambique in anticipation of Cyclone Kenneth’s landfall there, the office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has been working towards putting search and rescue teams on alert for possible deployment if required. Humanitarian organisations are prepositioning supplies and have teams on standby to deploy to the area. Possible needs will include shelter, water, food and non-food items, power generators as well as telecommunications equipment. This is the first time in history that Mozambique is hit by two Cyclones in one season,” Dujarric explains. Related videos: E
