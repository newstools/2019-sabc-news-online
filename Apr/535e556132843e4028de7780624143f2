Judgment in the bail application of three suspects implicated in the murder of former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) Secretary-General Sindiso Magaqa has been postponed to May. The accused appeared briefly in the Umzimkhulu Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier on Thursday. The accused will have to wait another two weeks before judgement in their bail application is passed. Judgement was expected to be handed down on Thursday but had to be postponed after the Magistrate presiding over this matter was not present in court. The accused in this matter face one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder of Jabulile Msiya and Nontsikelelo Mafa who sustained gunshot wounds on the day Magaqa was gunned down. Judgment for bail will be handed down on the 7 May. Click below for more on Sindiso Magaqa:
