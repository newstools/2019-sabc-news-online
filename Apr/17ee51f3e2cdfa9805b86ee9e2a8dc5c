North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un is in Russia, where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin in their first-ever summit. They discussed the prospect of North Korea destroying its nuclear weapons. And afterwards, President Putin hinted at wanting a bigger role in negotiations between Chairman Kim and the US leader Donald Trump. They are neighbours, who had never met. But an afternoon of talking and then dining together seems to have marked the start of a new, closer relationship. The one-to-one talks between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un lasted for twice the amount of time allocated in the schedule, suggesting the two men got on well. Afterwards, President Putin called Chairman Kim an interesting and informative speaker. The main issue on the agenda had been whether North Korea would ever give up its nuclear weapons – in return for the lifting of international sanctions that are strangling North Korea’s economy. Two months ago, a summit between Chairman Kim and the United States’ leader Donald Trump ended prematurely, with no deal. Vladimir Putin said Kim Jong Un would need more guarantees of his security and sovereignty – not just from the US but from other countries in the region as well. And he seemed to offer himself as a mediator – saying that Chairman Kim had even asked him to speak directly to the United States. We didn’t hear from Chairman Kim after the talks, but beforehand he said it was a ‘great joy’ to be in Russia. He said that he was grateful for Russia’s support – at a time in history when, he said, all eyes are glued to the Korean Peninsula.
