The Gift of the Givers Foundation says itâ€™s working around the clock to ensure the release of photojournalist Shiraaz Mahomed, who was abducted in Syria in January 2017 after being accused of being a foreign spy.

The International Relations Department says it will go through its own processes to verify the authenticity of the video. Watch video below:
