Public schools countrywide are still surrounded by poor infrastructure, teacher absenteeism and lack of water and sanitation. This is according to the School Monitoring Survey (SMS) report that was released by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga in Pretoria on Monday. The report was commissioned by the Basic Education Ministry two years ago to measure progress of public schools as set out in 2019 Action Plan. Motshekga conceded that sub-standard infrastructure at schools remains the biggest challenge for the department. “Only 59% of our schools comply with the determined minimum infrastructure, physical infrastructure norms and standards.” “A worrying fact that only 76% of our schools have running water. So, which means that we still have schools where children have to bring potable water to school or the provinces have to provide alternatives in schools.” “And again, in terms of sanitation out, of 26% schools only 80% have what we call appropriate sanitation infrastructure.” Meanwhile, the department says it is working around the clock to meet its three-year target to eradicate pit toilets at schools in the country. The commitment comes as Basic Education delivered the 2017/ 2018 School Monitoring Survey. Click video below for more on the story:
