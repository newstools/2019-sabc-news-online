A group of students from the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth has held a silent protest during a graduation ceremony. The students are not happy about the outcome of the sexual assault cases at the institution. A small group of young women dressed in black took to the front of the hall during a session of degree conferment at Nelson Mandela University’s South campus on Friday. This as graduand names were called out as they received their qualifications. The group with tapes over their lips went to the front, caring not to interrupt the proceedings, and raised their placards. “I live in a rape culture”, “We deserve a rape free campus” and “Rapist graduates at NMU” were just some of the messages scribbled in the placards. It was a demonstration to highlight their pain and fight against rape, what they have labelled a rape culture infiltrating in their institution. Students have several times raised concerns over the number of rape incidents. Chancellor of the institution Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi acknowledged the students and their silent protest. She promises that their issues will be addressed.
