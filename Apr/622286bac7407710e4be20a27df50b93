Former President Kgalema Motlanthe has called on former freedom fighters to always integrate the youth into the programs that will assist South Africa to progress. He says the skills they have will be of great assistance in shaping the future of the country. The former President was speaking during the launch of the 70s Group in Johannesburg. Comprising of those who fought for the liberation of South Africa, the 70s Group seeks to honour the youth of the 1970s and thus nurture today’s youth for a prosperous country. Now officially launched, the programme will push the agenda of social cohesion in all corners of the country. Motlanthe says there’s a need for the group to always involve the youth, share experience and skills that will see a prosperous South Africa, free from all obstacles and other challenges. And former Secretary General of South African Students Organisation (Saso) Barney Pityana agrees. He says a lot has to be learnt from the youth of 1970s. Montlanthe has also called on the group members to fight the existence of “Bantu Education” in the townships across the country.
