Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has dismissed former SA Revenue Service  (SARS) boss Tom Moyane‘s application to cross examine Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan. He delivered the decision on Tuesday morning at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg. Moyane applied to the State Capture Commission of Inquiry to cross examine Gordhan on his version of how Moyane was appointed as SARS Commissioner. In March, Moyane argued in his application that the right to confront one’s accuser was not only fair but just. Gordhan opposed the application saying the inquiry shouldn’t allow the cross examination because Moyane was disgruntled and wanted a public platform to denigrate him. Click video below:
