The family of South African photojournalist, Shiraaz Mahomed, have broken their silence over a video showing Mahomed in captivity. In a statement, the family has expressed gratitude that Mahomed is still alive but pleads with his abductors to release him. In the video, Mahomed is seen be kneeling while being flanked by a man wearing a balaclava and holding an AK 47 assault rifle. He was abducted in January 2017 in Syria and accused of being a foreign spy. “As heartbreaking as it is to see our brother in that way, we are very relieved to see that he is alive. With Ramadan almost upon us, we plead with those who have our brother to please release him, he is innocent and we need him home with his family and loved ones. We are beside ourselves with worry and our mom’s health is deteriorating as a result of all the stress. Our mom’s only wish is to see our brother and hold him in her arms again before she passes on.” This is an excerpt from the statement released by Mahomed’s family. The family has appealed to President, Cyril Ramaphosa, Gift of the Givers and anyone who can assist in Mahomed’s safe release. They have also thanked government and the NGO for continued support.
