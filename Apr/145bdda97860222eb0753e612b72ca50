The two accused in a rhino poaching case, who were arrested two weeks ago after police received a tip-off, have been granted bail by the Brits Magistrate’s court in the North West. Petrus Steyn was granted R20 000 bail, while Clive Melville got R100 000 bail. Steyn and Melville were arrested while in possession of over 150 rhino horns. According to police, the cargo was bound for Asian countries. Save The Rhino Organisation says in just a decade, more than 8300 African rhino have been lost to poaching. South Africa has nearly 80% of the world’s rhinos. The trial against the two is expected to resume on July 12th.
