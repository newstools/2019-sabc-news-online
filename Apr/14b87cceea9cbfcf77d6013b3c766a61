Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha says 25 years of democracy have brought free education and access to health care. Mathabatha says the achievement should be celebrated. He was speaking during the provincial Freedom Day celebration at Bakenburg outside Mokopane. “In fact I will say about 90% of schools in this province are no fee schools which says even a child coming from a poor background can still become a doctor. If that’s not reason enough to celebrate what else can we celebrate? At least you’ll get free primary health care everybody including these people who don’t even have money they’ll still get attention when they go there.”
