Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has switched on four Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) decoders at Ikhwezi Lokusa Special School at Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. This is part of piloting the project of migrating from analogue to digital. Ndabeni-Abrahams led an inter-departmental outreach programme in the area on Monday. She says there are more than 20 000 households in the area of Mthatha alone that stand to benefit in the government-subsidised DTT program. “The DTT program is very important because it’s a program that presents an opportunity not only for broadcasters but also for content developers, lots of opportunities but starting with a clear vision that you get to see on your screen once you get connected to the box. But on top of that we’re going to be expanding the TV channels that we have from SABC. Currently we have four channels as you know, we’re adding six more and in total we’re going to have 16. And if I’m saying we’re adding it means we’re going to need lots of presenters, actors, people who produce the content so that as we talk of social cohesion. Indeed people can be able to express themselves in their own languages.”
