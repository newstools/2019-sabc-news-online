They will be released into the care of their parents until their appearance in court. Another learner who’s 20 was arrested for possession of drugs and a dangerous weapon. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “Unfortunately our learners revolted and started behaving in a manner that is unacceptable, stoning the police and went to an extent of assaulting of the police officials and that led to some of the learners being arrested. Later some of them then marched to the police station demanding the release of their fellow learners. It was something which was really unheard off.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
