The Mangaung Metro municipality says maintenance teams are working around the clock to restore water to affected areas in Bloemfontein. This after the recent heavy rainfalls have caused debris to block the flow of water from the Welbedacht dam. Mangaung Metro spokesperson Qondile Khedama says by midday many parts will have running water. He says they had to undertake serious purification and that process affected the supply of water. He says: “We have started putting more pressure on the line and some parts already have water like Louripark and Pellisier. The southern part of the city has been affected but we hope that by lunch time most of those areas should be getting water again.” Khedama adds that water tanks are being distributed to the southern parts of the city.
