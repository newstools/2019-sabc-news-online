The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has called on the National Transport Ministry to intervene in the ongoing taxi conflict in Hout Bay. This follows the death of five people over the past few days in suspected clashes over routes. ANC Spokesperson for Transport, Cameron Dugmore, says a joint approach is needed to address the conflict. “What has happened is that there has been an illegal rank created in the area and some of the operators operating between Cape Town and Hout Bay without permits. So, it is very important that there is consistent law enforcement working together with the police.” Some residents of Imizamo Yethu, in Hout Bay, say the suspension of two taxi associations who were operating in the area, has made it difficult for them to get to work. They wait in long queues for MyCiti buses to get to their places of work. The associations were suspended from operating on routes between Hout Bay, Wynberg and Cape Town due to ongoing violence. Since Friday, five people have been shot and killed, allegedly due to a dispute over routes.
