The Public Servants Association (PSA) says it will recommend to its members that they accept the  offer tabled by the South African Revenue Service (SARS).  SARS workers have been on strike since last week Thursday. They are demanding among others an 11.4 % salary increase while SARS was offering 7%. Both unions will present the SARS offer to their members and respond to it by nine o’clock on Monday morning. “Definitely we are going to recommend to our members to take this deal. It can’t get better than this. We got more than what we bargained for. We believe our members will accept this offer. However it is still within their right to reject it but the chances of this deal being rejected are very slim,” says Tahir Maepa, PSA Spokesperson. Watch a related video below:
