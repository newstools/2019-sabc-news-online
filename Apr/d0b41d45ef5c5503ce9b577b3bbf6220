The Association of Mine workers and Construction Union(AMCU) will convene for another mass meeting to receive an update on some of the outstanding issues from it’s National Executive Committee. About 15 000 AMCU members downed tools in November last year at Driefontein, Kloof and Beatrix Sibanye’s mines. They are demanding higher wages after the mine signed a wage agreement with three other unions. AMCU’s Krister Janse van Rensburg says they are holding out on signing because they want R1 000 increase per year over three years. This is not the deal signed by the other unions. Van Rensburg says the mine can afford to sign for R1 000 over three years. He says the issue of inflation should not come into play because it just helps perpetuate the problem. He says miners, especially black miners have been exploited for many years and AMCU will continue to fight for economic justice. Watch interview below
