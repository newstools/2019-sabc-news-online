Freedom Under Law says more damning revelations may surface once the full report on suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi,  is released. Freedom Under Law responded to findings made in a leaked report  by retired Constitutional Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, which established that the pair is unfit to hold office in the NPA. The report details that the two had compromised integrity, lack leadership skills and have poor ethical standards. President Cyril Ramaphosa has asked Jiba and Mrwebi to make submissions in response to the findings. Freedom Under Law CEO, Nicole Fritz, says  they don’t believe there will be substantial information to prompt the President to allow them to resume their role. “I think there are finings and information that is more damning still that many of us have so far seen. I can’t see how they are going to provide information in response to the findings made against them. They’ve had these opportunities and they were invited to make submissions to the President last August as to why they shouldn’t be suspended. And once the enquiry has established they were invited to make submissions, which they did, and the findings have now been made.” LISTEN BELOW: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/681347">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
