The founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo Joseph Shabalala is in high spirits. That’s according to ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa. He visited the ailing 77 year old musician at his home in Ladysmith on Saturday morning. The former leader of the multi-award winning Isicamithaya group has been ill for sometime. He retired in 2017 and withdrew from public engagements. Paying Shabalala a courtesy visit, president Ramaphosa said it was important to honour the country’s music icons. Ladysmith Black Mambazo has performed on the global stage and collaborated with musicians such as Dolly Parton and Paul Simon. Next year it will be 60 years since the Ladysmith Black Mambazo was formed. Ramaphosa says the singer is in good health and that he was happy to he hosted by the legend. “And for South Africa, we honour this group, we applaud them and we feel proud that they are one of our own and South African made products that travels all over the world. Well, our visit here adds to the honour and respect that we give in South Africa to legends like baba uShabalala and he sang for us and it also sang for him. So we as South Africans have to keep on applauding people like ubaba uShabalala and the group as well. This is the longest group performing in the whole world,” explains Ramaphosa. The family says Shabalala was honoured by the visit. Family member, Sbongiseni Shabalala says their father is overjoyed by the visit and had been anticipating it. He says his father’s health is also improving. Ladysmith Black Mambazo is soon leaving for Europe for a series of concerts. The group still has the world at its feet.
