African National Congress Emalahleni Regional Chairperson and Mayor Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba has been granted bail of R20 000 by the Emadadeni Magistrates’ Court in KwaZulu-Natal. Mahlaba is facing four charges including murder, attempted murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. The charges are in relation to the killing of ANC Youth League Emalahleni region deputy chair, Wandile Ngubeni in May 2016. At the start of the court proceedings on Monday morning, the state indicated that it would not oppose bail. Mahlaba’s next court appearance will be at the end of April.
