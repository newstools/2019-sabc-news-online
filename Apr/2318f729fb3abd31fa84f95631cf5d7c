King Sabatha Dalindyebo (KSD) municipal mayor in the Eastern Cape, Dumani Zozo, has resigned. This comes after amid calls from unions South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) and Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (IMATU) for his removal, accusing him of corruption, maladministration and misuse of funds. The municipality has been in turmoil for the past six months with SAMWU and IMATU workers on strike. African National Congress (ANC) provincial leaders have visited the area. Provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukaitobi says they welcome Zozo’s resignation. “The ANC in the Eastern Cape welcomes the resignation of Zozo as the executive mayor of the KSD municipality. We wish and think that this gives us an opportunity for the renewal and unity of that particular municipality, for the purpose of better servicing the community around,” says Ngcukaitobi.
