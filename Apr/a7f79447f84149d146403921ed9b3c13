Former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head, Robert McBride, has testified that the SA Police Service (SAPS) runs on a patronage system. Testifying before the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg, he says officers are promoted to high level positions in exchange for favours from superiors. McBride says promotions are given to officials who will help facilitate and conceal fraud and corruption. The former IPID boss’s testimony has been related to the weakening of the independence of the police service including the police watchdog, IPID. “It’s a system that has not been challenged. It’s a system on its own and it affects all aspects of our lives.” LISTEN BELOW: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/677318">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>  WATCH THE LIVE STREAM OF MCBRIDE’S TESTIMONY AT THE STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY ON TUESDAY…
