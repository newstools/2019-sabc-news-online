South African Communist Party (SACP) General-Secretary Blade Nzimande has called on the ruling party to act decisively with corruption in state owned entities. Nzimande was speaking at the commemoration of 26th anniversary of the assassination of SACP leader, Chris Hani who was assassinated in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg. It is an annual event to remember the role played by Chris Hani in the fight against apartheid. “We want ANC government to clean state owned enterprises. We do not have electricity today because of theft. We want the government to invest on Eskom; and Eskom must participate in clean renewable energy.” zima Hani was shot and killed on this day in 1993. His assassination is being remembered at a wreath laying ceremony in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. The SACP first general secretary, Solly Mapaila says this is a time that all alliance partners unite behind the African National Congress in these general elections.  Speaking at South Park Cemetery in Ekurhuleni, Gauteng, where the commemoration took place,  Nzimande has also condemned as anti-intellectual acts, the disruption of the the launch of investigative journalist Pieter-Louis Myburgh’s book. Protesters wearing African National Congress T-shirts stormed the Exclusive Books store in Sandton where the book titled; Unravelling Ace Magashule’s web of capture was launched on Tuesday night.
