Four suspects linked to the alleged burning of the provincial offices of the Department of Agriculture in the North West in Mahikeng are expected to appear at the Molopo Magistrates Court today. They were arrested last week Monday. They allegedly torched the HODs offices after accusing some departmentâ€™s high ranking officials of occupying some commercial farms, obtained through the land reform programs. During the incident, nine people, who are employees of the department, were reported to have inhaled smoke and were admitted in hospital. They were released the next day. All the suspects are expected to formally apply for bail on Thursday.
