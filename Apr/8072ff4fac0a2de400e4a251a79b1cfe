Gauteng Premier David Makhura says he has received a memorandum from the committee which organised the recent total shutdown protest in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. Residents embarked on sporadic protests last week over the mushrooming of illegal structures and service delivery failures.  On Monday, they marched to the City of Johannesburg’s Sandton office to hand over their memorandum. Speaking in Alexandra, Makhura confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the community’s concerns on Thursday.  Makhura says there will be an audit of the Alexandra Renewal Project. “The provincial government will be able to demonstrate every budget that we put into the Alexandra Renewal Project, what we did in this area – we built schools, clinic and houses.”  “We will be able to demonstrate that. I would also expect that the City of Johannesburg’s (COJ) will also be able to demonstrate how much money they put into the Alexandra Renewal Project (ARP) and account for every cent that was spent.”
