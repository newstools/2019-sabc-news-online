The Nelson Mandela Foundation has accused lobby group AfriForum of exploiting farm murders and creating a platform for the displaying of the old apartheid flag. The Foundation is presenting its arguments in the Equality Court in Johannesburg. It is seeking an order to declare the gratuitous display of the old flag unconstitutional. The Foundation argues that the continued display of the old flag constitutes harassment, unfair discrimination and hate speech. Arguing on behalf of the Foundation, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi says the gratuitous display of the old flag represents racial discrimination and a flagrant disregard for the manner in which black people suffered during the apartheid era. He says they argue in their court papers that they’re against the display of the old flag, but never condemned the act, or have it taken down during their Black Monday protest in 2017. He has also questioned why the group is opposing the Foundation’s application if it says it acknowledges that the flag has the capacity to cause offense and emotional distress. Watch for more:
