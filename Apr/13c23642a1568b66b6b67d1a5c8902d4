The Independent Communications Authority (Icasa) says it will take legal action against the Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams to release with immediate effect R450 million in funding that is due to the regulator. Icasa had given the Minister a deadline of 11:am earlier on Monday to pay one of the four instalments of its annual budget. She has missed the deadline. Acting Chairperson Dr Kea Modimoeng addresses the media in Pretoria, saying: “The council of the authority notes with serious concern that Icasa’s first payment has been unlawfully withheld by the Department of Communications even though the National Treasury has already released the budget allocation for the 2019/20 financial year as approved by Parliament.”
