Three disgruntled African National Congress (ANC) members in the Free State are taking the party and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to court to have names of 41 candidates nominated at the provincial list conference nullified. They say the ANC Provincial List Conference held in December in 2018 to nominate 11 members to the National Assembly and 30 to the Provincial Legislature was unlawful and unconstitutional. The matter will be heard on an urgent basis in the Gauteng South High Court on Tuesday. The list comprises of 30 names which includes the current Premier of the province, Sisi Ntombela. But acting ANC Spokesperson Dakota Legoete says the case is a waste of time as these members had enough time to raise their concerns with the ANC long before the list was sent to the IEC. “We’ve received an application from members of the ANC in the Free State, who challenging the PEC List Conference. We will go to court with them to defend the case. Because as the National African Congress we are confident that court will help us. “The List processes in the province were held last year in December. Then in January we had a National List Conference of which it was endorsed and adopted by the NEC. I think these members are ill-advised because the matter that they are raising has to with the electoral processes.”
