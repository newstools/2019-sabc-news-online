China has kicked off their 70th anniversary in of its independence in style. This, as the Chinese people and other foreign internationals took part in the Beijing International Walking Festival over the weekend. The event was organised by the Beijing NGO Association for International Exchanges, in conjunction with the People’s Government of China. Sky Lee, member of LookWorld Education Company, says it’s a very important year for China. “This event coincides with China’s independence anniversary celebrations and we saw it fit to celebrate by doing something much more positive. Good health is wealth hence we chose to have this walking festival in which people from all walks of life in China and abroad can take part and get healthier in the process,” says Lee. “Personally, I also donated books to a school in the mountains of because I believe the best gift you can give to children is education and instilling a sense of hard work towards their own success. We also invited international students to this event to share this message of love. As different nations, we also have a lot to learn from one another and we need to learn that love is the most important thing.” Book donation by Sky Lee In October 1949, China became fully independent when the country’s Communist leader Mao Zedong declared the creation of the People’s Republic of China. This ended the civil war between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Nationalist Party, which had broken out after the World War II. Xu Qiang, the NGO’s Secretary General, says they would like to grow the event. “This is our 10th year and we are looking to grow the event into what we call the three W’s – Walk World Wide Federation. Through walking we could unite people, and through that we could exchange ideas to make the world a better place and promote social and economic development in the world. That’s our vision.”
