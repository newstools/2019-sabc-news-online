President Cyril Ramaphosa says he hopes that the SABC Board will be able to provide the necessary and strategic support to the public broadcaster and its employees. He has congratulated the candidates after appointing them on Thursday to fill eight vacancies. The appointment of the candidates comes after the National Assembly passed a resolution recommending the appointment of the candidates. Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko says, “The President has wished this new board well as they execute their responsibility, understanding that they have a critical role to play in seeking to stabilise the organisation, especially during this critical time as our country advance to the elections.” “The SABC has gone through a tumultuous period where its finances were extremely challenged and its resources to be able to execute its public mandate were not efficient to allow it to do so effectively. So, the president hopes that this board will be able to provide the necessary strategic guidance and support to the SABC and all its employees.” Related video click below for more on the story:
