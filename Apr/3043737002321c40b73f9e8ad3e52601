More than 50 drivers have been arrested for alleged reckless and drunken driving during the Easter period in Limpopo. At least 18 people have lost their lives on the province’s roads so far. Transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje says they are delighted that there is a reduction of road deaths compared to the same time last year where more than 30 people died. He says: “Our traffic officers have worked tirelessly throughout the Easter weekend. There were a number of people who were arrested in terms of drunken and driving and there were number of people who were arrested driving recklessly. Even though one life is too many but us achieving a reduction in terms of fatalities as well as crashes makes us really proud.” Meanwhile, traffic is moving smoothly on both N1 and R101 road in Limpopo. Holidaymakers, ZCC and Saint Engenas pilgrims are traveling to various parts of the country after spending the long Easter weekend at church services. One of the motorists says: “For now, it is still fine we didn’t have any problems coming from Moria. The traffic is flowing, no accidents, everything is going and well traffic officers are doing a good job.”
