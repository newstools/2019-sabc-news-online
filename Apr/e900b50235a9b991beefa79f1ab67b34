Former Free State Economic Development MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana, has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that he believed the Free State government would not cooperate with his request for information without a court order. He says that he applied for the Bloemfontein High Court intervention to ensure that he received the supporting documents for the submissions he would make to the Commission. Dukwana was allegedly offered a R2-million bribe by the Gupta family after being taken to the Gupta compound by then Free State Premier, Ace Magashule. Click on videos below:
