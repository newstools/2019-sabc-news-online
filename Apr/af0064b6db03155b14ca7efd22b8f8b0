Repair work to the busy M2 highway will be completed by October, Johannesburg City Mayor Herman Mashaba announced this during his third State of the City Address. Residents have been forced to bypass this key section of the highway, causing great inconvenience to residents and businesses alike. But Mashaba says the work was necessary. “I stood on that bridge. I felt the vibrations and I saw first-hand the cracks in the supporting structure. There’s no doubt that this was a lifesaving and very necessary decision. “The emergency repairs on this bridge are said to be finished by October of this year and I’m very pleased by the offers from the private sector that have come forward with offering time, funding and expertise to expedite the completion of this project,” Mashaba explains.
