The Mpumalanga Department of Health says it is moving towards the right direction in the fight against the tuberculosis (TB) pandemic. This comes after  50% reduction of the number of people who were diagnosed with TB between 2011 and 2018 in the province. Speaking during the provincial World TB Day commemoration at Emalahleni, Health MEC Sasekani Manzini, says one of the challenges that they are faced with is that some people default from the treatment. For the past three years, the Ehlanzeni District has been recording the highest number of people infected with TB. MEC for Health, Sasekani Manzini, says dedicated workers at the four TB Specialised hospitals in the province have played a crucial role to reduce the pandemic. Manzini addressed the World TB Day commemoration held at the Witbank TB Hospital. “We have managed to make sure that all our facilities be it your clinic, be it your hospital all of them we are able to test all our patients in terms of TB. So we encourage our people in the province to make sure that when you are coughing for more than two hours don’t try to give yourself medication but go to the nearest clinic so that if you go there they will be able to detect early and you will be able to get treatment.”   Residents have called on the Department of Health to build more TB Specialised health facilities.
