President Cyril Ramaphosa has given senior National Prosecuting Authority officials, advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi until Tuesday next week for them to consider the report on their fitness to hold office and make recommendations. Ramaphosa established the inquiry in October 2018 and placed Advocates Jiba and Mrwebi on suspension with full pay pending the finalisation of the inquiry. Retired Constitutional Court Judge Yvonne Mokgoro led the inquiry into duo’s fitness to hold office and compiled the report which she submitted to Ramaphosa. The President says the report will only be made public after he has considered the two advocates’ representations. Watch a related video below:
