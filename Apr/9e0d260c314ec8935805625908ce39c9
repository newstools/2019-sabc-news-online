The Cape Town Weather Office says strong gale force winds in the Mother City are expected to subside on Tuesday. Senior weather forecaster, Kate Turner, says wind speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour have been recorded in some parts of the metro. She says moderate temperatures in the mid-twenties have also been forecast for the next few days. “Over the Cape Metropole and over the Cape surrounding areas, very windy still, reaching about 50-60 kilometres an hour, but by Wednesday things will start to drop down and look a lot better.” “It’s quite a mild week that’s lying ahead of us. Our temperatures remaining in the mid-twenties and that would be from tomorrow [Wednesday] right through to the end of the week as well, those temperatures in our mid-twenties,” adds Turner.
