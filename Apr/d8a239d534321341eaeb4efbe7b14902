Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, will on Thursday face another motion of no confidence vote in a council meeting in Port Elizabeth. This is the third motion against Bobani since his party, the United Democratic Movement (UDM), together with the African National Congress (ANC), African Independent Congress (AIC) and United Democratic Front (UDF) supported by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) ousted former Mayor, the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Athol Trollip in 2018. The motion has been tabled by Patriotic Alliance (PA) councillor, Marlon Daniels, and is supported by African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) councillor, Lance Grootboom. Marlon is accusing Bobani of neglecting poor communities. Bobani says he’s not moved by the motion. “It means that dogs bark at a moving car. It means that I’m doing a very good thing that people are challenging me. Opposition will always do that, they must come to the black caucus and ask the black caucus what is your strategy in terms of holding, in terms of ensuring that we are making a coup. We can advise them, but they are doing it wrong. Let’s wait for the council meeting and see how far they can go,” says Bobani.
