The bail application for three men accused of killing former ANC Youth League Secretary General Sindiso Magaqa has been postponed to Tuesday. This was after the magistrate presiding over the case was unavailable on Monday. The three also face two charges of attempted murder in the Umzimkhulu Magistrateâ€™s Court in KwaZulu-Natal. They were charged along with Harry Gwala District Municipality Mayor, Mluleki Ndobe and Umzimkhulu Municipal Manager Zweliphansi Skhosana whose charges were provisionally withdrawn in March.
