Three Britons and two individuals holding joint United States and British citizenship were among more than 200 people killed in the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka, the Press Association (PA) reported, citing the Sri Lankan foreign ministry. Bomb blasts ripped through churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday, killing 207 and injuring 450 people, police said, in the first major attack on the Indian Ocean Island since the end of a civil war 10 years ago. Two Turkish citizens were among the more than 200 killed in bomb blasts at three churches and four hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday, Turkey’s government said in state-run media on Sunday. The Turks were Serhan Narici and Yigit Cavus, engineers working on a project in Sri Lanka, Anadolu agency said, citing Turkey’s ambassador to Sri Lanka and its foreign ministry. “Unfortunately we lost our citizens…in the treacherous attacks in Sri Lanka,” Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a statement. Cavusoglu said the ministry was in contact with their families and it would ensure that the funerals were held in Turkey shortly. Several Americans were among the more than 200 people killed Sunday in a series of bombings of hotels and churches in Sri Lanka, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. “While many details of the attacks are still emerging, we can confirm that several US citizens were among those killed,” he said in a statement. “The US Embassy is working tirelessly to provide all possible assistance to the American citizens affected by the attacks and their families.” – Additional Reporting AFP
