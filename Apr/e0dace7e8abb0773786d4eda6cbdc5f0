The National Health, Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) at the Samsom Magomane branch in Limpopo is calling on Premier Stan Mathabatha to remove Director General Nape Nchabeleng from his position. Nehawu is holding lunch-hour pickets outside Mathabatha’s office. The union is accusing Nchabeleng of irregular expenditure in the 2015-2016 financial year amounting to R3.9 million. Chairperson of the branch, Norman Mavhunga says Mathabatha must also charge Nchabeleng. “The picketing is going to take place from today (Monday) until the executive authority takes a decision on charging the DG (Director General) or either the DG resigns if any other comes forward and one of the other reason we are pausing this is because the DG is running away from taking responsibilities over this misconduct and he wants to reduce salaries of workers as of 2014 to today. If you look at the exorbitant money that can be taken from each employee, it’s way too much.”
