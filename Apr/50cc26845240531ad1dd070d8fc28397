Suspended senior National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrance Mrwebi say they have not received communication from the Presidency regarding their possible axing from the NPA. This comes after media reports that the pair have been found unfit to hold office by the Mokgoro Enquiry. “It’s been a long journey, it’s been a very hectic journey, it’s been a painful journey as I said in my opening remarks but I’m really happy that it has come this far and the inquiry is now finished. I will just say I leave it in the hands of the judge and her co-panelist,” said Jiba at the conclusion of the Mokogoro Enquiry hearings. Cautiously optimistic at the time, but now the story seems different.  Widespread media reports on the leaked Mokgoro Enquiry final report suggest the end is near, alongside Advocate Mrwebi – the Special Director of Public Prosecution. The pair is reported to have been found unfit to hold office. They have been reportedly described by the Mokgoro Enquiry report to have compromised integrity, lack leadership and have poor ethical standards. The reported adverse findings against Advocates Jiba and Mrewbi relate to their handling of key criminal cases. This includes the controversial withdrawal of charges against former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli and the false authorisation of racketeering charges against former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks Head Johan Booysen. Earlier in the month President Cyril Ramaphosa asked both Jiba and Mrwebi to make submissions in response to the serious allegations levelled against them. Both parties have confirmed receiving the report and submitting their representations. Now they wait for the President’s final decision – a decision that may very well be the end of their NPA careers.
