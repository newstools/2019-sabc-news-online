Despite African leaders’ resolution to allow the ruling military council in Sudan more time to implement democratic reforms, the voice of protest is growing ever more loud in Sudan. Thousands of protestors continue their sit-in outside the defence ministry headquarters. They are demanding that the Transitional Military Council hands over power to civilians. The military council took over after President Omar al-Bashir was ousted two weeks ago. Piled onto the roof of a train or packed inside, hundreds of protestors mainly rail workers entered Khartoum to join the sit-in now in its third week.  Thousands of protestors, waving Sudanese flags, greeted them at Khartoum’s main station. The protests, which began in December were sparked by an attempt to raise bread prices amid a deepening economic crisis. They quickly turned against Bashir’s 30-year rule and spread to cities. The Military council says it wants to oversee a transitional period of up to two years, but is willing to work with a civilian government comprised of technocrats. African leaders meeting in Cairo under the current chairman of the African Union, Abdel Fattah al Sisi, gave the council three months to put in place democratic structures and hand over to a civilian government.
