The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) says the decision by the Labour Registrar to de-register it is a clear political attack on the union. Labour Department Registrar Lehlohonolo Molefe says the union is not operating according to its own constitution. This stems from AMCU’s failure to hold a national congress last year. The union’s constitution stipulates that it will hold an elective conference once every five years. But Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa says they are compliant with the Labour Relations Act and have kept in contact with the Registrar regarding their elective congress which was to be held this year. “Amcu remains in total compliance of the Labour Relations Act. The inconsistency of the Registrar when it comes to the deregistration of trade unions is a lot to be desired. There are numerous examples of trade unions and trade federations who have contravened major prescriptions including financial submissions. They were never deregistered or threatened with cancellation of registration. This is clearly a political agenda.” Speaking at media conference in Johannesburg on Friday, Mathunjwa has strongly defended the union’s decision to delay its national general congress, saying the NEC has decided to move it from May to September. “We are not moving away from the congress. Any organisation has got the right to postpone. It’s a power vested in the NEC. There’s a political agenda because we are a militant organisation.”
