A 32-year-old woman, who is accused of dumping her new-born baby girl in a stormwater drain in Newlands north of Durban, will appear in the Newlands Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday. She is facing a charge of attempted murder. The woman who cannot be named, to protect the identity of her three other children, is out on R5 000 bail. At her last appearance, the court said that a DNA test would be conducted to determine whether the accused is the biological mother of the baby that was found in the stormwater drain.
