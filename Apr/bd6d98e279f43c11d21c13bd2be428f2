The uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court is on Wednesday expected to hand down judgment in the bail application of three men arrested in connection with the killing of former ANC Youth League secretary-general, Sindiso Magaqa. The three were arrested along with Harry Gwala District Municipal Mayor, Mluleki Ndobe, and Umzimkhulu municipal manager, Zweliphansi Skhosana. However, the charges against Ndobe and Skhosana were provisionally withdrawn in March due to insufficient evidence. Former police officers Sabelo Myeza and Mlungisi Ncalane and businessman Mbulelo Mpofana face one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder of Jabulile Msiya and Nontsikelelo Mafa who sustained gunshot wounds on the day Magaqa was shot. The suspects had pleaded not guilty to all three counts and claim that the State’s case is weak. But the State says the three are linked through cell phone recordings. It is also alleged that they planned and executed Magaqa’s murder. Click video below:
