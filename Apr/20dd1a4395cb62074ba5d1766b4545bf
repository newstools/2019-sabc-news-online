The number of people killed in Mozambique by Cyclone Kenneth rose to five on Saturday (April 27), two days after it smashed into the country’s northern coast, according to the United Nations. Photographs shared by Mozambique Red Cross showed large trees lying uprooted on roads in the northeastern city of Pemba, a testament to the power of the second storm to hit the impoverished nation within six weeks. Heavy rains pounded Mozambique on Saturday, fuelling fears of a repeat of the flooding caused by March’s cyclone Idai in a region particularly prone to flooding and landslides. Kenneth killed three people in the Comoros before moving on to Mozambique, which is still struggling to cope with the impact Idai. Idai levelled the port city of Beira and brought floods that killed over 1,000 people across a swathe of southern Africa. WATCH RELATED VIDELO BELOW:
