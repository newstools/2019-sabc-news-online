Two learners from the Grace and Hope Special schools are on Monday expected to appear in the Seshego Magistrate’s Court outside Polokwane in Limpopo on a murder charge. They were arrested on Sunday following the death of a 12-year-old learner at the school’s hostel. In a statement released on Saturday, the Limpopo Education Department stated that the learner’s lifeless body was discovered after two of his classmates reported to the principal that he was no longer moving. Emergency services were then called in and upon arrival, the learner was declared dead. On Sunday, police confirmed that two learners aged 14 and 16 had been arrested and charged with murder. Authorities could however not reveal any information on how the learner came to meet his death stating that the matter was sensitive as it involved minors with intellectual disabilities.
