Organisers of the Tshwane shutdown in Pretoria are adamant that they are forging ahead with their planned protest on Monday. A poster with the logos of civic organisation SANCO and the ANC has been circulating on social media regarding a total shutdown of the city. However, the ANC in the city has distanced itself from the poster saying that the planned mass meeting is either spearheaded by rogue members of the community or one of the plots to discredit the party as the country heads to the elections. March organiser David Ratladi says they are against the municipality’s billing system. He says: “We are going towards three years being charged with estimates. How can you estimate a senior citizen’s bill, a child headed household or people who are not working at all and charge them with estimates.’ ‘People are are owing R300 000, R500 000 in the billing. Now they are threatening to auction their houses to recover the money. How dare you do that as a government to your people.”
