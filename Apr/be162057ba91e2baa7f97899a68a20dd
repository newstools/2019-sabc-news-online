South Africa’s consumer price inflation (CPI) rate for last month will be announced on Wednesday; with expectations for an increase to 4.6% from February’s 4.1%. This stays within the Reserve Bank’s target rate of inflation between 3% and 6%. The CPI rate in Zimbabwe rose to 66% year-on-year from 59% in February. The inflation rate has been rising since October last year when Zimbabwe ran out of dollars, mainly due to higher imports than exports. Botswana’s inflation rate on the other hand was 3.3% in March; the lowest inflation rate since September.
