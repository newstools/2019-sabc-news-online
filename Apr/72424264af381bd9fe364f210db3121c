The Democratic Alliance (DA) has won all three by-elections which took place in the Western Cape on Wednesday. The party has ousted the African National Congress (ANC) in ward 4 in the Hessequa Municipality with 57% of the vote.  The DA has also retained Ward 9 in Stellenbosch and Ward 18 in George, respectively with 98% and 74% of the vote. DA provincial leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, says the good performance is an indication of the DA’s growth in the Western Cape. “We are very humbled by this faith that has been shown by the voters to the DA and we are quite confident that come the 8th of May, we will retain the Western Cape with an increased majority. I want to thank all the activists and leaders who made sure that we continue to build one South Africa for all,” says Madikizela. Watch a related video below:
