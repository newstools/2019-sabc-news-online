The case against a man and a woman arrested for the fake resurrection of 29-year-old Brighton Moyo at Alleluia Ministries International has been postponed to May 16. The pair appeared before the Johannesburg Magistratesâ€™ Court earlier on Friday. The case has been postponed for further investigations and for the state to obtain outstanding cellphone records. 40-year-old Silungisani Sibanda and 35-year-old Nkululeko Dlamini were arrested earlier this month and have been charged with fraud. They allegedly posed as funeral undertakers when pastor Alph Lukau proclaimed the resurrection sham at his church in Sandton in February. Moyo a Zimbabwean national, reportedly died in his home country earlier this month. Both suspects will remain in custody until their next appearance. WATCH BELOW:
