A fire broke out on two trains at the Cape Town train station on Sunday afternoon.  Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse, says the cause of the fire is unknown at this stage. ” The City of Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue Services responded to a train alight at Cape Town train station.
