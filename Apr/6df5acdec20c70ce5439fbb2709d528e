Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, the Reverend Thabo Makgoba, says South Africans cannot solely rely on changes in the presidency to turn the country around. He was delivering an Easter sermon at St George’s Cathedral. Makgoba says South Africans face a new struggle about values and institutions rather than personalities. He says the country needs to build strong systems which cannot be undermined by one person or any political party. The Archbishop said institutions need to be strengthened for government to improve the lives of the poor. Makgoba says the judiciary has performed well over the past decade while the executive has begun to perform better. He however, added that Parliament has failed abysmally over the years to hold government to account. He’s also cited the behaviour of some MP’s as disgraceful.
