African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela Bay councillor, Andile Lungisa says his legal team will challenge the dismissal of his appeal bid against his conviction and sentence at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. The Grahamstown High Court in Makhanda dismissed his appeal after his sentencing for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm by the Port Elizabeth High Court in 2018. This was after he smashed a glass jug over the head of former member of the mayoral committee, Rano Kayser, during a heated 2016 council meeting. Lungisa says, “We are disappointed, but we will take the matter up to Bloemfontein because we were convinced when we were in Grahamstown that we will be able to win.” “Our legal team made clear arguments which were in line terms of the law but obviously the judges has their own decisions that we respect but we are taking the matter to Bloemfontein, we have read the judgement and the judgement has got serious gaps and is not consistent and that is why we are taking the matter to the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein.” Related video click below:
