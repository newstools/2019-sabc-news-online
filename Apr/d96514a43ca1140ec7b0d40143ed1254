Eleven children between the ages of three months and 18 years are set to undergo surgery to reconstruct deformed noses, ears and cleft pallets, at Tygerberg Hospital this week. The Smile Foundation is assisting the children with the operation. The foundation is an NGO that assists children with facial abnormalities. Tygerberg Hospital CEO, Hedley Lewis says, “The eleven surgeries will be taking place over the next few days in order to change children’s lives to support their families and to enhance South Africa. “We are excited by the fact that the Tygerberg Hospital steps up and continues with a mission and vision of changing children’s lives,” explained Lewis.
