Schooling has been disrupted in several schools in Soweto, south of Johannesburg, after learners were removed from classes by members of  Congress of South African Students (Cosas). The organisation wants the learners to take part in a march to Luthuli House in the Johannesburg CBD. Cosas is raising concerns over the sexual assault of learners by teachers and the need for the provision of sanitary towels in schools. Grade 9 learners, Temosho Rakgogo and Kgontse Segona from Moletsane Secondary School chose not to take part in the action. “I agree with some of the reasons why they are protesting because there are teachers that do wrongs things to learners and those learners keep quiet. But we could be learning and we’re losing time and this term is short. You could find that where they are going is dangerous and for us girls, I see going there as a risk. There is no supervision.”
