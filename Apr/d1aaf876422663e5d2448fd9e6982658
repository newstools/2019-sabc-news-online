Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, says the provincial government is doing its best to undo the legacy of apartheid’s spatial planning when it comes to human settlements. She was speaking in New Woodlands in Mitchell’s Plain where she launched a multi-million rand housing project. Zille, together with provincial Minister for Human Settlements, Bonginkosi Madikizela and City of Cape Town Mayco Member for Human Settlements, Malusi Booi, officiated at the sod turning event. The project, estimated to be worth over R200 million, is intended to yield more than 400 housing housing opportunities for both the residents of New Woodlands and Kosovo in Philippi. Zille says by integrating these communities government is showing it’s serious about delivering a better life for the people of the province. The New Woodlands project also forms part of the Southern Corridor Integrated Human Settlements Program.
