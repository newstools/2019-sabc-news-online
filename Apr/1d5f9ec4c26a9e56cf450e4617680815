Seven suspects arrested in connection with the much-publicised murder of Polokwane man Thorisho Themane are now out on bail. Family of the deceased have expressed disappointment after the men were granted R2000 bail each. Themane was killed allegedly by a group of teenagers in Polokwane two months ago. This is the fourth postponement since the case was brought to court and the state did not oppose this latest bail application. Initially two adult suspects were granted R1000 bail each. One of the bail conditions demands that suspects stay out of Polokwane for safety reasons. Although deeply disappointed, family of the deceased says it still has faith in the justice system. Themane family spokesperson, Kevin Pohotona says, “It’s very sad but I must also say that our spirits are still high. We have faith in the proceedings; we lobby for people to be on board with and continue in this story. We will get to the bottom of it. Post mortem, everything compiled will bring us a conclusion which is fair and just.” Police are disappointed that the Polokwane Children’s Court has granted bail to the minors. The teen suspects aged between 13 and 17 years old are pupils at various schools in Polokwane. Part of the bail conditions are that they must be transferred from their schools and continue their studies outside Polokwane.  General Nneke Ledwaba says police were ready to oppose bail, but the magistrate ordered them to leave the courtroom. “That is something that does not make me happy. From the police we have done our job. Murder is one; schedule six offenses that is not easy for a person to be given a bail. But I understand there is a constitutional mandate or they have got that policy that says yes they qualify to be given bail. From our side, I am saying and I was saying and I indicated this morning – no for them to get bail.”
