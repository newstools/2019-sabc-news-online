The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) government says national government needs to begin to address the threat of climate change and work towards ensuring the safety of the nation. The province is struggling to recover from the devastating floods that struck the Durban metro and other parts of the province last week. Seventy people have been confirmed dead, two are missing and more than 1000 displaced. President Cyril Ramaphosa had earlier attributed the floods to the effects of climate change. The cost of damages is estimated to be over R1 billion. The KZN Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube says a summit on climate change needs to be held as soon as possible. “We have to start getting prepared so we looking at things such as insurance, what could be some of the mitigating activities that we need to start with such as insuring that people that are already profiled as living in the flood plains, informal buildings that are in the areas next to the rivers that usually breaks their banks and causes this flooding as well as the loss to life. All those issues now need to be looked at quickly. We have even suggested that we want to hold a climate change summit immediately,” says Dube-Ncube. Watch a related video below:
