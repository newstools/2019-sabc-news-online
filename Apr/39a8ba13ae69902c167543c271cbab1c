The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says it is disappointed by the results of three by-elections held in the province on Wednesday. The party lost control of ward four in the Hessequa Municipality to the Democratic Alliance (DA). The ward became vacant when the ANC councillor passed away. The DA retained Ward 9 in Stellenbosch and ward 18 in George. “The valuable lesson we have learned is that we must redouble our efforts to get our voters out to polling stations so that they can vote. So now, we’ll focus on what went wrong and how to improve,” says ANC provincial spokesperson, Dennis Cruywagen.
