Gun Free South Africa says the destruction of seized and surrendered firearms should happen more regularly if the police want to curb the flow of unlicensed guns in the country. The organisation was commenting ahead of the planned destruction of over 30 000 firearms on Wednesday. The weapons were seized during police operations. The last such destruction took place in October 2016. The destruction will be witnessed by Police Minister Bheki Cele and National Commissioner Kehla Sithole. Researcher at Gun Free SA Claire Taylor says, “Gun free SA welcomes today’s (Wednesday’s) destruction and we would call for more regular destructionS. We have also made a submission to the police urging that there be independent verification of this and future destructions to ensure that the guns that are listed to be destroyed today (Wednesday) are in fact still in police stores and that they are destroyed. Not only will this ensure that guns can’t leak from police stores into communities but will also build confidence in the police that they are going to destroy guns if the public wants to hand them in.”
