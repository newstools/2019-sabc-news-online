The Democratic Alliance(DA) in KwaZulu-Natal has called on government to deploy the SANDF to help with rescue operations in the province. Over 60 people have been confirmed dead after heavy rains caused flooding and mudslides. DA KwaZulu-Natal premier candidate, Zwakele Mncwango, says he believes that the army is best equipped to help with rescue operations. He says: “We believe that the deployment of the army with immediate effect will help the province and assist in rescue operations.” “We do understand that our province and Ethekwini municipality especially don’t have enough resources and capabilities to assist. We are aware that despite having lost 51 people, there are many uncounted people who are still out there after the flooding. For that reason, we believe that this is a matter of emergency.”
