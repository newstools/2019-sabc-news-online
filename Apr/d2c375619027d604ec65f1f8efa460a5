A new study has found that South African companies have started to take gender transformation more seriously. Executive firm Jack Hammer conducted the study which shows that for the first time more women than men landed management and leading roles last year. The firm says 52% roles that opened were filled by women. “Well, it means that companies are setting up and putting transformation high on the agenda. We’ve seen a steady increase in the number of female appointment over the past few years. It was about 26% in 2015. And that number in fact did double in 2018 to 52%; and the fact that the number of women appointed has now exceeded the number of men is very good news,” says Chief Operations Officer of Jack Hammer, Advaita Naidoo.
