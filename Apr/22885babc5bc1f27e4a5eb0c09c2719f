Residents of Phola in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga are accusing the local mines of causing cracks into their houses when blasting. The residents told Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, when he visited the area for an inspection on the impact of the mines in the community. Mantashe visited the community and four mines operating nearby, after the residents raised concerns last weekend. To many of the residents of Phola, the mines operating nearby are a hope for job opportunities. However, to some home owners the mines are a thorn in the flesh. Some homeowners complain of cracks developing in their houses. They blame the mines for the cracks. They also claim to be acquiring sicknesses as a result of air pollution emitted by the mines. Some say the ceiling of their houses have collapsed. According to Mantashe, a technical assessment team will be sent to establish whether the cracks are caused by the mines or are a result of poor workmanship. “It needs technical assessment whether it is cracks out of blasting or not but its quite a distance from the mine. Because it is a mine we need to make a distinction whether its cracks are from the mine or poor workmanship.” Mantashe also interacted with the residents at the community hall. He said the report of the assessment team will give a clear direction on action to be taken.
