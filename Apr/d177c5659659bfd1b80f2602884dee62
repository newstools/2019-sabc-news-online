Former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Johan Booysen is expected to continue with his evidence at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Thursday. Booysen is giving evidence into how law enforcement agencies were captured in the province. He detailed how top ranking police officers and the former Kwazulu-Natal police commissioner, Mmamonnye Ngobeni interfered and tried to stop an investigation into a politically connected businessman following irregularities into procurement processes during the 2010 Soccer World Cup. He said the commissioner was at the centre of trying to protect a corrupt businessman from facing the law. Booysen also implicated Ngobeni in a R2-million bribe he was offered by police colonel, Navin Padhoe. Booysen said he continued with his investigation despite a direct order from the provincial commissioner to stop his investigation against businessman, Toshan Panday. The policeman was arrested as he didnâ€™t realise that Booysen was working undercover with the National Director of Public Prosecutions. Watch the video below for more:
