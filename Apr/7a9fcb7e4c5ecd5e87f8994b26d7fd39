As Cyclone Kenneth is making landfall in northern Mozambique, disaster management teams in KwaZulu-Natal are keeping a close eye on the situation in the province. The provincial Cooperative Governance spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso,  says they have not received any reports of further damage after heavy thunderstorms in the far northern parts of the province late on Thursday. “We had Cyclone Idai which was also in Mozambique. We had thought that we had escaped it as the province of KZN. Little did we know that we were not completely out of the woods. But we are hoping that Mother Nature will spare us, and allow us an opportunity to mourn and also support each other and recover from the latest incident.” International Relations Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, is expected to visit flood victims in Durban on Friday together with a group of business people to hand over relief aid. They are expected to visit victims in Umlazi and Clermont. Lennox Mabaso says incidents of flood damage have now been reported in 80 of the eThekwini metro’s wards while search and mopping up operations continue. Disaster relief teams will also be reaching out to places where smaller numbers of displaced people are being sheltered. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
