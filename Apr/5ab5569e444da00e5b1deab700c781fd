The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) is currently investigating human rights violations in Alexandra. Residents of the township have been protesting what they believe is a lack of service delivery as well as the mushrooming of informal settlements. Following the protests, the SAHRC saw it fit to investigate the living conditions in the area. The commission is set to meet with Mayor Herman Mashaba who has said he will only be meeting with the community on April 15. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/675153">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
