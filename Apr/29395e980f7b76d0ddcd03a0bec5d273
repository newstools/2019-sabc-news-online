Egyptians voted on Monday  for the third and final day on whether to back constitutional amendments that could see President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stay in power until 2030. The three-day referendum was called last week, a day after Egypt’s parliament overwhelmingly endorsed the proposals, which would also bolster the role of the military and expand the president’s power over judicial appointments. Sisi’s supporters argue that he has stabilized the country and Egypt’s needs more time to reform the economy, but critics say they fear that the changes will stifle debate. While the changes are expected to pass, observers say the turnout will be a test of Sisi’s popularity, which has been dented by austerity measures since 2016. He was re-elected last year with 97 percent of the votes. Proponents of the changes have argued that Sisi, a former army chief, came to power with a huge mandate after mass protests in 2013 against Islamist President Mohamed Mursi’s one year in office. With the economy improving, they say Sisi deserves more time to build on reforms. Those who oppose the proposals say a central promise of the 2011 uprising that toppled then-President Hosni Mubarak is at risk: the principle of the peaceful transfer of power.
