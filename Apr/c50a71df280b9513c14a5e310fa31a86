Mayor Herman Mashaba has abandoned his attempt to address the community of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. Protesters prevented Mashaba from addressing the crowd at the Malboro Community Hall, north of Johannesburg, by singing and refusing to cooperate with City officials. Mashaba was expected to address community members over their concerns since they started protesting two weeks ago. The residents have been complaining about the mushrooming of illegal structures in the township, as well as the lack of service delivery.
