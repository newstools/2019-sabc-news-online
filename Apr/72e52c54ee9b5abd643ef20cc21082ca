The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro has taken full responsibility for the tragic death of a 21-month-old baby girl who drowned in a rain-filled ditch at the Vastrap informal settlement in Port Elizabeth. It’s alleged that Mishka Ferreira wandered off her home and drowned in a ditch left by a construction company since last year. Her devastated father, Emille Vansensie, says there are no words to describe his loss. He blames the metro and the contractor for not securing the ditch. “I cannot even explain what I feel, because I feel for my daughter. She is not here anymore, for whom will I say bye to in the morning? I’m a guard in the taxi industry. For whom will I say bye and sing with?”  WATCH BELOW:
