Police are disappointed that the Polokwane Children’s Court has granted bail to seven minors who allegedly killed 28-year-old Thorisho Themane in February. The teen suspects aged between 13 and 17, who are learners at various schools in Polokwane, were each given bail of R2 000 on Wednesday. Part of the bail conditions is that they must be transferred from their schools and continue their studies outside Polokwane. General Nneke Ledwaba says police were ready to oppose bail, but the Magistrate ordered them to leave the courtroom. Ledwaba says: “This is something that does not make me happy. As police we have done our job and murder is a schedule six offence that should make it not easy for a person to be given bail.” “But I understand there is a Constitutional mandate or they have got that policy that says yes they qualify to be given bail. From our side I indicated that there should be no bail for them.” Related Video
