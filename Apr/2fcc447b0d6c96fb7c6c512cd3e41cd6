The wife of killed cyclist Andrew Randall has called on the motorist, who drove into her husband and his fellow cyclists, to hand himself over to the police. Randall was killed on Friday morning and two others injured when a speeding motorist crashed into the group on the R55 Road in Centurion, south of Pretoria. The driver fled the scene, leaving his passenger in the car. He is still on the run. An emotional Tracy Randall wants, the motorist who killed the father of her two children, to be brought to book. “When I woke up this morning, there were more news coming through that they’ve gone to the house and couldn’t find him. And yes I will just request that person to come forward and say sorry for having made a mistake. It’s just devastating and if I could just find closure on it as soon as possible so that we can continue with our lives because we won’t be able to put anything behind us. We won’t be able to forget Andrew.” Tshwane police and traffic authorities are also calling on the driver to turn himself in. Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says they know the man’s identity and have launched a manhunt for him. “If he doesn’t, definitely we are on his heels, we are following the leads. I can safely confirm that we have obtained the address. We visited the address, he was not found at his premise, but definitely we are looking for him.”
