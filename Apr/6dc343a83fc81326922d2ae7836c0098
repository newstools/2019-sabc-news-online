Police have removed rocks and tree branches that were used to block roads in some parts of Mabopane and Soshanguve, in Tshwane, Monday morning.   This comes after community members in Mabopane, Soshanguve and Ga-Rankuwa vowed to bring the City to its knees following their unhappiness on the issuing of titles deeds, high electricity and water costs and the lack of services delivery among other things. Marchers are expected to gather at the Old Putco Depot in Marabastad. Some school pupils say they were told by their teachers not to come to school. Itâ€™s estimated that about 12 000 people will take part in the planned march. There has been several service delivery protests in parts of Gauteng as the country nears the highly anticipated general elections on May 08. The marchers are expected to deliver their memorandum at the Union Buildings at 10:00am. Tshwane Metro Police has advised motorists to make alternative arrangements as several streets will be closed.
