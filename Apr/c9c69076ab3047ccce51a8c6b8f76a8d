The steepest petrol price increase in four years will take effect at midnight on Wednesday.Â The petrol price will go up by R1.34, diesel by R0.82 cents and illuminating paraffin by R0.63 per litre. The increase in fuel prices follows rising oil prices and a weakening rand and also compounded by the rise in fuel taxes announced by Finance minister Tito Mboweni in February. Electricity prices are also increasing with Eskom customers to pay 14% more for power from today and municipal customers will pay a similar amount more from July, 1st.  Click on video below:
