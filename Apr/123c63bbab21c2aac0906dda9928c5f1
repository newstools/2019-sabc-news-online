The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) has called on the public to adopt penguin eggs as part of its hatch programme to help its conservation efforts. The Chick Rearing Unit at the newly refurbished facility in Cape Town is busier than ever hatching abandoned African Penguin eggs. Rehabilitation Manager, Nicky Stander, says nearly 20 eggs have been hatched so far and about 200 more are expected to arrive at the centre over the next four months. Stander says the ‘adopt an egg’ programme is really special to their organisation. “I think someone can gift that to somebody and it can also make a difference to our organisation, to the species as well. So for R300 someone can adopt an egg, they can give it as a birthday present or for Easter, however appropriate and they would really be making a difference,” says Stander.
