More than 500 people have been evacuated to places of safety in Bronville, in Welkom. Many children could not go to school as roads are also flooded. Bronville and Chris Hani primary schools have also been flooded. Emergency services including police are assisting vehicles that are stuck on the flooded roads. Premier of the Free State, Sisi Ntombela who is in Welkom accompanied by various MEC’s says the area should be declared a disaster area. “All the departments are on their way to come to Welkom. I’ve called all the departments so that all of us must sit down and see what it is we can do. But unfortunately I’ve just received another call that in Marquard it is now very bad, the river has burst its banks so it’s even worse than here, so I must now rush to Marquard and leave the other MEC’s here and go to Marquard to see what we can do.” Mayor of Matjhabeng, Nkosinjani Speelman says areas that have been affected by floods include Thabong, Virginia, Allenridge and Ventersburg. Speelman says some areas of Matjhabeng could be declared disaster areas.
