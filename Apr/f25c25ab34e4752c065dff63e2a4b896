Acting government communications head, Phumla Williams, says Deputy President David Mabuza gave a verbal briefing to cabinet about his work on the Special Cabinet Committee on Eskom. Williams says Mabuza regularly gives verbal reports that are then included in the cabinet statements issued to the public. Earlier, Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Natasha Mazzone issued a statement that indicated contradictions between a cabinet statement issued at the time and a response she received from government. The cabinet statement indicated Mabuza had given a report to cabinet while later government said no such report existed. “On a regular basis we do give South Africans a sense of what are the verbal reports that are presented to cabinet. So there is nothing unusual, there is everything to do with keeping cabinet abreast with what they are doing and when there is a need for a memorandum, I think it will be submitted but in this particular case – the DP has been giving the verbal update of what is happening in Eskom,” says Williams.
