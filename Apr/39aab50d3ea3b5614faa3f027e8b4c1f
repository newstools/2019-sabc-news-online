CEO of Harith General Partners and Chairperson of Lebashe Investment Group, Tshepo Mahloele has continued with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) in Pretoria. He has told the Commission that everything they did was above board and without any favoritism. Mahloele has also explained that there was no conflict of interest as he had left the PIC long ago before he chaired the Harrith. The Commission queried him on why the position was not advertised or given to someone else rather than a former employee of the PIC. The company was established to manage the Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund formed by the PIC to raise funds for investment on the continent under the African renaissance initiative. Meanwhile, the United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader, Bantu Holomisa earlier this week told the Commission that the Harith/Labashe deal headed by former Deputy Finance Minister Jabu Moleketi, PIC Director Sibusisiwe Zulu, and Mahlolele benefited unfairly from PIC funding. He named them as the main cartel in the PIC deals. Holomisa has asked the Commission to further investigate other investment advisers and assets managers in the two deals. However, Mahloele disputed some of the evidence given by Holomisa as not factual. Watch video below:
