Emerging farmers in the impoverished Makholokoeng village in Harrismith in the Free State have received much-needed relief. More than R50 million worth of farming implements, fertilizer and seeds have been handed over to nine cooperatives in Makholokoeng at Harrismith by Rural Development minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. Nkoana-Mashabane says this will help boost food security. About 135 farmers stand to benefit. One farmer says, “We are so delighted because we thought that the government has forgotten about us, but now we can see that the government they still think about black people. ” “I think it will help us. Yes it will help us; it’s a good opportunity for young kids and youth. Yes, it’s a good opportunity for them to learn about farming,” added another farmer.
