Sudanese protesters blocked an attempt on Monday to break up a sit-in outside the Defence Ministry, where demonstrators have been pushing for a quick transition to civilian rule after President Omar al-Bashir was ousted last week. Earlier, the country’s main protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), called for people to continue with the sit in and foil any attempt to disperse them.   The sit-in outside the compound, which also includes the intelligence headquarters and the presidential residence, began last week, after more than three months of protests triggered by a deepening economic crisis. While some protesters chanted and waved flags, others recorded signs of the protest movement, drawing women and doves on nearby walls. “Marking the history and we reflect some message for the people because you know, now some people (are) not afraid, but they are tired and they want to stay. And, the people that didn’t come to this place, and we try to ask them to come again. We are not finished. We are not finished.” The protesters demanded that the country’s military rulers immediately hand power over to a civilian government. They also want ousted leader Omar al-Bashir brought to justice. At a meeting with political parties, the military council urged them to agree on an independent figure to be prime minister, said one protester, Abdelmeguid Afify.
