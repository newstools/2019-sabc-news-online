Eskom says cold and wet weather conditions could drive up the demand for electricity, increasing the risk of load shedding. In a statement released on Monday, the power utility warned that load shedding may be a possibility this week, according to its winter plan. Last week, Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan announced that Eskom aims to have no load shedding, or at most 26 days of Stage One load shedding until the end of August. Stage 4 load shedding was implemented last month but the grid has now been stabilised. Eskom has requested South Africans to use electricity sparingly this week.
