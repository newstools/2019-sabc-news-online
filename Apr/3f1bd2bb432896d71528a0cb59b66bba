Former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Johan Booysen claims the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) was captured in order to pursue their own interests and some holding political power. “It’s my view that, for reasons that I will elaborate on further in my evidence, that certain elements within the law enforcement and NPA has been captured for reasons of their own interest and in other cases to promote or to follow a particular agenda or narrative at the behest of people in political power – in some instances politicians that were directly involved.” Booysen has taken the stand at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown in Johannesburg on Wednesday. He is the second witness testifying over corruption and maladministration within the country’s law enforcement agencies. He follows former Independent Police Investigative Directorate head, Robert McBride’s four days of testimony. Booysen was arrested in 2012, accused of heading the so-called Cato Manor death squad – which was accused of carrying out the extra-judicial killings of 45 people. He was charged with racketeering, but recent reports revealed that the killings were based on falsified evidence. Click on video below:
