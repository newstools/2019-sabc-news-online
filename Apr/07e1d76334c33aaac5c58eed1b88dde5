Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says law enforcement officers will not be lenient on drunk drivers and those who fail to obey the rules of the road over the Easter long weekend. Nzimande launched the Easter road safety campaign aimed at increasing driver awareness and reducing road carnage on the country’s roads. The Minister launched the campaign on the N1 towards Limpopo. Thousands of vehicles are expected to pass along the route as many make their way to the annual Zion Christian Church’s Easter pilgrimage. The 2019 road safety campaigns will focus on motorists who drive under the influence of alcohol. Authorities say drinking and driving remains the leading causes of road crashes and fatalities. Speeding, reckless and negligent driving are also violations law enforcement will focus on. Also taxi drivers are cautioning fellow road users to adhere to rules of the road during the Easter holidays. As the Easter long weekend exodus gets underway, traffic is expected to be congested on all of South Africa’s major roads. Click video below:
