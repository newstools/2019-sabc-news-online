Tanzania says it is planning to ban single-use plastic bags soon. Environment Minister January Makamba told parliament it was possible that a ban could come into force in July. The announcement comes two days after Kenya called on Uganda and Tanzania to take action against the use of plastic bags – in an attempt to prevent them from being smuggled into its territory. In 2017, Kenya introduced one of the world’s strictest bans on plastic bags, penalising their use with four years in prison or fines of up to R560 000.
