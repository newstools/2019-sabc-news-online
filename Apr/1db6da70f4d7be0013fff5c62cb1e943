The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in the Peter Mokaba region in Limpopo has marched to the regional offices of the SABC in Polokwane. They are demanding that the freelance contracts of SABC workers be renewed. The contracts expired at the end of March. ANCYL Spokesperson in the Peter Mokaba region, Tonny Rachuene says, “Unfair practices affecting staff at the SABC; we write this memorandum in line with the recent changes, which has greatly contributed in the unemployment rates of the young people in the province. Recent changes are influenced by sheer personal preferences by certain individual within the broadcaster, but not guided by audio speakers and audio measurement,” says Rachuene. SABC Spokesperson, Vuyo Mthembu says they will study the memorandum and respond appropriately. “The SABC has received the memorandum and the SABC will study it and the it will respond to the memorandum in terms of minor changes or the changes that happened on radio. This is an annual process, which takes place in February and March and it’s informed by the revenue audience performance of the specific programs and shows,” says Mthembu.
