South Africa and Madagascar have met to celebrate 25 years of South Africa’s democracy. A South African delegation, led by the Director General of the Department of Arts and Culture, Vusumzi Mkhize, travelled to the capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo, to strengthen political and cultural ties between the two countries. On top of the agenda was the official handover of Radio Freedom equipment that was used by South African activists who were exiled in Madagascar during the dark days of apartheid. Radio Freedom was born in June 1963 and was a mobile radio medium to communicate with South Africans back home. It was the voice of exiled political leadership for almost three decades. And it operated in countries like Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia and Madagascar. South Africa’s Arts and Culture Department has now repatriated the Radio Freedom equipment from Madagascar to Pretoria where it will be preserved at Freedom Park next week.
