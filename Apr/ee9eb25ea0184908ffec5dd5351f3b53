There are normal traffic volumes on the N1, R71 and D4040 en route Mount Zion City in Moria outside Polokwane in Limpopo. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have converged on the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) and Saint Engenas ZCC for the Easter WeekendÂ church sermon. There were reports of traffic congestion at Carousel Toll Plaza and outside the two churches on Friday. The situation is however calm on Saturday morning, with thousands of pilgrims already on church grounds. Traffic authorities say no major or serious accidents were reported, except on Thursday where a head on collision at the N1 near Kranskop claimed the lives of 10 people. Traffic is expected to start increasing on Sunday as some holiday makers and pilgrims from various church organisations will be heading back to their homes.
