The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board has terminated the corporation’s Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chris Maroleng’s (also known as Maroleni) contract. The Board met on Tuesday and released a statement following the decision. Maroleng was found guilty of breaching of his fiduciary duties as well as negligence. “After due consideration of the findings and recommendations of a disciplinary process, the Board resolved to terminate the contract of employment of its Chief Operations Officer, Mr. Chris Maroleni, with immediate effect,” reads the brief statement in part. A Sunday newspaper article recently reported that Maroleng’s position at the SABC was under question, after he was found guilty on three charges. The disciplinary inquiry is understood to have started in 2018 and was conducted by an independent person. Watch video below:
