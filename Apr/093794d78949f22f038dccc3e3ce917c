President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised South Africans that government will work hard to improve rail transportation in the country.  He says government is currently working on plans to boost train services which will ensure that trains arrive on time, are not overcrowded and are safe. Ramaphosa was speaking at the launch of Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) new train model at Cape Town Train Station. “These trains are here to transport our people and as we move forward to improve our rail system. This is the best system for transporting people that we have in our country and should really be the safest form of transport. So I’d like us to work together, all of us, to improve safety, to improve the comfort.”  The modernised train which is blue, grey and black in colour can transport more than 200 passengers. The President also took a ride from the Cape Town Station to Mowbray and back, accompanied by Transport Minister Blade Nzimande, and board members and senior executives from PRASA. Last month, the President experienced first hand the challenges train commuters experience on a daily basis when a train he boarded during an engagement with commuters broke down. “We are going to make sure that our trains run on time. I have discussed that with the Minister and the board …” the President indicated.
