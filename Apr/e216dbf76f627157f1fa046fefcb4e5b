A major clean-up operation is currently under way at various beaches along Durban’s coastline. This after a blanket of plastic and refuse covered the water’s surface following torrential rains that battered the eThekwini Municipality this week. Volunteer and one of the operation’s coordinators – Douw Steyn – says the amount of dirt that they have picked up so far is shocking. He says more awareness campaigns are needed to educate the public about recycling and proper dumping procedures. “Lots of volunteers throughout the Durban beaches are cleaning up a lot of plastics and materials and in the harbour and Natal Yacht Club. Unfortunately, the challenge we have is that if we don’t have proper waste management upstream in our rivers. People are dumping etc. It causes us a big problem when it rains. We need to work together and come up with applicable waste management and recycling solutions.”
