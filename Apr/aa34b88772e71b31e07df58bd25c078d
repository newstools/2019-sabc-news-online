Two learners have been arrested for murder following the death of a 12-year-old learner from Grace and Hope Special School in Seshego outside Polokwane in Limpopo. Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says the suspects are aged 14 and 16, respectively. He says the learner’s body was discovered on Saturday morning at the school hostel. “I can confirm that we have arrested two suspects aged 14 and 16 on a charge of murder, following this incident at the school. The two suspects will be appearing before the Seshego Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. Our investigations are continuing. Both of them are confirmed to be learners at the school. It’s early now for us, to go into details of this, because every incident that happens in a learning environment is sensitive,” says Ngoepe. Meanwhile, it was reported last week that police were disappointed that the Polokwane Children’s Court had granted bail to seven teenagers who allegedly killed 28-year-old Thorisho Themane in February. The teen suspects aged between 13 and 17, who are learners at various schools in Polokwane, were each given bail of R2000 on Wednesday. One of the bail conditions is that they must be transferred from their schools and continue their studies outside Polokwane. General Nneke Ledwaba says police were ready to oppose bail, but the magistrate ordered them to leave the courtroom.
