The academic programme at the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth have been disrupted by protest action. Small groups of students are demanding accommodation and shuttle services. They have blocked off entrances to North and South campus of the tertiary institution. NMU students insist on making their grievances known. They first went door-to-door around the campus to disrupt classes. The disruptions are expected to last until there is permanent solution. The university is yet to build 1800 new accommodation rooms it promised. SRC President Bamanye Matiwane says that they will not stop protesting until students have accommodation. “In the meantime, we are not going to stop striking until those students have accommodation. As I am speaking now, I have more than 16 students in my room because they do not have any place to go. Some are sleeping in comrades’ rooms because we do not have any place to accommodate them. We are saying we are not Jesus, we are not Messiahs; all that we want is that the university must assist us. We have no way else, but to fight as students; which is why we see these number of students.” NMU says it’s keen to address the issues, but that can only be done in a formal meeting. In the meantime, police have been called in for intervention. Classes are expected to continue. WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
