The Tshwane Metro Police have warned members of the public not to participate in an illegal #ShutDown protest march planned for on Thursday. Members of the South African Civic Organization (Sanco) in Pretoria have threatened to blockade all exits and access roads to the city from 4 o’clock in the morning ahead of the State of the City Address by the city’s Executive Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa. They are protesting against lack of service delivery and also calling for the disbandment of the Democratic Alliance /Economic Freedom Fighters coalition council of the City of Tshwane. Metro Police Spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says the protest is unlawful. “We are aware of the many threats by Sanco and residents of Pretoria West to boycott or to march. What we would like to say is that we and other law enforcement agencies are ready for any eventuality that might happen and anybody who will want to march, we will deal with any situation.” Meanwhile, Sanco Chairperson in Tshwane, Abram Mashishi says they do not need to apply to stage a protest march to highlight the plight of the community. “Remember, in terms of the new Constitutional Court, you no longer apply to march. It’s a democratic right. So, the community has given us the mandate.”
