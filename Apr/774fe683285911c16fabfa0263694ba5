The High Court in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape has dismissed African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela Bay councillor, Andile Lungisa‘s bid to appeal his conviction and an effective two-year jail sentence. Last year the High Court in Port Elizabeth found Lungisa guilty of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. In October 2016, he smashed a glass jug over the head of a former member of the mayoral committee Rano Kayser, during a chaotic council meeting. In his trial, Lungisa pleaded not guilty and testified that he felt threatened at the time. NPA spokesperson Tshepo Ndwalaza says they welcome the judgment. “As the NPA we’ve been vindicated because we have always believed that the judgment that was taken was a valid judgment there was no problem about it at all. Justice has been served.”  Click on videos below:
