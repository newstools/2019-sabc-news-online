The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng says it has evidence that the leaders of the Alex Total Shutdown movement are affiliated to the African National Congress (ANC). The DA has again accused the ANC of inciting violence in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The DA visited the township on Tuesday to inform residents of Mayor Herman Mashaba‘s visit to the area on Monday next week. Aggrieved residents have been calling for a meeting with the mayor since protests began last week. Gauteng Premier candidate, Solly Msimanga, has laid charges against the ANC for the alleged incitement of violence in the township. “They are ANC aligned. The people of Alexandra township have brought this information to us. In fact, there is also photographic evidence of the fact that this councillor, in particular, was removing EFF posters as early as January from the poles. So, we have evidence which we definitely will be presenting to the authorities to investigate further,” says DA Gauteng leader John Moodey. Gauteng Premier David Makhura visited Alexandra on Tuesday and met with community leaders who’ve been at the forefront of protests in the township. Watch a related video below:
