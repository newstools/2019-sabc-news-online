South African Communist Party (SACP) national deputy chairperson, Thulas Nxesi, says the African National Congress (ANC) has to deal with its internal divisions decisively each time they arise. He was responding to a question about some disgruntled ANC members in the Free State and Mpumalanga provinces who took the party to court. They were urging the courts to dissolve their Provincial Executive Committees. Nxesi was speaking at a memorial lecture organised by trade union Nehawu in honour of struggle icon Moses Kotane at Phela near Rustenburg in the North West. “There is no better timing. Problems will always be there in the organisation, but we need to have processes that whenever there are problems, we are able to sit and deal with those particular problems and know that sometimes courts are not very helpful. They become very technical in dealing with the issues. But, even before that, before people can consider going to court, we must acknowledge where there are problems, and find ways of dealing with those problems.” WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
