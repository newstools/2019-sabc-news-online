Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe is leaving the power utility at the end of April. Phasiwe has been at Eskom for 10 years, five of which as the power utility’s national spokesperson. The cash-strapped electricity distributor has faced serious leadership crisis, mismanagement and lack of maintenance of power generators which has seen the country suffering rolling power outages. Phasiwe says working for Eskom has not been an easy task. He says, “The difficulty was that our problems never end. Almost everyday, every week there’s a new thing coming so it was very difficult.” “But through the grace of God I have been able to do what I had to do. Working here is tantamount to being in a war zone. There’s been very difficult situations, new things coming out, but we have been able to do our job diligently with the necessary professionalism.” Related Video Below
