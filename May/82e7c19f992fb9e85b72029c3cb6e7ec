The KwaZulu-Natal Government Communication Information System (GCIS) Department says there will be public viewing areas in various parts of the province for the President’s inauguration on Saturday. President-elect Cyril Ramaphosa’s inauguration ceremony will take place at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria. This is to allow tens of thousands of ordinary South Africans to attend the event. However, people across the country will also be able to be part of the action at the special viewing areas.  KwaZulu-Natal GCIS Director Ndala Mngadi says they want to make sure that the inauguration is accessible to as many people as possible. “We’ve got seven areas where we will be screening and making sure that as many people as possible are able to watch the inauguration and are able to be part of the proceedings and to take part in discussion and programs that will be taking place in different parts of the province.” Mngadi says this is an opportunity for young people to start getting involved and talk about what they would like to hear in the coming State of the Nation Address. #SABC platforms bring you rolling coverage of today’s #SAInauguration19 Tune into #SABC2, channel 404, the #sabcnews app; and other platforms @Newsbreak_Lotus @SAfmRadio @Phalaphala @motswedingfm @Ikwekwezi_FM for live minute-by-minute broadcasts of the #Presidentialinauguration pic.twitter.com/zi8zfnO9XX — Ronesh Dhawraj (@ronesh) May 25, 2019  2019 PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION – Together Celebrating Democracy: Renewal and Growth for a better South Africa #PeoplesInauguration  pic.twitter.com/9xvKfUOE6Q — PresidencyZA (@PresidencyZA) May 25, 2019  Click on related videos below:
