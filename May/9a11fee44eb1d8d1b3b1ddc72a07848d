Johannesburg residents can expect to pay more for water and electricity when the new tariff hikes come into effect on July 1. Property rates and refuse removal fees are also set to rise. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Finance in the City of Joburg, Funzela Ngobeni, tabled the City’s R64.5 billion budget for the 2019 and 2020 financial year in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. Ngobeni says the decision by the National Energy Regulator (NERSA) to grant Eskom a price increase, also forces the city to hike its tariffs. “The city has little option but to increase the electricity tariff from its original proposed 12.20% average tariff to a proposed 13.07% across all categories of customers.” “On Johannesburg Water, the proposed tariff remains at 9.9% and is confirmed for the 2019/20 financial year. The tariff for property rates and refuse removal remain at 5.5% and 7% respectively.” Related video below:
