A political analyst from the University of the Free State says the deployment of controversial officials in top positions is a sign that cadre deployment continues unabated within the governing African National Congress (ANC). Dr Sethulego Matebesi was responding to Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela‘s announcement of a number of controversial officials in her cabinet. The current executive committee includes, former mayor of the collapsed Moqhaka municipality    Tshidi Koloi, as well as MEC for Small Business, Makalo Mohale, a former CFO of the Ngwathe Municipality, alleged to have been involved in fraudulent activities. Matebesi says it has become a norm in the ANC to reward questionable people. “We should understand that the ruling party is under a tremendous pressure currently. Unfortunately cadre deployment policy of the ANC is taking precedent over good governance because people who have messed up at local government and other key positions are now been sent to the province as MECs. That is unacceptable. So the message that is sent is that people who done wrong in the past are rewarded,” says political analyst, Dr Sethulego Matebesi. Meanwhile, Ntombela maintains that she has a competent executive council. “It is not only the mayor who is going to make that municipality to succeed it must be a team. Mayors, Councillors, Communities, Managers when things are not right it is not the mayor it’s the responsibility of the whole team.  You must remember Free state is a rural area people are depending on  grants. Most of them are not paying for services if they are not paying the municipality is not going to be successful. We must make sure we are getting competent people that’s what we are going to do, says Ntombela.  Watch related video below:
