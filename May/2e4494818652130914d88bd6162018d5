SAPS National Commissioner Khehla Sitole has welcomed the conviction and sentencing of four suspects in connection with the robbery of passengers travelling through O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. The four accused, Simphiwe Zwane, Thulani Sibanda, Qhubani Tshuma and Stanley Moyo had been following travellers from the airport to various destinations and robbing them. Their reign of terror came to an end on 14th July 2017, following a shootout with the police on the R21 highway near the airport. They were eventually arrested. Spokesperson for the National Commissioner Vish Naidoo says all four accused were convicted last week and collectively sentenced to over 100 years imprisonment. “They were convicted and sentenced to 106 years imprisonment in total. Two of them got 30 years, one got 31 years and the fourth one got 15 years in prison for cases of armed robbery, unlawful possession of arms and ammunition and possession of property suspected to be stolen. The national commissioner has praised the team for the good work that they have done. It’s almost two years since the arrest, but we had to ensure that the investigation went well as the prosecution was done thoroughly so as to secure the conviction and sentencing of these four accused.”
