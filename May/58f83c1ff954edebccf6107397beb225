The murder and attempted murder trial of eight Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) leaders will be heard in the Pretoria High Court in on Monday. The men face charges of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder and the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. They accused are alleged to have shot and wounded the unionâ€™s newly elected chairperson, Malibongwe Mdazo, at a Marikana branch in 2017. Mdazo was accosted while leaving a soccer stadium in Mooinooi, near Rustenburg and was shot multiple times. Later in the day, Mveliso Biyela, who had been walking home with his wife and son in Wonderkop near Marikana, was also shot multiple times and died on the scene. The State alleges that the same weapon used to kill Biyela was used to shoot Mdazo. The accused were allegedly frustrated because concerns that they wanted to raise with the union were not being entertained to their satisfaction.
