Department of Water and Sanitation workers affiliated to South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) are currently being addressed by the eThekwini City manager at the Durban city hall. Various roads in and around the city have been closed to traffic due to the protesting workers. It is alleged that the eThekwini municipality has halted the pay grade adjustment process for Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans working in the city’s water department that led to strike action. Trash is scattered across the streets. However police are monitoring the situation. Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersadh says: “In the Durban CBD there are no roads that have been blocked except for West Street, Field Street, Smith Street and Aliwall Street, those are the intersections that have been blocked in the outer cordoned off the City Hall. There are about approximately 2000 municipal workers that are being addressed by the city manager. However, around the City Hall and all the roads leading into the city and out for the city are not blocked. All the blockages have been removed and traffic is now flowing freely.” Watch related video:
