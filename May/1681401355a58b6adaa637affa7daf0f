The ANC Youth League is calling on the ANC leadership to disband the league . They are scheduled to protest outside St. Georges Hotel in Pretoria, the venue of the ANC NEC meeting and Lekogtla. The Youth League is calling on the mother body to dissolve the ANC Youth League so that a new national elective conference can take place. Secretary of the ANCYL at the Algoid Branch in Seshego, Thabo Mabotja says as the party members they are tired of being led by the older generation of the youth league. He says as young people of the country, they’ll be protesting with the aim to seek attention from top ANC leaders. “We as young lions of Peter Mokaba, coming from all corners of South Africa, we will be protesting peacefully for now, calling for the immediate disbandment of the ANC Youth League, before or during the youth month. We don’t believe that they carry the necessary mandate to represent our mission and aspirations as young people from all over the country. Therefore we’ll be calling upon the NEC to disband the ANC Youth League.”
