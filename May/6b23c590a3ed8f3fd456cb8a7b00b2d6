Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has accused the National Energy Regulator of rewarding corruption at Eskom, by allowing a 15% increase in electricity tariffs. Mashaba released a statement after metros and councils across the country received correspondence from NERSA on how price increases are to be implemented. But, NERSA has justified their move saying municipalities were consulted on the matter. NERSA spokesperson Charles Hlebela says they have noted Mashaba’s comments. “We have noted the statement from Herman Mashaba and it is just unfortunate for him to have reacted the way he has, but it is a process that we have undertaken and we’ve had consultations with municipalities reading this. Our role is to determine the prices and terms for municipalities and Eskom and when we receive applications which are coming from municipalities we have to consider those and make a determination.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/687956">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
