The head of the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) Investigating Directorate, Advocate Hermione Cronje, has outlined her team’s priorities – saying corruption within state-owned enterprises should be dealt with. She was speaking in Pretoria after being officially introduced as the unit’s boss. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Cronje earlier this month to head the directorate that will investigate any unlawful activities relating to serious, high-profile or complex corruption. Cronje says her team will work to gain back the public’s confidence in the NPA. “We need to get our own house in order first. The public needs to have confidence that those who need to address this problem are able and capable and have the integrity to do so. The next big focus area will be our SOEs – Eskom, Transnet, PRASA and a few others. A third area would be high level public and private sector corruption. The idea is to focus on those who systematically and actively sought to corrupt government procurement systems and processes for private gain.”
