The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) says it will continue with its audit of the CemAir airline. The disgruntled airline approached the Civil Aviation Appeal Committee (CAAC) with the hope to have its grounding overturned. Earlier this year, the airline launched a legal bid against SACAA after the regulatory body found that it could not operate as it did not comply with over ten regulations. “In the interest of Aviation development and safety, it is our wish to see the airline going back to flying but the airline must demonstrate compliance because when it comes to aviation safety, when it comes to passenger’s lives we cannot gamble there. We cannot allow a situation where we know that there are safety deficiencies, we will not be able to give approval or we will not allow that operator to continue flying when we know that there are serious safety concerns,” says Poppy Khoza, SACAA CEO.
