The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) says it has received close to 460 000 online applications for grades one and eight for the 2020 academic year. Applications will close at midnight on July 22 and thereafter placement of learners will commence. Parents are urged to submit necessary documents to schools within seven working days, after applying. Parents that have Grade R learners are advised to also apply online for Grade 1. Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “It is paramount to note that the recorded applications are from 226 000 applications. These figures simply indicate that we probably have about 100 000 spaces remaining at our schools for both Grade 1 and Grade 8 learners respectively.”   WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
