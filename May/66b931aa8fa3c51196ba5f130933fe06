The four suspects who were arrested for the murder of two Metro police officers outside a councillor’s house in Chatsworth, Durban appear on Monday at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. Three of the suspects were arrested on Thursday whilst the fourth was arrested on Saturday morning at KwaMashu township north of Durban, after an shootout with the police. The Hawks also revealed that the fourth accused sustained gunshot injuries. KwaZulu Natal Hawks spokesperson Siyabonga Mhlongo said, “The one suspect is still in hospital, he will appear in absentia, the other three will appear this morning…” “They are facing murder charges as well as robbery as we can remember that they also robbed firearms off a police man which was later recovered at the suspects’ house in KwaMashu…” added Mhlongo.
