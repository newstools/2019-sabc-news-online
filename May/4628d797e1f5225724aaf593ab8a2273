The three men accused of killing former ANC Youth League Secretary General, Sindiso Magaqa, have been denied bail in the uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court, in southern KwaZulu-Natal. The trio, Sibonelo Myeza, Mbulelo Mpofana and Mlungisi Ncalane, also face two counts of attempted murder. The charges relate to the injuring of two councillors, who were sitting in a car with Magaqa when it was sprayed with AK-47 bullets outside a store in Umzimkhulu in July 2017. The accused are denying guilt. KwaZulu-Natal National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson, Natasha Ramkisson-Kara says, “The matter has been postponed for the 31st of May where their case will be joined to the original accused and the accused will remain in custody.” Watch Magaqa’s funeral service:  The attack on Magaqa and his two ANC colleagues occurred after a council meeting and was believed to have been linked to infighting in the governing party’s Harry Gwala region. The former ANCYL leader was taken to hospital, but succumbed to his injuries after almost two months in hospital.
