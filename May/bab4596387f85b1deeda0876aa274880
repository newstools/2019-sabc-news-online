The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Patricia de Lille is being rewarded for her loyalty to the governing African National Congress (ANC). GOOD Party leader de Lille and the rest of President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s executive have taken their oaths of office at a ceremony at the Presidential Guest House in Pretoria. De Lille has been dubbed on social media as the ‘comeback of the year.’ She is Ramaphosa’s Public Works Minister. De Lille had fallen out with the Democratic Alliance (DA) before the general elections and formed the Good Party. De Lille is currently the only opposition party member in the executive. She had strongly denied allegations in 2018 of corruption during her tenure as mayor – and vowed to clear her name. Chief Whip of the DA, John Steenhuisen has reacted to Ramaphosa’s appointment of De Lille. “No, it’s not a slap in the face. I think it completely concerns what we have said to those in the Western Cape that voting for GOOD was going to be a vote for the ANC and the disappointment has simply proven that it was an ANC project in the Western Cape to destabilise the DA and that didn’t work and De Lille is being rewarded by the president for the work done in that particular election.” Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has presided over the new ministers taking of their oath of office.
