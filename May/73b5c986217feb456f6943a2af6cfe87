Four Chinese nationals have been found guilty of the illegal possession of endangered plant species with an estimated value of R1.5-million. The four were arrested earlier this month on the N7 near Springbok in the Northern Cape and sentenced to two years with an option to pay a fine and donate funds to a provincial nature conservation organisation. Police spokesperson, Olebogeng Tawana confirmed the arrests and sentencing. “They were found in possession of succulent plants which they were not supposed to be in possession of without any relevant documentation. They were found guilty earlier this week, they were also sentenced to two years imprisonment with an option of paying a fine of R150 000 each. They did that and managed to pay that particular fine and also they were fined R100 000 which they had to donate to the relevant nature conservation organisations in the province ”, said Tawana.
