The Human Rights Commission has agreed to try and negotiate a settlement agreement with former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer (COO) Angelo Agrizzi over his racist utterances. In an audio clip played at the State Capture inquiry where Agrizzi was testifying, he used the k-word several times. The Equality Court, sitting in Randburg, asked the parties to negotiate. “The matter was postponed today. We met with my colleague from the South African Human Rights Commission potentially to discuss settlements. However, it will only be discussed in the coming weeks once both parties have an opportunity to consider everything. So it’s been postponed to the 27th of next month. The criminal matter was heard yesterday and the charges were withdrawn,” says Daniel Witz, Agrizzi’s lawyer.
