A lawyer and director at MNS attorney Thobani Mnyandu is expected to make his second appearance before the State Capture Inquiry this morning at 9:30 in Parktown, Johannesburg. Mnyandu says that the R1.2-billion paid to China North Rail and Bombadier Transport collectively for the relocation costs from Johannesburg to Durban was not sufficiently interrogated before payments were made.Â  Mnyandu says their investigation found that there was no relocation of either China North Rail or Bombadier despite receiving payments from Transnet of R648 million and R618 million, respectively. He says that it was strange that Transnet official sort to address suppliers on the economic downturn in South Africa and yet agreed to the aggregate amount of R1.2-billion were the costs were unjustifiable and had not been substantiated. Mnyandu says the now suspended Transnet Procurement official Lindiwe Mdletshe was hostile in her engagements with MNS attorneys during the course of their investigation at Transnet. He said that Mdletshe played a key role in the communication process between the Transnet negotiation team, China North Rail and Bombadier transportation. :
