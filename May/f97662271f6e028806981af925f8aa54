The sexual assault and crimen injuria case against former African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape leader, Marius Fransman has been postponed to 10 July in the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court. Fransman appeared briefly in court on Thursday morning.  He is facing charges related to allegations that he sexually assaulted his former PA, Louisa Wynand in 2016 while they were driving to the North West province for the ANC’s 80th birthday celebrations. Fransman was suspended from the ANC for five years. He denies the allegations. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson, Phaladi Shuping says Fransman will have ample opportunity to present his defence “The prosecutors were convinced that there are reasonable prospects of a successful conviction hence they put the matter on the court roll. He’ll be afforded an opportunity to present evidence that will exonerate him and the matter will be presided over by the magistrate. He’ll be afforded an opportunity of stating his case,” says Shuping.
