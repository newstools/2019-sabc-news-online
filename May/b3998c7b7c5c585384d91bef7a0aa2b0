The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) has weighed in on the political and economic crisis in Venezuela saying the citizens need to make a decisive choice on who should lead them. This after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro declared defeat over an uprising of a group of soldiers backing opposition leader, Juan Guaido. On Tuesday, Guaido made his strongest call yet to the military to help him oust Maduro. A power struggle between Maduro and Guaidó has been brewing since January after Guaidó declared himself as interim leader. SAFTU General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi says: It is the right of the people of Venezuela to decide which political and economic system they want to have based on their own beliefs.” He says it is their country and it is their right to have secure borders without the existence of a military threat. “It is their right to choose leaders that they believe can best represent their own interests as a nation,” adds Vavi.
