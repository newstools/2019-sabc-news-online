The JB Marks Municipal Council in Potchefstroom, North West, has rejected the provincial government’s decision to place it under administration. The provincial government placed the municipality and six others under administration. During its council sitting, the municipality argued that due processes were not followed in implementing the decision. “The province didn’t go through the right procedure. One, they should start with 139 1 not B, because if there is something where we are lacking, they must come down and assist us, here we are lacking, try to resolve here, we’ll support you there and there, according to the constitution,” says ANC Councillor, Komane Maneli. But North West Local Government MEC Motlalepula Rosho maintains that the decision will be enforced. Rosho says,  “If there’s resistance, I think what we’ll do is to engage with councillors, to communicate this to councillors, and make the councillors to realise the importance of intervention of Section 139.” This brings the total number of municipalities under administration in the province to 15. The provincial government is citing financial distress, collapse of service delivery and instability in council as the reasons for the intervention. The affected municipalities include, JB Marks in Potchefstroom and Ventersdorp, Mamusa in Schweizer-Reneke, Lekwa Teemane in Bloemhof and Christiana, Ratlou in Setlagole, Tswaing in Delareyville, Madibeng in Brits and Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District based in Vryburg.
