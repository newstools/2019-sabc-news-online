Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the size of president-elect Cyril Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet needs to be reduced and some key appoints must be made. Maimane was speaking at Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria, where thousands of people have gathered for the Presidential inauguration. Ramaphosa is due to be sworn-in as the head of the sixth administration. Maimane says, “Let’s reduce the size of the cabinet. We can run a government of between 15 to 20 ministers. We must get rid of deputy ministers. We need some key appointments. We need a Health Minister who is not going to be just in the doctrine of NHI but rather to look at how we can look at the private sector.” He adds: “Let’s look to make the economic cluster much smaller. I would urge that Tito Mboweni must remain in his post so he can continue the work of reform. We need a strong Minister of Education who will not listen to unions. We need to make sure we set up a ministry for jobs. I think that must be a crucial ministry, so we can create work.”
