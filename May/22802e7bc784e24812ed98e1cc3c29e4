The Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, has received R46 million from an international NGO, Bristol-Myers Squibb foundation, to assist with cancer treatment. Newly appointed health MEC, Sindiswa Gomba says this cash injection will assist her department in its initiative for early detection and prevention of cancer. She says people from the former Transkei area no longer need to travel long distances to get treatment at Frere Hospital in East London. “We have got people who are coming from the far flung areas, who take up to four days to get to their service; that service is only in East London and if they go to East London they run a risk of not of being served. “Remember East London has got one lab, also having its own patients. Now this initiative which is being launched today is about decentralising the services of cancer treatment.”
