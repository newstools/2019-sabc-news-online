Deputy chief Justice Raymond Zondo has expressed concern over the capture of law enforcement agencies in the country. He says if law enforcement agencies are not upholding the rule of law then there is no country. Judge Zondo echoed these sentiments as former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss, Johan Booysen was giving evidence at the State Capture inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg. Booysen testified on how law enforcement agencies were captured to protect high ranking politicians and businessmen in KwaZulu-Natal. Booysen also testified that when  former national Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza took over office, he sidelined investigators and appointed people he could control. Watch State Capture Inquiry Below:
