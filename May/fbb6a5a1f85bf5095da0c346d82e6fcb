The African People’s Convention says their poor performance in the general elections is a temporary setback. The small party won less than 20 000 votes nationally losing their only seat in Parliament. Party leader, Themba Godi says the leadership is now meeting to reflect on its failures. He says they are determined to create a turnaround strategy that will help them improve support for the local government elections in 2021. “We are very disappointed. We worked very hard. We had structures. We did everything we believed needed to be done. What I can say with certainty is that we were robbed. We are not deterred. We have identified some things that we need to deal with so that our hard labour is not stolen from us like this time around.”
