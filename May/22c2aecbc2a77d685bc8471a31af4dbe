African National Congress (ANC) MP Thandi Modise has been elected as Speaker of the National Assembly.  Thandi Modise overcame the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Richard Majola by 250 votes, whilst Majola only got 83 votes. Modise’s name was proposed by Minister Nosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Majola by DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen. Voting took place earlier in the day via secret ballot in Parliament for the position of Speaker of the National Assembly. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) had supported the African National Congress (ANC) nomination of Thandi Modise for the position of Speaker of the National Assembly. Lechesa Tsenoli has been elected unopposed as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng announced the results of a secret ballot, declaring Modise’s victory.  EFF leader Julius Malema voiced his support for Modise. However, EFF MPs refrained from voting as they did in 2014. The EFF has abstained from voting for the position of National Assembly Speaker. Members of the party have remained seated when their names were called while other members went to the voting booths. “When you compare Thandi Modise with the previous speaker Baleka Mbete, she’s the most reasonable person, she’s seasoned she’s a woman of substance and she’s able to rise above political party pettiness and we hope that when elected she will not succumb to the party pressure to a point where she wants to turn this parliament into a mouthpiece of the ANC,” said Malema. Earlier the African National Congress (ANC) MPs have broken out into song in Parliament as they wait for the votes to be counted for the position of National Assembly Speaker.
