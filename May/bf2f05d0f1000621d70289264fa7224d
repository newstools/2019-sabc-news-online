Former Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom says he will remain a Member of Parliament despite not being appointed to the executive. Hanekom was not included in the new Cabinet appointed by Ramaphosa on Wednesday night. In March 2017, Hanekom was sacked during a late night Cabinet reshuffle by former President Jacob Zuma and also opted to remain a MP. Hanekom had led a move of no confidence in Zuma and for him to be recalled in November 2016 during a meeting of the African National Congressâ€™s (ANC) National Executive Committee. He was reappointed Tourism Minister in February 2018 when Ramaphosa took over from a recalled Zuma. In a text message, Hanekom says he would not be doing any interviews about his future plans. He says he is opting to remain a Member of Parliament and hopes to devote more of his time to the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation where he is the chairperson.
