Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has expressed shock over the timing of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s report into the Ivan Pillay pension matter. Gordhan’s lawyer Tebogo Malatji says Gordhan totally rejects Mkwhebane’s findings. She found that Gordhan was guilty of improper conduct in the decision he made as Finance Minister to grant SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay early retirement. The lawyers say charges in this matter were withdrawn by the NPA in 2016 – most likely because they were not legally sustainable. Malatji says they’ll immediately take the report on review.
