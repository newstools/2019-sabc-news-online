The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) says they have received numerous complaints of a strong diesel smell on certain floors from SABC employees at the Radio Park Building in Auckland Park, Johannesburg. This follows the diesel leak at the building last Wednesday. On Monday, all staff returned to work after the building was declared safe by the Johannesburg Fire Chief, who officially handed the building back to the public broadcaster’s management. Bemawu president Hannes du Buisson says he has engaged with the SABC, asking them for all non-essential staff to be sent home until the diesel smell is gone. Du Buisson says, “We received a number of complaints yesterday (Monday) from employees of the SABC where they said that the diesel fumes and smell was still quite strong in particular at several floors of the Radio Park Building of the SABC.” “We then engaged the CEO in a letter were we asked the CEO that non-essential staff be sent home and then for essential staff that they be accommodated elsewhere just until the diesel smell disappears from the building,” he adds.
