The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal says it’s not aware of the arrest of eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede, on corruption charges. This follows media reports that Gumede has handed herself over to the Hawks and will appear in the Durban Commercial Crimes court this morning. Last year it emerged that Gumede, was being investigated by the Hawks for money laundering‚ fraud and corruption, allegedly to pay back those who helped her political ambitions. KZN ANC spokesperson Dumisani Ntuli says the law must take its course. The mayor has never informed me or the ANC in the province that she will be appearing court, but the ANC is an organisation that respects laws of the country irrespective of who becomes suspected perpetrator, so if that happens it will happen and the ANC position will always be that we must always allow the law to take its course. Meanwhile, Hawks national spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi has declined to confirm or deny reports that Gumede has handed herself over to the police. Mulaudzi told the SABC this morning that three people will appear in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court today. He did not divulge the names or any further information. Mulaudzi says the names of the accused will only be known once they appear in court. In recent weeks two Ethekwini officials were arrested for similar offences in the Ethekwini municipality.
