Security has been beefed up at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court ahead of eThekwini Municipality Mayor Zandile Gumede’s appearance in court with two other officials. She allegedly handed herself over to the Hawks. Gumede is allegedly facing charges related to fraud and corruption to the amount of over R208 million. Last year, it emerged that Gumede was being investigated by the Hawks for money laundering‚ fraud and corruption, allegedly to pay back those who helped her political ambitions. Meanwhile, KZN ANC spokesperson Dumisani Ntuli says the law must take its course. “The Mayor has never informed me or the ANC in the province that she will be appearing in court, but the ANC is an organisation that respects the laws of the country irrespective of who becomes the suspected perpetrator, so if that happens it will happen and the ANC position will always be that we must always allow the law to take its course.” Click related video:
