Cape Town Metro Police say they have arrested three suspects after they were caught in possession of tools used for breaking into houses, in Bothasig. Metro police spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, says officers noticed them driving around in a car in the area. He says the officers followed the car and instructed the driver to pull over. Upon questioning the suspects they all gave contradictory reasons for having the tools in their possession and were placed under arrest. “The officers spotted a suspicious vehicle and called for assistance in order to pull the vehicle over. Once the vehicle had been pulled over and searched it was found to have a crow bar (house break-in tools), screwdrivers (car break-in tools) and even a glass cutter and gloves. The suspects aged 33 and 35 from Mannenberg were transported to Bothasig SAPS and charged,” says Dyason.
