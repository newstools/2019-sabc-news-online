The office of Bapedi Acting King Kgagudi Kenneth Sekhukhune is going to challenge a decision by the Supreme Court of Appeal to dismiss his application for leave to appeal a ruling declaring Thulare Victor Thulare Sekhukhune the Third as Bapedi ruler. The Nhlapo Commission on Traditional Leadership in 2019 ruled that Thulare Victor Thulare the Third as the King of Bapedi, and K.K Sekhukhune took that decision to court. Spokesperson of K.K Sekhukhune’s office Samson Phakwago says they will accept any decision of the Constitutional Court. “Kgoshikgulu K.K Sekhukhune and his council has taken a conscious decision to take this further to the Constitutional court particularly that this case involves the customary law of Bapedi now it is the constitutional Court which is more competent to handle such cases, hence we have already started with the process. We have a deadline of the 27th of this month to make submission of court papers, but we have also issued the letters of notice that we are going to the Constitutional Court.” Phakwago further says that Thulare Victor Thulare the Third is not supposed to be the King of Bapedi as recommended by the Nhlapho Commission as he is the third born son, and not the first born son of the candle wife. “It is the royal family that has got the right to decide on who should be the king of a traditional leader, and according to our tradition the first born son of the candle wife is the one who assumes that responsibility, who ascends the throne whether is a kingship of the senior traditional leader that is exactly what the law says. Unfortunately the Nhlapho commission made the recommendation that a third born son of his parents should be the king which is very, very different from what we know,” added Phakwago. WATCH
