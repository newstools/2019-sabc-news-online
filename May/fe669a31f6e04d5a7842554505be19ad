The Presidency says preparations are in full swing for the inauguration ceremony of South Africa’s next democratically elected President. Given the current economic situation, government says it’s spending less on the inauguration compared to the previous one. A number of African Heads of State are expected to attend the inauguration of Cyril Ramaphosa on the 25th of May. The inauguration will coincide with Africa Day. Minister in the Presidency, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma, says 32 000 people are expected to fill up the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria for the Inauguration. For the first time, the President will be inaugurated at Loftus Versveld Stadium instead of how it was traditionally done at the Union Buildings before. The Inter-Ministerial committee on the Presidential Inauguration led by Dlamini-Zuma says although they can’t say how much the event will cost, it will be R100 million less compared to the previous one, and will be more inclusive. “The choice of the venue was determined by a number of factors, I’ll just mention few: The costs – because preparing the amphitheatre  is more costly than hiring a stadium. But the other important reason is that there is going to be an inclusive programme where everyone will be seeing everything at the same place at the same time instead of others being at the amphitheatre  and others on the lawns,” explains Dlamini-Zuma.
