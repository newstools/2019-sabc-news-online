African National Congress (ANC) Deputy President David Mabuza will be sworn-in as an ANC MP at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guest House in Pretoria on Tuesday. This is according to the ANC Caucus in Parliament. It has also been confirmed by the office of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The swearing-in ceremony will be conducted by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. This comes after Mabuza postponed his swearing-in last week pending the outcome of the ANC’s integrity committee investigation into him.   Mabuza’s swearing-in comes almost a week after the first sitting of the National Assembly last Wednesday where close to 400 MP were sworn-in. The spokesperson of the Office of the Chief Justice, Nathi Mncube, has also confirmed to SABC News in Parliament that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will conduct the swearing in ceremony. Mabuza’s swearing-in comes at a time when President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to appoint and announce his National Executive later this week. South Africans will know later this week whether the President will appoint Mabuza to become his deputy. In terms of the Constitution, the President must select his Deputy President from among members of the National Assembly.
