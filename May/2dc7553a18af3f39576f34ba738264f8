Former colleagues and Eastern Cape Members of Provincial Legislature have described the former Public Works MEC, Thobile Mhlahlo as an astute leader. The newly-sworn-in MPLs visited Mhlahlo’s home in Port Elizabeth to pay their respects. Sixty-four-year-old Mhlahlo passed away two weeks ago after a short illness. He will be laid to rest on Saturday in a Special Official Provincial funeral. Eastern Cape Legislature Speaker, Helen Sauls-August, says he contributed in the Legislature. “He contributed in the Legislature having served in Public Works, serving in Transport and Safety. He’s astuteness with handling specifically when it came to safety issues. I remember fondly his contribution going to the Richmond Hill area when they started with drug infestation in the area taking the police there knocking at the doors, kicking down doors. So, that was a kind of a figure he was; a fighter. And nothing could stop him in that respect,” says Sauls-August. Former MP, Humphrey Maxhegwana who served with Mhlahlo in the Provincial Legislature says Mhlahlo had a solution to most problems. “Very cool! He took things very cool. He laughed about them but he came with a solution. It’s true that he was a very astute politician and he would approach things always from the angle of politics typical of a worker-leader, because he was a worker-leader while he was still outside the country,” says Maxhegwana.
