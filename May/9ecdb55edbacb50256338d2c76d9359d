The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the delays in announcing the Gauteng provincial cabinet are having a negative impact on service delivery. Premier David Makhura was scheduled to announce Members of his Executive Council on Tuesday afternoon. However, the announcement was postponed to a date yet to be announced. DA Caucus Leader in the Gauteng Legislature Solly Msimanga has urged the Premier to make the appointments urgently so government work does not stall. In a statement released earlier on Tuesday, the Gauteng Provincial Government said Premier David Makhura would no longer announce his MECs on Tuesday, as he was still consulting with others within the ruling party. The DA in Gauteng says it has learnt that the delays are due to infighting among African National Congress (ANC) members as they jostle for positions. The party’s Solly Msimanga says this clearly shows that these members only care about positions and not the needs of Gauteng residents. Msimanga says the Premier’s decision must not only be based on struggle credentials, but must also be about competence and dedication to public service.
