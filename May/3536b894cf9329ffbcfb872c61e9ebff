A 40-year-old man believed to be a tourist has drowned while swimming with his wife at the Bronze beach in Umhlanga Rocks in Durban. Netcare 911’s Shaun Herbst says initial reports indicate that a man got into difficulty while swimming. He says emergency services together with police search and rescue unit later recovered the body. “Shortly after 9 o’clock Sunday morning Netcare 911 responded to report of drowning. A man, believed to be a foreign tourist, is presumed to have drowned when he got into difficulty while swimming in the non-swimming beach north of Bronze beach, Umhlanga Rocks.  According to witnesses on the scene, the man had been swimming with his wife when he went under. The man has been presumed drowned due to the length he has already been submerged,” says Herbst.
