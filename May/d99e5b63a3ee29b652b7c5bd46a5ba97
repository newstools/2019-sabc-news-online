 The Economic Freedom Fighters  (EFF) in the Free State has called for a fresh investigation into the controversial Estina dairy project in Vrede. This after the High Court in Pretoria declared Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s report on the Vrede Dairy Farm project, unconstitutional and invalid. The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (CASAC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) approached the court to set aside the report which was released by Busisiwe Mkhwebane, accusing her of protecting politicians such as African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule, during her investigation. Free State EFF leader, Mandisa Makheseni says the public protector’s report was one sided. “The EFF has been proven right once again on what happened at the Vrede Dairy Estina Farm. The investigations were not done correctly; they didn’t hear two sides of the story, it was only one sided. So let them do the right thing to the benefit of the people so that everyone who has been proven to have a hand in whatever that happened in that project. In the manner the investigation the investigation was done is not.” The Free State government has, in a statement, acknowledged the judgment and said will respond if necessary. However, it maintains that it was not party to the case as they were not cited as an interested party by the applicants. WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
