The only surviving suspect in the murder of the seven members of the Khoza family in Vlakfontein south of Johannesburg is on Tuesday expected back in the Lenasia Magistrates Court in Johannesburg. The 61-year-old Fita Khupe faces seven counts of murder. His co-accused Ernest Mabaso was found dead in a police holding cell in Cape Town in January. The court is awaiting a decision of the Directorate of Public Prosecutions on where this case will be tried. The members of the Khoza family, three women and four children were found buried under a heap of sand at their home Vlakfontein in October last year.
