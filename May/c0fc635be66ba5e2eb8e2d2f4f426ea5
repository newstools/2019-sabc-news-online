Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says more traffic officers are needed on the country’s roads because of the growing number of cars using the thousands of kilometres of tarmac. He says a recruitment drive will take place later this year. Nzimande was speaking in Pretoria while releasing the the Easter weekend death toll stats which showed a decrease of 48% compared to last year. Nzimande says the number of fatalities recorded were 162 as compared to 309 last year. KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape top the list of highest road fatalities.  He says: ” I am pleased to announce that the number of fatalities decreased by 48% from 309 in 2018 to 162 in 2019. This marks a decrease of 147 fatalities. However, government is still concerned even by a single loss of life on our roads. All provinces recorded decreases in number of fatalities Nzimande says police visibility contributed to the massive drop in deaths but has conceded that the school holidays falling outside the Easter weekend also played a role. He added that the disregard for the rules of the road remains a serious concern. He also warned that the demerit point system is on the way and errant drivers will have to change their ways.
