Former President Jacob Zuma‘s lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane has told the Pietermaritzburg High Court that he will reveal details from the spy tapes about individuals wanting to trap his client. Zuma and French Arms company Thales are facing corruption, money laundering and racketeering charges relating to the multi-billion Rand arms deal. Delivering his argument for a permanent stay of prosecution, Sikhakhane says Zuma’s legal team has been accused by the media of delaying tactics. “I’m going to try and persuade everyone who has hated this man without thinking once about him. We have not come here to do what our learned friends and people in the media call it. They say we are adopting a stalingrad approach, that we are here to delay because that’s what Zuma does. I promise you, I’m going to read to you a discussion between a prosecutor and an outsider seeking to trap Mr Zuma.” Watch for more:
