The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape says the 7% decline in voter support is worrying, adding that things could have been worse. The party has lost a lot of supporters in Franscis Baard as well as the John Taolo Gaetsewe Districts. In 2014, the governing party took the Northern Cape with 64.40% of the votes. This year, however, it’s only managed to secure 57% of the provincial vote. The  Democratic Alliance (DA) retains its status as the provincial official opposition party with 25%. It is followed by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) which has won 10 % of the ballots cast. Speaking at a media briefing in Kimberley, ANC provincial secretary, Deshi Ngxanga, said corruption and internal divisions discouraged voters. “There is this issue of state capture in a way impacted how people view us as an organisation, but also as a government if people perceive the government to be corrupt obviously they will be discouraged to go and vote. But there is also this sensitive issue of internal strife in the organisation, once there is internal strife it will discourage people to go and vote.” More on the elections coverage:
