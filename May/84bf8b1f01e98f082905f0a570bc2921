Former Justice Portfolio Committee Chairperson, Doctor Mathole Motshekga, says the incoming sixth Parliament may well consider resuscitating the inquiry into the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. This follows the North Gauteng High Court’s ruling that she failed in her duties to investigate and report on the Vrede dairy project in the Free State. The court found that Vrede Dairy Project report was unconstitutional and invalid and set aside. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fate has been hanging in the balance since her appointment in October 2016. She was accused of being a former spy, an accusation she intends to fight in court. Parliament’s Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio Committee also considered an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. This Inquiry was held in abeyance.
This after a court found that she had overstepped her powers on her remedial action wanting to change the mandate of the South African Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank wants the Constitutional Court to declare that Mkhwebane abused her office. The Concourt is yet to rule on the cost order against her.
This means that the Public Protector has two adverse findings against her office. According to Motshekga, these rulings are likely to be debated in Parliament. “I have no doubt if you take her into account, the question of the Reserve Bank and this question, people will go back to these issues and say is this person fit to hold office? So I don’t know how we escape from this but I think it is a reminder to all of us that the process determines the outcome.”
