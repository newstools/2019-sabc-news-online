The newly-formed Land Party has expelled five of its members, including its national coordinator Maxwell Mothlake and communications head Bantu Gwija. Party spokesperson, Mandy Owens, says they were expelled for misrepresenting the party, tarnishing its reputation and image and gross misconduct. She says the party has also opened a case of crimen injuria and defamation against its former Premier candidate for the Western Cape, Loyiso Nkohla. Nkohla resigned last week, apparently to avoid being expelled. Owens says Nkohla tendered his resignation following a number of allegations that were made against him. These include allegations of sexual harassment, threats of violence and defamation of character.
