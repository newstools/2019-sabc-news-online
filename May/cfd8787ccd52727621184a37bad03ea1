Members of the public have criticised the cost of this weekend’s inauguration of President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria. Last week, Minister in the Presidency Dr Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma announced that it will cost around R120 million, which is R100-million less than the inauguration of former president Jacob Zuma in 2014. It’s the first time the inauguration won’t be held at the Union Buildings. “It’s very ridiculous to spend so much money on just a one day event. I mean they could have used the Union Buildings whereby they didn’t have to pay a cent for it and rather use the money for us to fix things,” says a member of the public “That’s a lot of money because where I’m coming from we are lacking roads, last time they tried to fix the road, and they made it worse, this money is too much,” says another. “I think for them spending that money for five hours on Loftus Versverld, its waste of time and money.”
