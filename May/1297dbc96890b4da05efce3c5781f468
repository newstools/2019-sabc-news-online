A newly modernised Home Affairs office has officially been opened in Stellenbosch in the Western Cape which aims to improve services. The new office model is equipped with modern infrastructure and technology aimed at digitising the paperwork. It’s the beginning of a new era for government services that are modernised, hopefully to fast-track service delivery. The launch of the new upgraded infrastructure has been created with the key objective to migrate from a manual to a paperless environment. Home Affairs Deputy Minister Fatima Cohan says the newly improved way of applications and collection of new documents is long overdue. The new technology and new office form part of the Home Affairs Modernisation Program. It has been well received by some who are no longer forced to tolerate long queues. The program also focuses on speeding up civic services like the birth registrations. The Deputy Minister visited the Stellenbosch Public Hospital to encourage mothers to register their children at Home Affairs offices provided at some Hospitals within 30 days of giving birth.
