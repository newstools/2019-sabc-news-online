The African National Congress (ANC) support dropped to below 60% for the first time since 1994, however the party is set to rule for the next five years after winning the 6th national elections. The 6th Parliament will see gains and losses for some political parties while welcoming new comers. Assistant Researcher at the Society, Work and Politics Institute Tasneem Essop said, “Some of it was expected, I think the stagnation of the DA, the increase of the EFF was also an important part of this and where the ANC eventually fell – between what many said would be 57% and some said it would be 60%. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) announced the official election results in Pretoria over the weekend showing that the ANC got 57.50% of the votes. WATCH
