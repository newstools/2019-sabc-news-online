The first black African woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest has returned to South Africa to a hero’s welcome.  South African, Saray Khumalo arrived at O.R Tambo International airport in Johannesburg on Monday morning. At least ten people have lost their lives trying to reach the peak of the highest mountain in the world in the past week. Khumalo says she is grateful for her achievement, “There are many more mountains to climb and more work to be done in a nutshell. Watch the space as we keep moving forward one step at a time. When you don’t succeed the first time, try and try again because the summit is only a step away. Thank you so much for your support.” Click link for more on the story:
