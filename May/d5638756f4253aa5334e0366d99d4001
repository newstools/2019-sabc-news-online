Mining mogul and the owner of Mamelodi Sundowns football club, Patrice Motsepe and BLF Leader Andile Mngxitama will on Tuesday battle it out in the Johannesburg High Court. Motsepe took Mngxitama to court after he (Mngxitama) accused him of being part of those “craving Botswana diamonds”. The mining magnate went to court interdicting Mngxitama to stop making comments about him. Mngxitama has confirmed he made these comments but is not prepared to refrain from continuing with the accusations. The court battle comes after Mngxitama linked Motsepe with the current allegations that his sister Bridgette Radebe, wife of energy minister Jeff Radebe was part of the people who were interfering in the political affairs of Botswana. Radebe has since dismissed these accusations. Meanwhile, the Botswana government has taken drastic steps by issuing a notice that she can only enter Botswana when she has applied for a visa.
