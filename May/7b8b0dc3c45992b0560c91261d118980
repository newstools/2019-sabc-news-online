The death toll from Monday’s multiple-car crash on the N3 in Vosloorus east of Johannesburg has risen to 10. The collision which happened near the Barry Marais off-ramp involved four light motor vehicles and four trucks. At least 20 other people sustained injuries. Preliminary investigations suggest that poor visibility could have contributed to the collisions. Paramedics arrived to find several patients lying trapped inside the mangled vehicles and about 20 others scattered on the scene. Acting CEO of the Thelle Mogoerane hospital in Vosloorus, Dr Michael Malaka, says they received about seven patients on Monday night one of which later passed away. “It was a female patient with head injuries and blunt abdominal injury. The patient was booked for theatre and later died in theatre.” Simon Zwane from the Road Traffic Management Corporation says, “There was a veld fire which could have affected visibility in that area leading one truck to stop in the middle of the road and others to collide with the truck from behind.” Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele adds: “A case of culpable homicide and reckless and negligence is under investigation.” No one has been arrested.
