The man accused of shooting and killing a Vaal student last year has been found guilty of premeditated murder in the high court in Johannesburg sitting at the Palm Ridge court on Gauteng’s Eastrand. The 30-year-old Lebohang Mofokeng is on trial for the murder of 22-year-old Jabulile Nhlapo his ex-girlfriend. Nhlapo was fatally shot at a student commune in Vanderbijlpark in May 2018. Judge Herman Broodryk described Mofokeng as a self-confessed liar. He says Mofokeng’s evidence was contradictory and that he did not take any responsibility for his actions. The Judge accuses Mofokeng of not being interested in the court proceedings. He rejected all of Mofokeng’s version of events on that fateful day saying it was clear the accused wanted to kill Nhlapo. The Vaal student was shot and killed at her residence. Mofokeng has told the court that he had stolen his father’s gun. He claims a scuffle led to the murder. Mofokeng will know his fate on Tuesday.
