Family and friends have described the late former Eastern Cape Transport and Public Works MEC, Thobile Mhlahlo as a loving family man. Mhlahlo passed away on Saturday at St George’s Hospital in Port Elizabeth after a short-illness. He will be laid to rest on Saturday next week. His daughter Nomathamsanqa Mbambe says: “He was a very loving father, he sacrificed a lot of us. We are where we are because of his sacrifices. He not only loved his family but he loved everyone. He helped everyone there are so many people that he helped and groomed. We will remember him as the loving father.” His longtime friend, Lunga Magxaka says Mhlahlo was an ardent and knowledgeable jazz lover. “He had a love of jazz. He would say Lunga I’m going to play today because I’m expecting so and so is coming to visit me at the club today. He had that in his heart. He was at the club on Saturday before he was admitted to St George’s Hospital. We shared some jokes with him and he decided to leave the club early that day.”
