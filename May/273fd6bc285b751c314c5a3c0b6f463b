She was delivering the 2019 Archbishop Thabo Makgoba Development Trust Public Lecture at the University of the Western Cape on Tuesday. “When we’re saying we want people of integrity to go to Parliament and who will preserve it, we’re meaning people who’ll be true to their calling” says Prof Madonsela. The lecture is an annual event that promotes critical dialogue about integrity and leadership in South Africa.
