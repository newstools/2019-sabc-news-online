The African National Congress’ (ANC) ward 52 councillor in the eThekwini Metro, Boxer Zulu, says he fears for the safety of his family after the murder of two metro police officers outside his Bambayi home, north of Durban on Monday night. The two officers were stationed outside his home for the past year as it was believed that his life was in danger. Both officers, an elderly man close to retirement age and a young woman, were shot and killed by unknown men. Zulu says he suspects the incident may be related to service delivery issues. “I just heard the gunshot next to the gate. I opened the window and I saw a quarrel at the gate where police are stationed, they are normally guarding my house. I tried to open the door to see what was happening. When I came close, I saw that the police personnel have been shot dead by faceless guns and that’s when I decided to retaliate,” explains Zulu.
