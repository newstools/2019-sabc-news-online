The authors of the research into the cognitive study on coloured women have retracted their article, according to a statement. The article by researchers at the University of Stellenbosch received backlash from both the academia and the public. The study, labelled by some as racist on social media, assessed 60 coloured women between the ages of 18 and 64. It found that they present with low cognitive function, which is significantly influenced by education. The results were been published in a scientific journal. The Editors and the Publisher have taken the decision to retract the article. The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as “Retracted”.
