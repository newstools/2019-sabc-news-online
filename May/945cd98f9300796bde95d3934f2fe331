The case against a man who is facing charges of the repeated rape of his two daughters has been postponed until next month by the eZingolweni Magistrate’s Court in Kwazulu Natal. The man, who cannot be name to protect the identity of the children, allegedly repeatedly molested his two daughters since they were four years old. The man remains in police custody. In postponing the matter Magistrate Winston Mzanywa said it was important that the state attorney interview the victims before the accused can apply for bail. Founder of NGO, Mother of Nation, Mathabiso Cele  led locals to court to oppose the bail application. “One of his daughters fell pregnant and gave birth and it was reported that even after giving birth the suspect was still sexually abusing the victim. So we are very heart broken as a community because in January where we were standing here at Ezingolweni protesting against bail being granted to a suspect who has been accused of raping a two year old and today that suspect is released back to our community and we are very sad because there perpetrators are arrested today but tomorrow are out. We feel it should stop,” says Cele. Early this year in the same community another man accused of raping a two year old baby girl was released on bail by eZingolweni Magistrates court. Now the community members say they are living in fear for their children.
