Department of Water and Sanitation workers affiliated to South African Municipal Workers’ Union have reportedly resumed their strike in some parts of the Durban CBD. Various roads in and around the city have been closed to traffic due to the protesting workers. The eThekwini municipality has halted the pay grade adjustment process for Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans working in the city’s water department that led to the strike action. Trucks have been moved from blocking the N3 toll road and some parts of New Germany in Durban. Currently West Street in the CBD has been closed to traffic as workers continue with the strike for salary increments. Water, electricity and DSW trucks are currently blocking the street. Police are redirecting traffic to alternative routes. The streets have been littered with thrash, however police are on scene monitoring the situation.
