The African National Congress (ANC) communications section has cleared the confusion between its communications and media liaison personnel. Pule Mabe is the ANC national spokesperson while the former acting national spokesperson, Dakota Legoete will go back to his old position of party organiser. This emerged during a joint press briefing by both Mabe and Legoete, alongside Secretary General Ace Magashule in Pretoria. Legoete says all media inquiries should now be directed to Mabe. “Being the Deputy Head of organising, dealing with membership, political organisations and education. That’s what I’m going to do, full time. I’ll only come in through interventions. Yes, whenever there are problems. Pule went on study leave, well there’s no problems,” explains Legoete.
