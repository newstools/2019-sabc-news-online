Home Affairs says Gauteng, the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal have the most uncollected Smart ID cards. Eligible voters need their IDs, whether card or green book to cast their ballots. Many of the people who visited Home Affairs offices to collect their Smart card IDs or green ID books say they’re determined to vote on Wednesday in the general elections. “The reason I’m here is because of my daughter’s ID as she is going to matric. So that is why I came here so that she can get an ID. Maybe she might be lucky and vote tomorrow (Wednesday). If everything goes well I think she is going to vote. I’m here to get my ID because I also want to vote tomorrow. It’s a big day for voting. I’m ready I’m waiting for the day of tomorrow.” Meanwhile, Home Affairs is extending working hours until election day on Wednesday. This is to enable citizens to collect their IDs to vote. On Tuesday offices will be open from 7 am to  5 pm and on Wednesday it will open from 7 am to 9 pm. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
