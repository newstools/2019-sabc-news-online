Pilots, who are preparing to fly over the Loftus Versfeld stadium during the presidential inauguration, have emphasized their role in Saturday’s proceedings. The well anticipated aerial salute will take place alongside members of the army, navy, military service, air force, and the national ceremonial guard. The presidential aircraft will also be part of the flypast. President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to be sworn-in as the head of the sixth administration. Captain Andre Steenkamp explains the importance of timing during the flypast… “We’re using the A34600, two of them, and the silver falcons – 6 of them. We will be formatting on me as their leader – three on each side of the wing. Time wise you have to fly over the stadium at an exact time that they give you and we are talking about within seconds. So to plan all that takes a bit of pre-planning. And as well as flying the aircraft stable because we have 7 other aircraft that is under you. You have to look after their safety so we don’t go too low because they don’t look to the ground, they look at you.”
