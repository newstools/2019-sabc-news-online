Residents of Plettenberg Bay in the Southern Cape have mixed reactions following the official opening a new Magistrate’s Court in the area. The R300 million project was officially opened by Justice Minister Michael Masutha. Some residents say they are grateful that they won’t have to travel to Knysna for court cases while others say housing should have been a priority. “We’re very proud and happy for the court opening today. Because there will be facilities for people to come to because there’s no need to go to Knysna for court,” says a resident. “This isn’t actually what we want in our area. We want houses, because the last time we had houses is about 23 years ago. Everyone is happy today, but tomorrow we’ll be sad again,” adds a resident.
