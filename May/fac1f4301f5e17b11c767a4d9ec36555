African Transformation Movement (ATM)’s Head of Policy, Mzwanele Manyi says the political landscape in the country is about to change.  Manyi says now the time has come for servant leadership, accountability and an end to corruption and looting. Addressing the media on Wednesday afternoon, Manyi says public servants must put the South African society first. It is a road to Damascus for ATM, sailing from nowhere with limited resources and ending up with two seats in both the National Assembly and Provincial Legislatures. One is in the Eastern Cape and another in KwaZulu-Natal. “Now we stand proud as one of the biggest winners in the 2019 national and provincial elections, new entrants’ category,” says ATM Head of Policy. The ATM leadership says the time for real work has begun to transform South Africa and bring about a responsible and values driven government. “We will restore faith in government and we will purify the current status quo, including the responsibility we all have towards ensuring that we are responsible citizens.” Citing among others, on Wednesday morning the arrest of the eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, the Zondo Commission and endless service delivery protests, Manyi said mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that such occurrences do not show face again. Responding to high unemployment rate in the country, the party put the blame solely on what it called failed economic policies which in the main favour big business and disadvantage Small and Medium Enterprises which are job creators. With the National Assembly about to resume its duties, the ATM says its posture will not be an opportunist party, arguing without making a meaningful contribution. Theirs will be progressive and constructive in the interest of the people of South Africa. Click below for more on the story:
