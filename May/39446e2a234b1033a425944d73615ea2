The founder of the “right to die” organisation, Dignity SA, Professor Sean Davison, is set to return to the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Friday on three charges of premeditated murder. The 58-year-old advocate for assisted suicide was arrested last year at his Pinelands home for the death in 2013 of his friend, Anrich Burger, who became a quadriplegic after a car crash. The second charge relates to the 2015 death of Justin Varian, who had motor neuron disease. The third charge relates to the death of triathlete, Richard Holland, who was paralysed after a cycling accident. Davison is accused of administering a lethal amount of drugs to the 32-year-old Holland in November 2015 in Constantia. Davison is out on bail of R20 000.
