The Pietermaritzburg High Court will on Tuesday hear heads of argument by the legal team representing the French arms company Thales, along with former President Jacob Zuma. The team is seeking that charges against them be permanently dropped. The case involves 783 questionable payments to Zuma allegedly received from the company in connection with the multi-billion rand arms deal. The State alleges that the total payments of R1.2 million paid to Zuma by his convicted former financial adviser Schabir Shaik was a bribe. In 1997, Thales won a R2.6 billion stake in South Africa’s arms acquisition programme. On Monday, Zuma’s legal counsel Muzi Sikhakhane said that the case was at the “intersection of law and politics” and that Zuma faced “mob justice” and “lynching” due to prejudice against him.
