 President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Wednesday evening reveal the much-anticipated composition of the national executive. The Presidency has announced that President Ramaphosa will make the announcement from the Union Buildings in Tshwane at 8pm. Meanwhile, SABC news has reliably learnt that President Ramaphosa has officially written to Parliament to inform it of the date he wants to deliver his state of the nation address. Once the President’s letter has been considered by the Presiding Officers, it will be processed. Section 84 of the constitution gives the president the power to summon Parliament for an extraordinary sitting to conduct special business. The State of the Nation Address is an annual event called by the President to address the Nation through a joint sitting of Parliament. Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo confirmed that President Ramaphosa has communicated the date to Parliament. Mothapo says, “The Presiding officers of Parliament Mme Thandi Modise and NCOP Chairperson Ntate Masondo received a letter from the President informing them of the date for the first SONA for the Sixth Democratic Parliament. The President has indicated that the joint sitting of those two houses to enable him to deliver his SONA will take place on the 20th of June at 19:00.”
