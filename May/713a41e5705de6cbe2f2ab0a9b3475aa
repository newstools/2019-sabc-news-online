The United Nations Secretary General and the Executive Director of UN Women have praised the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint a gender-balanced cabinet. This makes South Africa the 11th country globally to meet this benchmark and just the third in Africa after Rwanda and Ethiopia. The President of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, also lauded the move as a decision that will benefit not only in South Africa but the entire region. UN Women’s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka says:”I am very excited that South Africa now has a gender-balanced cabinet. I want to congratulate the President and the Cabinet, and we commit ourselves to support them and to work with them every step of the way.” “It’s an exciting cabinet also because it’s so diverse. There’s new blood, younger people; and we are excited that we also have strong people like Thoko Didiza in a complex department.” “She is formidable on Agriculture. She understands the subject but also land reform which is a very complex issue in South Africa right now. Now it’s going to be also in the hands of someone who also knows how to engage both communities at a very complex level.” Click video below:  Related video click below:
