 It’s back to business as usual at the SABC Radio Park in Auckland Park. That’s after the building was declared safe by the Johannesburg Fire Chief on Sunday following a diesel leak last week. For five days, operations had been halted because of a diesel spill. 5FM DJ and Radio Personality Nick Hamman says, “It was quite interesting because I was half way through with my show and at about 10:30 we were told there has been a leak and then told to leave the building. People left, EMS was here, it’s the first time something like this has happened since I have been here.” Radio 2000 sports producer, Timmy T Maranda says, “It’s been very difficult because my work at the station is at K2 underground. So we didn’t have an entrance to the work station.” SABC Tours Mandla Blose adds, “We had to cancel some of the tours and move them. Some were already here and it was awkward so we had to do what we had to do. Safety comes first but we are happy to be back.” Emergency services had to be called on site after several days of mopping up, the Johannesburg Fire Chief on Sunday declared the building safe. Johannesburg Emergency spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says, “We have done a last inspection together with the safety team from SABC. So the building has been given the green light to reopen and operate.” However, the lingering smell in the air is still unsettling. “I don’t think the diesel is yet clear because it still smells,” says one employee.  Another one adds, “We can still smell diesel here and there, but they assured us that everything is done and that we are safe.” The SABC released a statement over the weekend. A detailed report on the incident will be submitted to the Department of Labour. Watch related videos below for more on the story:
