Transnet Executive Manager for Governance, Peter Volmink, is expected to continue giving testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture when proceedings resume on Friday morning. On Thursday, Volmink told the commission that former Transnet Chief Executive, Brian Molefe, rescinded a decision taken by the tender evaluation team in order to award a company of his choice. Volmink says there is a culture of bullying at Transnet where senior officials put pressure on employees to act outside of the organisation’s procedural requirements. Volmink said that Transnet awarded McKinsey Consulting agency eight contracts, with a combined value of approximately R1.6 billion  outside Transnet’s proper procurement processes. He said that the deviation from the company’s normal open tender process happened despite the fact that there were no grounds to pursue a closed tender. Watch a related video below:
