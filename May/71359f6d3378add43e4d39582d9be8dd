Statistician General Risenga Maluleke says incidents of double voting had no adverse impact on the outcome on the recent 2019 national and provincial elections. The Statistician General was roped in to investigate the credibility of the polls after reports of multiple voting emerged. Statistics South Africa says the validation exercise was carried out independently and was based on data received from 1 020 voting stations. The report was compiled after small parties expressed concerns that the poll was not free and fair. Maluleke says, “What we did was a sample quality assurance to the voter’s districts in relation to the votes that were cast from the data received from the IEC. So we didn’t go door-to-door or voting station to voting station because by the time we were called in, the voting had already been completed.” The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) released Maluleke’s report on Thursday. It revealed that there were “negligible risks” from double-voting in last Wednesday’s general election. Click on related videos:
