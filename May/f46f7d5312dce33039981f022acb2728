The Land Party says its Premier candidate, Loyiso Nkohla, has resigned to avoid being expelled from the party. Land Party spokesperson, Mandy Owens, says Nkohla tendered his resignation on Thursday following a number of allegations that were made against him this weekend. These include allegations of sexual harassment, threats of violence and defamation of character.   Owens says evidence of the allegations is to be presented to the party’s central committee for investigation. “We are hugely relieved the party is going through a cleansing process and we are getting rid of people who are in the party for self-promotion. So for us it is a victory. We move forward to grow the party with people who are truly in it for the right reasons and that is to serve the people in our communities,” says Owen. The party has, according to their social media pages, accepted Nkohla’s resignation.
