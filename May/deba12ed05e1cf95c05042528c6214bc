Community members have held a prayer rally in the gang ravaged northern areas of Port Elizabeth. Gang violence in the area claimed the life of a 22-year-old man on Saturday. The latest death brings the total number of people killed in three weeks to 12. Under the banner “one voice one vision,” churches and community members marched together against the scourge. Bethelsdorp is ranked among the top 30 most dangerous areas in South Africa while Gelvandale, also in the northern areas, tops the national list in terms of attempted murder. SAPS spokesperson, Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana, says more personnel will be dispatched to the area. “We are going to disperse more people to the northern areas to help the existing team on the ground and we are going to continue fighting the scourge of gang wars.” Last week, three junior schools where closed following a shootout where community members say about 30 to 40 gunshots were fired. Community leader, Michelle Rossouw, says they have been living in fear for too long. A special task team continues to work the area. WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
