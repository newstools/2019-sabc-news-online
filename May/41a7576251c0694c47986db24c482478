 The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg says it has yet to see a report cited by Mayor Herman Mashaba which allegedly reveals that corruption cases amounting to a staggering R33 billion are under investigation in the city. Mashaba tweeted that the city’s Group Forensic Investigation department was investigating. Mashaba will formally present a detailed report to council in June, with a list of all the corruption cases that he says are currently under investigation. The Joburg Mayor says he has also written to Hawks head General Godfrey Lebeya as well as National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Advocate Shamila Bathoi, demanding answers as to why there have been no prosecutions related to the alleged corruption. Joburg ANC spokesperson Jolidee Matongo says:”We have on numerous occasions asked the Mayor to present a report to council tabling all these cases and this has not happened in the last 24 months.” “This particular figure which is branded by the Mayor started at R8 billion and the last time we checked it was R24 million and today it’s surprising R33 billion.” “We think that the Mayor must just present a report to council tabling all the cases and their amounts and then the prosecuting authority and the law enforcement authorities must do their work.” Click video below:
