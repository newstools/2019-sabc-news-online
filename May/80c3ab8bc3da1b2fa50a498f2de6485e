Schools were forced to close in Ga-Selepe, outside Lebowakgomo, Limpopo. The disruption started early on Tuesday when residents took to the streets demanding a tarred road. Community leader, Sakkie Mokgoba, says that the government has been making promises to construct a 24 km tarred road for the past two decades. “This road has been promised to be on designed stage from April 2016 and up to date we have not heard any response from the MEC and the Premier himself. So we did go to them and the entire process giving the memorandum and they have not given us anything; they just said they don’t have budget for the road.” Scores of schools have been shut in the middle of mid-year examinations and learners are worried about their future. Residents have vowed to remain on the streets until their demands are met. Public works department says this road is on their master plan and it will be attend immediately when they get funds.
