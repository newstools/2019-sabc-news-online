Political Analyst Asanda Ngoasheng says Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane‘s resignation is imminent. She says the DA is a party in turmoil and has an identity crisis. There have been calls on social media for Maimane to be fired as the leader of the party after the DA’s decline in support in last week’s elections. “I believe that we should expect Mmusi Maimane’s resignation very soon because Mmusi Maimane has failed as a leader. He failed in his bid to be City of Jhb Mayor, he failed in his bid to be the Premier of Gauteng, he failed in his bid to lead the official opposition in Parliament because when he was in Parliament the EFF set the agenda, and the EFF was one that became the official opposition even though the DA had bigger numbers. It does not surprise me that there are rumours that Mmusi is going to be kicked out of the DA,” says Ngoasheng. Click below for more on the story:
