The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says former Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan should not be appointed to cabinet until he has cleared his name. President Cyril Ramphosa will announce his national executive later this week. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of improper conduct for the decision he made as Finance Minister to grant former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay early retirement with full benefits. She has recommended that President Cyril Ramphosa take disciplinary steps against Gordhan. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says Pravin Gordhan must be held accountable for any wrongdoing and should seek recourse to challenge the findings. He says it’s not a good idea to include him in cabinet when he still has a cloud hanging over his head. “The story ends there and he must not be appointed as a result into the cabinet until he clears his name. He can always be appointed any time but let’s not portray a situation as if Pravin Gordhan is untouchable and cannot be held accountable. We reject that,” says Ndlozi. Meanwhile, Gordhan’s lawyer Tebogo Malatji has already filed court papers to review the Public Protector’s report. Watch related video:
