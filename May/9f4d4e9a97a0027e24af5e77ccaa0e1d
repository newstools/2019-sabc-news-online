The trial of the two people implicated in the Allelluia International Ministries resurrection is set to begin in June. Nkululeko Dlamini and Silungisani Grace Sibanda appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s court on Thursday morning on charges of fraud. They were arrested following their involvement in the infamous resurrection of a man that was performed at the church in February. A video appearing of a man resurrecting from the dead put charismatic churches under the spotlight also causing a social media frenzy. Dlamini and Sibanda face fraud charges. They allegedly organised the delivery of Brighton ‘Elliot’ Moyo in the coffin. The court previously heard that personal details in Dlamini’s passport and South African identity document don’t match. To make matters worse it’s also emerged that he shares an ID with two other people. Home Affairs has requested the three to submit their ID’s for verification. The state pushed for postponement, arguing it needs more time to compile new information on Dlamini. The defence however disagreed, saying that the state had ample time to prepare. The trial is expected to start on the 12th of June. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
