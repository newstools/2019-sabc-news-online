African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule has reiterated his stance that no one is above the party. He was reacting to widespread views that the ANC only won the recent elections because of the popularity of president Cyril Ramaphosa. Magashule has, however, conceded that as party leader, Ramaphosa energised the ANC’s election campaign. The secretary-general was addressing the media in Irene, Pretoria, on Monday, where the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) is holding a special meeting to discuss premier-elect candidates for the 8 provinces in which the party governs. “Ramaphosa works as part of the collective. The campaign was energised by the leadership of Ramaphosa working together with the collective …” Magashule says the ANC will reflect on the outcome of the recent elections, but not at the special NEC meeting. “We are going to have a fully fledged NEC meeting. Because we have to analyse each and every aspects of elections, outcomes. So not today.” The ANC NEC is currently holding a special meeting to decide on who to elect as Premiers of the eight provinces led by the party. There will be new Premiers, new ministers and deputy ministers. New MPs will also fill the benches of the National Assembly and NCOP. Questionable names on the ANC’s list for parliament could also be reviewed. The list has to be submitted to parliament by Wednesday. The ANC will communicate the outcome of the meeting during the course of this week.  Watch video below:
