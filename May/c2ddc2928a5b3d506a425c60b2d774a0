Minister in the Presidency Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says cost cutting measures were taken into consideration when deciding on the presidential inauguration venue. For the first time, the President will be inaugurated at Loftus Versveld Stadium in Pretoria instead of the traditional Union Buildings. The Inter-Ministerial committee on the Presidential Inauguration led by Dlamini-Zuma briefed the media in Pretoria on the state of readiness to host the 2019 Presidential Inauguration. Dlamini-Zuma says government will be spending over R100 million less on this year’s Presidential Inauguration – than it did in 2014. Presidency last month announced that R120 million has been earmarked for the inauguration. “The choice of the venue was determined by a number of factors, I’ll just mention few. The costs, because preparing the amphitheater is more costly than hiring a stadium but the other important reason is that there is going to be an inclusive programme where everyone will be seeing everything at the same place at the same time instead of others being at the amphitheater  and others on the lawns.” Watch for more:
