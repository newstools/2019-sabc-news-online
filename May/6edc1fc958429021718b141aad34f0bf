The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Gauteng says it’s disappointed that MEC Panyaza Lesufi is going back to being Education MEC. Lesufi was on Wednesday announced as the new Finance and e-Government MEC. However, in a statement on Friday, Premier David Makhura says he has decided to return Lesufi to the Education Portfolio following complaints and feedback from various stakeholders that he should continue at the Department of Education. MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko, who was initially announced as Education MEC, will now take over at Finance and e-Government. EFF Gauteng chairperson Mandisa Mashego says Lesufi has failed to address structural challenges in the education system. “We think that the hype about Panyaza is based on his Public Relations. Panyaza has never been able to competently address the racism that the black children are subjected to in so-called former model c schools, which are in the higher quintile.” “Majority of government schools do not have sporting facilities, they do not have laboratories, they do not have libraries, maybe a new face would have been a blessing, and he gets thrown there in treasury.” Click video below:
