 The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has dismissed an application seeking clarity on the Constitutionality of a ruling allowing gay pastors from the Dutch Reformed Church to continue with their same sex unions. The Alliance Defending the Autonomy of Churches in SA (Adacsa) had launched the bid. The court dismissed Adacsa’s application, saying the matter was settled and the church had accepted the court’s decision on the matter. Laurie Gaum, who took the Dutch Reformed Church to court for being against same sex marriage, was opposing the legal challenge. His brother, Andre says the family is pleased with Friday’s ruling. “It was always a fight for justice, a fight to make sure that there is no unfair discrimination on people against on the basis of their sexual orientation. An application to apply and comply with the Constitution of the Republic, a fight for justice and therefore they are over the moon that this is now the end of this matter and that they have come out victorious as far as the matter is concerned,” says Gaum.
