Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, says she is considering her legal options, including a possible approach to the Constitutional Court, following the Pretoria High Court’s decision to set aside her report into the Estina Dairy Farm Project at Vrede in the Free State. The court ruled Mkhwebane failed to do her job with due diligence and also failed to properly investigate those implicated in the R200 million Vrede dairy farm scandal. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and others had approached the Public Protector to probe the alleged involvement of then Free State Premier Ace Magashule and others in the matter. Judge Ronel Tolmay declared the Public Protector’s report invalid and unconstitutional. Speaking on the SABC’s Morning Live programme, Mkhwebane says she will make public the draft report on the controversial Estina Dairy Farm project which was compiled by her predecessor, Thuli Madonsela. She has hit back at the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (CASAC), who accuse her of altering the report to protect politicians such as ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule.
