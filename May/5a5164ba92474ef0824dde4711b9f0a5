 Transnet Executive Manager for Governance, Peter Volmink, will return to the hot seat at the Zondo Commission probing allegations of state capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Friday morning. On Thursday, Volmink implicated former Transnet Chief Executive, Brian Molefe, in his testimony. He alleges that Molefe overruled a decision of the company’s tender evaluation team to award a contract to a firm of his choice. Volmink says there’s a culture of bullying at the parastatal, in which senior officials put pressure on employees to act outside of the organisation’s procedures. He says Transnet flouted procurement processes and awarded McKinsey Consulting agency eight contracts worth about R1.6-billion. The company’s governance manager says the deviation from tender rules happened despite the fact that there were no grounds to pursue a closed tender.  Click video below:
