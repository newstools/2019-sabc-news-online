President Cyril Ramaphosa says investors should not be deterred from seeking investment opportunities in the country – amid the land reform debate in South Africa. Ramaphosa was speaking at an investor conference in Westcliff, Johannesburg. He has assured potential investors that land grabs will not be tolerated if and when land is being expropriated. “Investors should not be worried about that. The constitution does allow for land to be expropriated, but there will never be land grabs. We will not allow land grabs to happen. We say to people do not fear. This is a process that has to address the original sin, but it takes into account the current imperatives and does it carefully in terms of the rule of law,” he adds. Click related video below:
