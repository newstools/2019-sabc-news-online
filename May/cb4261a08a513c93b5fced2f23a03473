There has been additional allegations of maladministration in the Alex Renewal Project. This emerged during a joint hearing by the Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector’s office. They are probing the violent protests that erupted in the run-up to elections. Three spheres of government are expected to account. Service delivery failures and the mushrooming of shacks again accentuated. “The infrastructure that we have is obviously designed for a certain number of people, and once the place becomes overpopulated, obviously it will affect the services,” says Alex Total Shutdown Spokesperson, Bobby Solomons. They want officials on the ground to stop land grabs. Alex Total Shutdown convenor, Sandile Mavundla says, “It’s surprising when people invade capitalists’ land like waterfall, they will go there and stop people but when it’s in Alexandra they don’t respond.” The multi-million rand Alex Renewal Project also took centre stage. “The mood was very high, we were so excited thinking finally we are going to get houses, after our houses were demolished and ARP saying we will be paying rent to our fellow neighbours of which you are going to pay R700 for two rooms, or R350 for one room,” says  Anti-Rental Committee Secretary, Malebo Mokgabudi. Allegations of corruption in the presidential project will be probed. “The office of Public Protection will then investigate maladministration in particular to try and establish the money that was allocated to the Alexandra renewal project, were did that money go?,” says Nelisiwe Thejane from the office of the Public Protector. “We see this as the start of many other collaborations to investigate human rights abuses and also to promote good governance in Gauteng and South Africa,” says  SA Human Rights Commission Manager, Buang Jones. The City of Johannesburg and Premier’s office are expected to take the stand on Tuesday. Watch video below:
