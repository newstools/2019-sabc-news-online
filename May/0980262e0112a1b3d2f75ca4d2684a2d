Thereâ€™s been drama at the troubled Moqhaka municipality in Kroonstad, Free State, after the municipal manager Simon Mqwathi instructed security officers not to allow councillors vehicles to enter the municipal premises. There were attempts on Monday by unknown people to burn the municipality building and the municipal manager is limiting movements inside the premises. According to the councillors the municipal manager suspects they are behind the attempts to burn the municipality to render his administration ungovernable. Municipal spokesperson, Dika Kheswa, says he was not aware of a fallout between Mqwathi and other employees. He says Mqwathi has a good relationship with workers.
