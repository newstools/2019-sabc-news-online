Political activist, Dr Mamphela Ramphele, says gender parity in positions of power is embarrassingly low in South Africa. She was speaking at the memorial lecture of a fellow anti-apartheid activist, Winnie Kgware, at the North West University. “Women in the ANC which has got the largest seats and the largest number of women who are organising but the ANC Woman’s League is his masters voice. Its not about feminism and gender equality. Its about how I mobilise so I become an MP and I become a minister and this and that. “The continent is poorer because it is not utilising the majority people who are women. Women are more than 50% of the population and the idea that after our recent elections only 34 percent of MP’s are women it is a crying shame.” The Kgware family meanwhile feels there hasn’t been enough recognition of anti-apartheid struggle heroes outside of the African National Congress (ANC). “The people who fought hard for where we are today should all be recognised irrespective of which party they come from,” says Winnie’s son Tebogo Kgware. Ramphela also accused the ANC of destroying emerging parties in the country. However, ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe, rejected the claim, and expressed disappointment that a respected person such as Dr Mamphela Ramaphele, could utter such words. Watch video below:
