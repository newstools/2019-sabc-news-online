A man who is alleged to be linked to the torching of two trains over the Easter Weekend is set to make a second appearance in the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Thursday morning. Twelve coaches were set alight at the Cape Town railway station during the incident. The suspect from Khayelitsha, Thobela Xoseni, has requested legal aid. Xoseni has been charged with malicious damage to property. The recent damage to the train coaches amounts to 33 million rand. Arson attacks have resulted in less than half the number of required train sets operating in Cape Town. The latest incident comes on the back of the recent launch of a planned new fleet attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
