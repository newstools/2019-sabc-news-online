The African Transformation Movement (ATM) has denied allegations that the party is linked to former president Jacob Zuma and ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule. This after the general secretary of the South African Council of Messianic Churches in Christ, Vuyisile Ngqulana, linked the pair to the new political party in an affidavit. He alleges that Magashule thought up the name of the party and has directly linked Zuma to the formation of ATM. ATM president, Vuyolwethu Zungula says Ngqulana is spreading lies. “We as the ATM were not formed with the help of the former president or Ace Magashule and are not involved whatsoever in the formation and running of the party. The party was formed by the Council of Messianic Churches and is led by ordinary citizens. Ngqulana is spreading lies. We do not know his intention because he claims he only realised about the existence of the party on 16 April 2019, but there is photo evidence of him wearing ATM regalia and he is on the list of the party going to the national legislature.” Click on the interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/684537">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
