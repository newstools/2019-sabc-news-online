The Minister of Co-operative Governance, Dr Zweli Mkhize, says he is pleased that his department’s intervention has yielded positive results in the embattled Amahlathi Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape. Mkhize conducted an oversight visit to Stutterheim and Keiskammahoek. Both towns were marred by violent service delivery protests last year. A number of municipal buildings were torched during the protests. Residents of the municipality also boycotted the voter registration process. Mkhize says there is a marked improvement in the area. “We have come to re-look at what has happened since our intervention. We are starting to work on the revenue generation and stabilizing the municipality in terms of its governance so the place is settled down.  All the governments from national and local have worked with the municipality to put all of this together. We’ve seen the road has been concluded, the bridges have been concluded…life has actually improved in the area,” says Mkhize.
