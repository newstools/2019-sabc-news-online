The Deputy Secretary of the African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League in North West Bitsa Lenkopane is expected to appear at the Ganyesa magistrate’s court on Monday morning. This is after she allegedly misused the Kagisano Molopo local municipality vehicle during her tenure as the Mayor. Her charge is related to the unauthorised use of a municipal vehicle which was involved in an accident a year ago. The accident led to the death of her domestic worker.  She is also being accused of misusing petrol cards and another vehicle belonging to the municipality. Lenkopane has been sworn in as a member of the legislature despite a criminal record relating to assaulting an Economic Freedom Fighter councillor. Police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone says, “We can confirm that there is a case before Ganyesa magistrate’s court which is a case of use of motor vehicle without the consent of the owner and we can also confirm that the accused in that particular case is Keobiditse Lenkopane.” Watch related video below for more on the story:
