Convicted murderer Lebogang Mofokeng will be sentenced at the Palm Ridge Court on Gauteng’s East rand on Tuesday. Mofokeng was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend Jabulile Nhlapo (23) at a student commune in Vanderbijlpark in May 2018. He told the court that he had stolen his father’s gun and claimed a scuffle with his ex-girlfriend led to the murder. Judge Herman Broodryk who presided over the case described Mofokeng as a self-confessed liar. Broodryk said Mofokeng’s evidence was contradictory and that he did not take any responsibility for his actions. He rejected all of Mofokeng’s version of events on that fateful day saying it was clear he wanted to kill Nhlapo. Nhlapo’s mother, Adeline, says she hopes Mofokeng spends the rest of his life behind bars. WATCH
