Former Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) Themba Godi says he hopes that the incoming members of the committee will follow its legacy report to its logical conclusion. He says this includes the outstanding issues on the irregularities involving Transnet and global retail giant Steinhoff International. Godi will not be returning to Parliament. This comes after his party, the African People’s Convention, failed to obtain enough votes in last week’s elections to get a seat in the National Assembly. He chaired Scopa for 14 years since November 2005. Godi elaborates the outstanding matters which he thinks Scopa should to focus on. “Fortunately for us we have left a legacy report which is a report that summarises the past five years, – things we did, areas of focus and things to prioritise. But also the issues we believe are outstanding like your Steinhoff, your SAA, your Municipalities debt to Eskom. Eskom itself, Transnet, Prasa, Water and Sanitation, Sassa, those are the issues that we have recommended that the new committee should pursue to their logical end.”
