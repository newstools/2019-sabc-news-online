Transnet board Chairperson Popo Molefe says the Gupta family’s influence at Transnet started with the premature pronouncement of Brain Molefe’s appointment in the former Gupta-owned, NewAge newspaper. Molefe says the Gupta family’s influence in Transnet saw the weakening of governance systems and the flouting procurement processes in the company. Molefe says the skills base within the company was also weakened significantly. Molefe is appearing before the State Capture Commission of inquiry currently underway in Parktown Johannesburg.
