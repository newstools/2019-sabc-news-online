Constantia businessman Rob Packham has been convicted for his wife’s murder. Cape Town High Court Judge, Elize Steyn, has also found him guilty of obstructing the administration of justice. Packham was arrested in March, last year, after his wife-Gill’s charred body was found in the boot of her burnt out car near the Diep River railway station. Judge Elize Steyn says, “The evidence points overwhelmingly that the state proved its case beyond reasonable doubt… that he killed his wife and hid her in the boot of her car and set it alight…” Judge Steyn has also described Packham as a crafty deceiver who lived a selfish double life. Her charred remains were found in the boot of her car near this railway station in February last year. Packham maintained his innocence and testified that he had driven around searching for his wife when he was informed she did not arrive at her place of work. He had also admitted to having been involved with another woman, but said he and his wife had been attending marriage counselling. The state argued that Packhmam killed his wife and covered it up to look like a possible hijacking. Gill Packham sustained a blunt force trauma to her head, before her body was burnt in the boot of her car. NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila says, “We are very elated with the outcome. It’s what we worked for all this time, having to work with circumstantial evidence. But we are very convinced that there was no other person who was responsible for the murder of that lady; and we are happy that the court came to that decision that he is the person guilt of the murder.” Packhams two daughters left court without speaking to the media. Gill Packham’s family says they will respond in due course.
