Family members of former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) secretary general, Sindiso Magaqa who was assassinated in 2017 at Umzimkhulu, southern KwaZulu-Natal, are calling for the Magistrate handling the matter to recuse himself from the case. The Umzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court was expected to hand down judgment in the bail application of three men accused of Magaqa’s murder, but the Magistrate could not make it to court because of local protests. It’s the third time the case has been delayed because the Magistrate was not available. Magaqa’s brother, Manqholo says the family feels this matter is not being taken seriously. “We do not have confidence in this Magistrate anymore. When this matter goes to trial, we want another Magistrate to handle this case. This is the third time the matter has been postponed.” Family members of the three accused in this case have also shared the same sentiments against the Magistrate. They say the rights of the accused are being violated. “While we understand that justice must take its course, the accused still have rights too. The Magistrate is not fit for this case; someone else must take over. One day he is sick, the next day it’s another excuse,” says a family member of the accused.
