Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has reiterated that he will never return to the African National Congress (ANC). In April, ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule, revealed the party wants the former ANC Youth League leader back in its fold. Malema was expelled from the governing party in 2012 for bringing it into disrepute and failing to show remorse. The EFF leader says soon after the incident – some of his former comrades went to his grandmother’s house carrying a coffin and told her ‘we are burying your son today’. Malema says after that koko Sarah advised him never to return to the organisation – a promise he plans to keep. The EFF posted his tribute to koko Sarah on twitter on Saturday. Speaking at the 90-year-old’s funeral, Malema described the loss as “like a sharp instrument piercing through his heart.” He hailed koko Sarah as a leader who like the late struggle stalwart, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, proved that women do not need men to provide for their children. Koko Malema died last week Saturday. She raised the EFF leader after his mother passed on. Malema has described her as his confidante, his cool shade and someone who never dismissed the EFF as a mission for younger people.

The vha-Venda King, Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb), Lesetja Kganyago, Rivonia trialist, bab’Andrew Mlangeni and Princess Zenani Mandela-Dlamini also graced the occasion. Malema also paid tribute to ANC National Executive Committee member, Tony Yengeni, whom he described as a loyal servant of the people. The EFF leader says Yengeni has been treated unfairly by the ANC and as they have stood by Madikizela-Mandela – they stand by him.
