Former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss, Johan Booysen is due to continue giving testimony on Friday at the Commission of Inquiry into state capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. On Thursday, Booysen accused the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss, Shaun Abrahams of colluding with others to get rid of him. He says the racketeering charges were part of the plot to silence him. Booysen says law enforcement agencies were being used to cover up high profile cases and anyone who wanted to prosecute would be dealt with. Last week, he dispelled the existence of the so-called Cato Manor death squad in the province as a farce. Booysen told the commission that the death squad was an orchestrated plan to remove him from his position. He also testified about the looting of secret service funds in the province, which implicated former police minister Nathi Mthethwa, and how the NPA interfered in some of the high profile cases.-Additional reporting by Ntlantla Kgatlane.
