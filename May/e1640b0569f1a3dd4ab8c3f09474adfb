EFF leader Julius Malema says he drew courage and inspiration from the words and the actions of his grandmother. Malema was speaking at the funeral of his grandmother Sarah Malema in Seshogo, Limpopo. She died on Monday, aged 90. Several dignitaries attended the funeral service. Strong, loving, courageous and a gallant single mother; that is how Malema described his beloved grandmother. Sarah Malema raised the firebrand EFF leader and his cousins all by herself after
Malema’s mother died some years back, leaving him in the care of his grandmother. He has described his grandmother as a natural born leader. “She fought for that house, won the house, provided for all without a man. And there is nothing special about her because that is what township mothers do.” The former ANC Youth League leader hailed his grandmother for her unwavering support when his political career was hanging by a thread. He says, in honour of Koko Sarah Malema, he will never return to the ANC. “I want to say in front of her coffin, in her presence; that I will never go back to the ANC.” Various dignitaries, business moguls like Patrice Motsepe and Robert Gumede, as well as struggle icon Andrew Mlangeni; were in attendance.
