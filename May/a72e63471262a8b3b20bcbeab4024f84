Police members attached to the Western Cape Organised Crime unit, the dog unit and the Ceres Crime Prevention Unit have arrested five men in Ceres in connection with taxi-related violence that claimed one life. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk says two rival taxi associations were at loggerheads last week after a farm owner made an arrangement with one of the associations to transport his workers from his farm to the Eastern Cape. Van Wyk says a 55-year-old man was shot and killed while another was injured during the dispute. “Five suspects aged between 26 and  39  were arrested  Members seized two licence firearms and confiscated a Navy blue VW Golf 5.  The main motive has been confirmed as taxi violence and these suspects will appear in the Ceres Magistrates Court soon on charges of murder and attempted murder,” says Van Wyk.
