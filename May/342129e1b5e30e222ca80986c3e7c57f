Economist, Dawie Roodt, says state owned enterprises are under financial strain and will need urgent attention soon after the 2019 general election results are announced. Roodt was speaking to SABC News at the elections results centre in Pretoria. With nearly 60-percent of results already counted, South Africa is preparing to hear the final results of the country’s sixth democratic elections. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) says it expects 90% of the vote to be declared by 10pm on Thursday. The African National Congress (ANC) is in the lead nationally, with around 56 per cent of the vote. It’s followed by the Democratic Alliance (DA) with over 22%  and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with more than 9%. Roodt says Eskom and the country’s bloated public service are issues the new government will have to prioritise. “I think this land thing and the nationalisation of the Reserve Bank is probably not going to die down, but is probably going to be moved to the back burner for now – because there are far more important and pressing issues. Eskom for example is a massive issue. The civil service generally speaking – there are just too many civil servants who are hopelessly overpaid in SA. We need to get the quality of service improved. We have to sort out SAA and that sort of stuff. That is far far more important than trying to nationalise the SARB, as an example. So my suspicion is those are the sort of things the President is going to focus on.” He says international investors will be watching for policy changes and the make-up of the new cabinet.
