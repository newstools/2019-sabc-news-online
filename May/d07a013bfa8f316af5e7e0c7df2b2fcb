Former Public Protector, advocate Thuli Madonsela has refuted claims that she might be part of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new cabinet. She says there is more to do outside government that would also help grow South Africa. Madonsela says she’s going to partner with civil society groups and push the agenda of closing the gap between the rich and the poor. “At this stage I have a very important role to play. I haven’t chosen it because I have nothing else to do, I’ve had opportunities.” “The main challenge we have in South Africa today and the world is poverty and inequality and it can’t only be tackled from government.” “We need to mobilize society; we also need to mobilize civil society groups, intellectual and otherwise so as to help governments to do better.” Watch President Cyril Ramaphosa’s inauguration below:
