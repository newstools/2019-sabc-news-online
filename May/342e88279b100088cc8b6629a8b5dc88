International NGO WaterAid is calling on governments to design female-friendly toilets that cater for the needs of women when they are menstruating. They propose that government design toilets that are safe, easily accessible and have facilities to support menstrual hygiene. They want toilets that will provide water and soap for washing, reusable sanitary pads and a place to dispose of sanitary products. The call comes as the world marks Menstual Hygiene Day on Tuesday. The day is used to break the silence and raise awareness as well as to change negative social norms around menstrual hygiene management for women and girls globally. Robert Kampala, Regional Director for WaterAid Southern Africa, says we need to appreciate the role of access to clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene, but more needs to be done. “We would like to see governments and key players in the water and sanitation sector to ensure that there is a greater engagement of women and girls in the planning and designing of female friendly toilets and we would like to see a higher number of public facilities really designed as female friendly toilets.” Meanwhile, to mark this day, the Sex Rights Africa Network has an exciting programme of campaigns and activities linked to #HappyFlow. This as all over the African continent, people miss school and work when they have a period because they don’t have access to sanitary wear. They risk infection from using newspaper, leaves, rags and other materials.
