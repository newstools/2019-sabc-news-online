 The swearing-in process of members of provincial legislature  (MPLs) gets underway on Tuesday across the country following the general elections. In the Eastern Cape, the legislature says it’s ready for the swearing in ceremony of 63 new members on Tuesday. The African National Congress (ANC) will occupy 44 seats, the Democratic Alliance (DA) 10, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) five and United Democratic Movement (UDM) two. The African Transformation Movement (ATM) and FF Plus will each occupy one seat in the legislature. Outgoing deputy speaker, Mlibo Qoboshiyane says they’ve met the new members and are looking forward to their participation in the legislature. “All systems are now ready to embrace and receive new members that will be sworn- in and I can say we’re happy with the candidate lists that are here. It’s a mix of young and old, women and so forth and they were introduced to various rules of the house on how to do certain things.” The Limpopo legislature will see 49 members being sworn-in on Tuesday at the first sitting of the sixth Legislature at Lebowakgomo outside Polokwane. Legislature spokesperson, Meodi Mothapo says members will be sworn-in according to the lists provided by the four parties represented at the legislature. “As a legislature once a party endorses or sends us a list of its own representatives we respect it as such if there’s any discrepancies that maybe yourself as the media or any other person has got issues with that should be taken up with the party concerned. The ANC has got 38 members followed by EFF with seven members the DA with three and FF Plus with one. We will welcome their members as they are presented to us.”
