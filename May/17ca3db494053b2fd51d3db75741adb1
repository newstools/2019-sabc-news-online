Police Minister Bheki Cele has warned ministers and MECs to refrain from exploiting police officers by assigning or forcing them to do duties that are not in their job descriptions. He was speaking at the memorial service of two Durban Metro police officers who were shot dead on Tuesday while  guarding the home of a ward councillor in Bhambayi north of Durban. Cele says it is disappointing to find some police officers pushing trolleys of groceries for ministers. “Others don’t fall under but those who look after ministers fall under and I am running 193 000 police officers. I always tell ministers not to order our police to push trolleys when they do groceries. We find police officers pushing trolleys and ministers become Madam and Sirs. Their job is look after your life not to be your comfort or girls and boys who are picking things for you. No, respect these officers,” says Cele.
