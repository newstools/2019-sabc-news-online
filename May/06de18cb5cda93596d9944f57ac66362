Lectures at the Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley have ground to a halt. Students protested on campus about the quality of food in the cafeteria. Teaching and learning at Sol Plaatje University was disrupted. Students are demanding the immediate removal of the university caterer. They claim that the food being served at the campus cafeteria is rotten. “The university doesn’t want to take the students seriously, the only language they understand is violence. We’ve been talking to them since from Monday. Students have been having running stomach for about four to five days,” says Thabo Moilwa who is the SRC president. “We want number  for us to continue to have food that is not going to make our stomach run. We cannot go to class when you’re having a running stomach. We want management to take us seriously by insourcing those mamma’s who have been there since 2014 cooking for us,” says Kim Maruping who is a Student at the university. The university has been in negotiations with the disgruntled students over their concerns. “What we have to do is keep students fed and so the difficulty of providing the meals while we keep the classes going, is actually the issue, the issue we’re dealing with at the moment. Students have suspended classes and have prevented other students from going to class. They’ve also prevented staff from going to campus,” explains Yunnus Ballim, who is the Sol Plaatje University vice chancellor. The university management is hopeful that they’ll reach an agreement with students to resume classes on Friday.
