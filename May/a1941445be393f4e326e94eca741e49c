Police and Correctional Services officials are on the hunt for three offenders who escaped from the Middledrift Correctional Centre in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday night. Sizwe Mhlana, Andisa Vas and Aviwe Nkwalase were serving between 10 and 18 years prison terms for robbery and attempted murder. Correctional Services Spokesperson Nobuntu Gantana says an internal investigation is underway. “The department wishes to caution the public not to try to apprehend the escapees as they are dangerous criminals. Members of the public are urged to report any information they have that might lead to the re-arrest of these inmates to the nearest police.”
