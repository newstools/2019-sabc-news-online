Lawyers representing talk show host Karima Brown have requested that the Gauteng High Court send out a strong message that the intimidation of journalists is a serious breach in the Electoral Code of Ethics. Brown hauled the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  to court on Monday after receiving death and rape threats – following EFF leader, Julius Malema’s decision to post her mobile number on his Twitter account. Brown has lodged a complaint against the party with the  Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) and wants the court to rule that the EFF contravened parts of the Electoral Act. She also wants Malema to be handed a formal warning, a fine of R 100 000 and for him to issue public apology. Watch related video below:
