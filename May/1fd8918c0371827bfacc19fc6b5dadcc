Former Black Business Council President Danisa Baloyi and her three co-accused have been released on R5 000 bail each for alleged R5 million fraud. Baloyi, Dominic Ntsele and siblings Bibi Hawa and Abubaker Ebrahim Khan appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Gauteng’s Eastrand on Thursday morning. The accused handed themselves in at the Serious Commercial Crimes offices in Johannesburg on Wednesday where they were charged and subsequently appeared in court. According to the Hawks, Baloyi approached the Airports Company South Africa in 2017 for a fundraising donation of R5-million. She allegedly submitted the name of a company and its banking details which allegedly was nominated to run the fundraising event. The Hawks say the funds were transferred into Merit Energy PTY Limited owned by her siblings. Hawks investigations also revealed that the funds were later transferred into another business account, Incentive Driven Marketing, allegedly owned by Ntsele, which was allegedly used for the fundraising it was not intended for. The case has postponed to next week Monday.
