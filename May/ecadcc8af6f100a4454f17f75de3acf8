Eastern Cape premier candidate, Oscar Mabuyane, has pledged to provide clean and transparent governance. The African National Congress (ANC) provincial leadership put forward his name for the position of premier and the National Executive Committee endorsed it. Mabuyane says his government will be free from wasteful expenditure. He has also promised to grow the economy of the province and drive job creation. “To talk about decent life we need to create jobs for our people. We are going to look at our low hanging fruit in this province. You must talk about agriculture. We must talk about Oceans economy, huge opportunities for tourism and sport tourism, so we are going to work on that to diversify the economy,” says Mabuyane. Mabuyane is taking over a divided province after the chaotic 2017 provincial elective conference. Political analyst Dr Luvuyo Dondolo says one of Mabuyane’s tasks is to unite the party. “I think one advice is to work with all factions and he must exclude those from other groups. He must find a way of balancing that by doing that. He will dis-empower those who want to work against him,” says Dondolo.
