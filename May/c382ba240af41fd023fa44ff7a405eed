The Kruger National Park held an award ceremony for its staff members to honour them for excellent work and bravery at the 20th awards presentation ceremony in Skukuza, Mpumalanga. Those who are productive and have good attitude towards their work were also awarded. In the Bravery Category, two staff members were honoured for single-handedly dealing with a situation in which a geyser fell on his colleagues in one of the building. Another employee Thomas Chauke was honoured post-posthumously for saving some of his colleagues during a leopard attack. His wife Busani Chauke and relatives accepted the award on his behalf. The work which the staff members carry includes programmes to combat elephant and rhino poaching. The Kruger National Park also boasts over one million tourists who visit the area annually. Acting Management Executive, Danie Pienaar, says there are approximately 2000 staff members working at the Park. “Without the people, this place cannot exist. The Kruger Park relies on passionate and dedicated people to keep it in business,” says Pienaar. He says there are those individuals who always go the extra mile in their work.
