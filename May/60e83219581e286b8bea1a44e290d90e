Transnet has interdicted an expected shutdown by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu). The union was due to down tools from Thursday afternoon over a wage dispute with Transnet National Ports Authority.  SATAWU alleges a salary discrepancy between black and white mariners with white mariners being paid more even with less experience. Negotiations have collapsed, threatening a total shutdown of all eight ports along the country’s coastline. Union spokesperson Zanele Sabela says, “Transnet has interdicted the strike yesterday (Wednesday). We had to urgently attend to court and what happened was the judge reserved the ruling until the 5th of September, so that effectively means the shutdown cannot go ahead today (Thursday).”
