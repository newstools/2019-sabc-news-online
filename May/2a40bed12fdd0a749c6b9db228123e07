Newly sworn-in North West premier, Job Mokgoro has talked hard on corruption, saying those who still have corruption allegations hanging over their heads won’t make it to his provincial cabinet. Mokgoro, whose province was taken over by the national government, says his priority would be to appoint the right people – both in the executive and administration. “We are fully behind efforts to root out corruption. All of us have this opportunity to serve in the provincial state of North West. Those who serve have better make sure – I am talking about both political and administrative, better make sure that they are the right people, in the right seat, in the right bus and the right direction. “Let me send a warning bell to those who will be serving in the executive, we are the servants of the people. We will do nothing apart from responding to the dire needs of the people,” he stresses. Mokgoro’s appointment as premier has been welcomed by the alliance partners of the African National Congress (ANC) as well as the women’s league in the North West. Mokgoro was appointed as North West Premier in June 2018, taking over from then premier, Supra Mahumapelo. Related story:  North West places seven municipalities under administration
