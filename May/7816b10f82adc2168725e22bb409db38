South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) management says the diesel spillage at the SABC Radio Park building is under control and that employees working in areas affected will be able to resume duties on Monday. Around 1000 staff members working in the building were told to go home on Wednesday. The public broadcaster’s internal systems had switched from City Power to its back-up generator following a power outage. The equipment then failed, leading to the diesel tank overflowing and causing a large spillage. SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu says:”The mopping and cleaning up operation continues by the specialized service providers. And at this stage the status core remains that employees are expected to be back at work on Monday.” Watch related videos click below:
