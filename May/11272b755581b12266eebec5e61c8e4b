Leader of the Freedom Front Plus (FF plus), Pieter Groenewald has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to use the responsibility given to him by the people to work towards uniting the country and ensuring equal rights for all, including minority groups. Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, Groenewald called on the President to heed the call of the nation, even when it may differ from the views of the African National Congress (ANC). “Honourable President, there’s a huge responsibility on your shoulders. The people of South Africa want hope, they want hope for the future that’s what we need in South Africa. Part of that responsibility is that you are now also the President of the people, all the people and therefore you must ensure that the interest of the people of South Africa is more important than the interest of your political party, the ANC. You have to ensure and enhance nation-building in SA,” says Groenewald.
