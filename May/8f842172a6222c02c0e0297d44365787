The Commercial, Stevedoring, Agricultural and Allied Workers union (Csaawu) members have embarked on a protected strike at the Oak Valley Farm in Elgin Valley, Western Cape. The move follows a breakdown in wage talks, among other issues. The farm produces grapes, apple, pears and commercial cut flowers. The workers are picketing outside its head office in Grabouw. Csaawu National Organising Secretary, Karel Swart, says the union wants seasonal workers to be paid R250 per day instead of the minimum R18 daily wage. He says all seasonal workers must be given permanent employment. “The second thing that workers put on the table is the compounds (hostels). The union demands that we must convert these compounds into family units. Our black people have nowhere to go. Upgrade these compounds and convert the compounds into family units. That is a case of human rights demands.”
