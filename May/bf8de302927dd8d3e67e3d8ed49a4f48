Efforts to find a solution to the standoff over Gauteng’s online school registration for 2020 continue. On Monday, the process was postponed to May 20, 2019, after some lobby groups expressed unhappiness about various aspects of the system. The Federation of Associations of Governing Bodies of South Africa (Fedsas) and the Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysunie (SAOU) are among those concerned. Among the others issues, they are worried that although the system gives parents five school options within the radius of their addresses, it doesn’t take into account the language of teaching and learning. Manager for Fedsa’s Technology Centre, Riaan van der Bergh, says they have been meeting with government in a bid to find a resolution to the matter. “We approached the department about a week or so ago in connection with the problems that were showing on the system when we tested the system.” CEO of SAOU, Chris Klopper, adds: “Our major concern was the fact that the regulations, the online system and the feeder zones were not reconcilable with each other.” Childhood Education lecturer at the University of Johannesburg, Ntsiki Msimango, agrees with Klopper and Van der Bergh.
