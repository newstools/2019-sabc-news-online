Former President, Jacob Zuma says those who want his fraud and corruption case to go to trial will regret it just like those who called for the inquiry into State Capture. Zuma was speaking outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court, in KwaZulu-Natal, after the court reserved judgement on his application for permanent stay of prosecution. The former president says when the State Capture commission was announced and got underway many thought that he would be implicated, but this has not happened. Zuma, who is charged along with the French arms company Thales, faces 16 counts of corruption, fraud and racketeering. He maintains he is innocent. On Thursday, his legal representative – Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane claimed that his client does not have the funds to finance his corruption trial and accused the State of trying to squeeze the former president dry through litigation costs.
