The Johannesburg Metro Police Department has issued a stark warning to potential criminals, as new undercover officers begin to proactively monitor the streets of the inner city. The JMPD has launched its undercover unit aimed at tackling crime and corruption, with 80 JMPD officers being deployed to solely deal with illegal activities picked up by cameras. Johannesburg Public Safety Member of Mayoral Committee, Michael Sun, says undercover officers are expected to deal with criminals within three minutes of a crime being picked up on CCTV cameras. “They will go in civilian clothes and unmarked vehicles. They are being deployed to hotspots that we have identified in Yeoville, Hillbrow, Doornfontein, Braamfontein and other parts of the inner city to ensure that street crimes such as mugging, smash and grabs and grabbing of cell phones from motorists , hijackings are being dealt with within three minutes as we pick them up from the CCTV screens.” He adds: “This is a very strong message to criminals to say that this is not another project that we are just merely telling you about; there are actual police officers on the ground.” Click on the related videos below:
