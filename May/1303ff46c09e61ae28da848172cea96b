Legal expert Advocate Makhosazana Mbonani says the Pietermaritzburg High Court will decide if there is any prejudice that has been suffered by former President Jacob Zuma. Zuma is facing 16 charges including fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering. The charges are in connection with the controversial multi billion rand arms deal. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Advocate, Andrew Breitenbach, conceded that Zuma, his financial advisor Schabir Shaik and French arms company Thales should have been tried together on corruption charges. Breitenbach was responding to arguments by the Thales legal team who are applying for a permanent stay of prosecution. Mbonani says the court needs to determine if Zuma can still be tried fairly. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/691818">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
