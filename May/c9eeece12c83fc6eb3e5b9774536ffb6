The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it is simply fighting for what is right when it defends the Public Protectors Office. The party’s deputy president Floyd Shivambu says they believe that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s report on Pravin Gordhan‘s actions in the Ivan Pillay early retirement matter is correct and the EFF will not allow her to be labelled as biased. Shivambu says they agree with Mkwhebane that there was clear maladministration on Gordhan’s part. He says they do not agree with the DA’s call to remove Mkwhebane from office. “One thing which is the most dynamic with the EFF is that when you do right we will tell you that you are right. When you do wrong, we will tell you that you’re wrong. We are not fanatics of anyone. So, when we made an observation about the Public Protector and there’s market improvements in terms of her judgements and observations, we carry an observation, all us as South Africans to protect and defend the office of the Public Protector on the basis of her findings.” Click below for more on the story:
