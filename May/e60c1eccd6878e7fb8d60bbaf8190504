The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the return of some MECs back in office will not bring any change in Limpopo. DA leader Jacques Smalle says MECs like Dickson Masemola should not have returned, due to a bad record. “The premier didn’t hold people accountable in the 5th parliament. I don’t see him holding people accountable now and some dodgy characters that made their return. You will know that Dickson Masemola was the key MEC when the province was placed under administration in 2011. When he was responsible for over R2 billion which led to the fall of the province,” says Masemola. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has expressed concern over the return of Stan Mathabatha as the premier of Limpopo. Provincial chairperson Jossey Buthane says the appointment of new MECs will not make any difference under the same leadership. “You still have a premier known for sleeping on duty even the new one will sleep on duty and we are going to have an issue of accountability, what these people needed was a leader and this government was on auto pilot. Now this guy is going to sleep on duty,” says Buthane.
