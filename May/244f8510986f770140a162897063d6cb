Eleven scholars were injured in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg on Monday morning after the vehicle they were travelling in veered off the road and rolled on its roof. Details surrounding the incident are still unclear at this stage. Emer-G-Med Spokesperson, Jurgen Kotze, says: “A Toyota Avanza sustained an event that caused it to roll over. The reason for that is unclear and obviously a full investigation will follow. We treated 11 scholars. There are some questions with over-loading.”
