The Equality Court sitting in Cape Town has postponed the case against DA member of parliament Dianne Kohler Barnard for next month. Former DA staff member Louw Nel lodged a case against Kohler Barnard whom he alleged to have made racist and xenophobic remarks at a staff workshop last year. In her replying affidavit against the allegation, Kohler Barnard denied that her remarks constituted unfair discrimination. The court said it will hear oral evidence next month to determine whether the allegations by Nel indeed offends the provisions of the law against racism, xenophobic and discrimination. In 2015, Kohler Barnard successfully appealed her expulsion from the DA after she was found guilty for bringing the name of the party into disrepute and for contravening its social media policy. She shared a Facebook post calling for the return of former Apartheid state president PW Botha.
