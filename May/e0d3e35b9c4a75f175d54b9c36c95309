A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) known as Hannah’s Arms in Port Elizabeth has developed a baby safe drop off box. Mothers can safely give up their babies instead of discarding them in plastic bags and drains.The box has been built into a wall at a safe house in Mkhuze Street in Zwide. “We understand that there are circumstances where the mother just actually cannot do this and her better choice for the baby  would be to place the baby in the baby safe where we can actually save this baby’s life rather than having them die in the elements because nobody gets them in time,” says Esmé Chesworth, Founder of Hannah’s Arms. A local resident, Pumeza Batana, says they’re happy as the box will help people including teenagers who have unplanned babies . “It’s really going to help, not for those who really don’t want their children but for those who are being raped and forced to take care of a rape child. You already have the trauma of being raped and now you have to sit with the trauma. Not that you hate the child but you have something that’s going to remind you consistently of where you come from and how you actually went about through that,” says Batana.
