Freedom Front Plus (FF-Plus) leader Pieter Groenewald has rejected allegations of nepotism in the party. His son and the wife of the party’s National Head of Elections and Strategy, Wouter Wessels were selected to become MPs. The FF-Plus leader’s son Michael and Wessels’ wife Tamarin are among the ten FF-Plus designated members who will be sworn in during the first sitting of the National Assembly on Wednesday. Both Groenewald senior and Wouter Wessels will also return to Parliament. Groenewald says the two young MPs have been chosen on merit. “I think it is unfair to say it is nepotism. I think people must understand that the Freedom Front Plus only has one criteria for people who go to go to Parliament or all their public office bearers, and that is merit.  I can assure the people, that those members are going to Parliament on merit and I think it is unfair just because someone has earned a position on merit and because there is a family tie, now the person is not allowed to do that,” says Groenewald.
