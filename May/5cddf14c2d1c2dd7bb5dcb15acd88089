The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and the Office of the Public Protector will on Friday morning visit Alexandra township north of Johannesburg following last month’s protests. Residents were disgruntled over the mushrooming of illegal dwellings and poor service delivery. The Commission will investigate possible basic human rights violations while the Office of the Public Protector will probe alleged corruption and maladministration relating to the Alexandra Urban Renewal Project. President Cyril Ramaphosa has since established an Inter-Ministerial task team to respond to issues raised by Alexandra residents. “The commission will meet and interview residents of Alex to get an account of their lived experience. And also meet with the convenors of the Alex Shut down.  The commission is probing the causes behind the protest.  The Public Protector will confine its investigation in corruption, impropriety, the manner in which funds were used during the Alexandra Renewal Project” says Buang Jones, SAHRC.
