The bodies of eight miners have been recovered in a mine north of Harare in Zimbabwe, following an explosion in a mine shaft. The incident occurred at a previously abandoned mine in the countryâ€™s Mazowe region north of the capital. Illegal mining is a common problem in mineral-rich Zimbabwe. In February, more than 20 miners died after an open mine flooded overnight.
