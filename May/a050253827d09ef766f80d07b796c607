Former African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape leader, Marius Fransman, is expected to appear in the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court on charges of sexual assault. Fransman allegedly sexually assaulted his former Personal Assistant, Louisa Wynand, in 2016 while they were on their way to the ANC’s January 8 birthday celebrations in North West. Fransman was subsequently suspended from the party for five years.
