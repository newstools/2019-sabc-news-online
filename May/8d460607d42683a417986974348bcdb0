City of Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa’s days in the office seem to be numbered.  This is after the Democratic Alliance (DA) confirmed that power sharing talks with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are in motion. However, for Tshwane residents their concerns are service delivery and not fragile political alliances. Soon after taking over from former mayor Solly Msimanga, Mokgalapa ran an elaborate campaign introducing himself as the new face of the capital city. However, just three months into his job, the EFF is leading calls for Mokgalapa’s exit to make way for the red berets candidate. For residents however, all they want is improved service delivery. “We have a challenge of water. We were promised that water will be installed quite soon but it’s been taking far too long. At the moment we are getting water delivered through Jojo tanks.” Another resident says; “Any mayor who is coming in must address this challenge of those empty buildings which are just standing without people, and on the issue of service delivery, sometimes you find that you report an electrical fault, these guys can spend two to three days without coming to address the problem.” Initially Mokgalapa denied that there were talks to axe him but the DA has since confirmed power sharing talks with EFF in Tshwane have begun. Mokgalapa initially agreed to speak to SABC News about his future as Tshwane Mayor but made a last minute about-turn stating that power sharing talks with the EFF are handled nationally. Interestingly Mokgalapa remains on the DA’s parliamentary list at number 79, an indication that he may still exit the mayoral seat and head back to Parliament. Click below for more on the story:
