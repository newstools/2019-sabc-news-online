KwaZulu-Natal’s new official opposition party, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), has added its voice to calls for the suspension of eThekwini Municipal Mayor, Zandile Gumede. Gumede and two other suspects, councillor Mondli Mthembu and service provider Craig Ponnan have been implicated in a Durban Solid Waste tender. They have been charged with fraud, corruption, money laundering as well as contravening the Municipal Management Act of 2003. The suspects appeared in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday and were granted bail of R50 000 each. IFP spokesperson in the eThekwini municipality, Mdu Nkosi, says Gumede should be suspended to protect the whistleblowers. “We are surprised that this matter appears just a few days after the elections. Now we suspect that there was political interference to ensure that it must be delayed so that the ANC cannot be tarnished in front of the voters of eThekwini. The Mayor must be suspended,” says Nkosi. Watch a related videos below:
