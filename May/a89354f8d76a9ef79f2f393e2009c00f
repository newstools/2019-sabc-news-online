Disaster relief organisation, the Gift of the Givers, has withdrawn from Makhanda in the Eastern Cape after assisting the drought-stricken city with water sourcing. In a statement, the organisation says it had advised the Makana Municipality that the cost to solve the water crisis would be around R23 million while their work had already come up to R15 million. Gift of the Givers’ Imtiaz Sooliman says they were informed by the Water and Sanitation Department last month that they were no longer needed and Makhanda companies would be paid for drought relief intervention. He alleges this would be R10 million for work they have already done. Sooliman says this includes the drilling of 15 boreholes and testing of water.  Click below for more on the story:
