Tributes continue to pour in for the late Labour Court Judge, Anton Steenkamp. He died after being bitten by a black mamba, while holidaying with his wife in Zambia. Steenkamp’s close friend, Charles Leonard, says his sudden passing has left friends and family reeling in shock. Leonard has described Judge Steenkamp as a man with exceptional intellect, who was committed to human rights. Cape Town Labour Court Judge President, Basheer Wagley, says the labour fraternity is also struggling to come to terms with Steenkamp’s passing. “The legal fraternity is very small everyone know everybody, and everyone is in a state of shock. I have been getting calls all night from people, labour lawyers and labour organisations who are extremely sad, including academics and practicing attorneys and advocates.” Author and columnist Max Du Preez has hailed Steenkamp as a man of integrity, who was committed to justice and democracy. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/690452">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> The South African Society for Labour Law (Saslaw) has also expressed sadness at the news. It says Judge Steenkamp was on a long leave at the time of his passing. “Judge Steenkamp will be fondly remembered as an excellent judge and labour lawyer who contributed significantly to the development of our labour law jurisprudence. He also served as the National President of Saslaw.”
