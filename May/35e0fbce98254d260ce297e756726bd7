The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will be back again on Monday in the Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg to continue its probe into the violent protests that erupted in the run-up to the general elections. This is the Commission’s second sitting of the inquiry established to look into the possible violation of basic human rights, allegations of maladministration and improper conduct concerning the Alexandra Renewal Project. Alexandra residents embarked on total shutdown of the township last month in protest over poor service delivery and the mushrooming of illegal dwellings. “The investigation seeks to establish the causes behind the protests.  The enquiry will further report and make recommendations concerning whether there are violations of the rights contained in the Bill of Rights. The enquiry will also look into how the three spheres of government dealt with grievances related to the provisions of services in Alexandra,” says SAHRC’s Buang Jones. Watch a related video below:
