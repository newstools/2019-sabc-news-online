 President Cyril Ramaphosa says a more capable and configured cabinet will be announced soon. He says  the structure of his new cabinet will align to government key priorities to grow the economy and create jobs. The President was addressing the Goldman Sachs Investor Conference in Johannesburg Wednesday morning. “The key problem that we face as a country is low economic growth. The structure that we have of government is going to speak to that and the coordination will also be seeking to address that.  We will be seeking to get men and women who have great competence, great capabilities to serve the needs of the people of SA. I don’t want to hear any excuses from anyone.” Meanwhile, Ramaphosa has told investors not to be deterred from seeking investment opportunities in the country – amid the land reform debate in South Africa.
