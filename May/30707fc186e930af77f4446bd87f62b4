Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she conducts her work without fear, favour or prejudice. Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office has come under scrutiny by a number of political parties and organisations, with some calling for her to be removed. This follows her release of a damning report which found that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordan had violated the Constitution when he approved the early pension payout for former SARS official Ivan Pillay. Speaking to the SABC News, Mkhwebane defended the timing of the report’s release. “Why must I stop doing my work because there’s an event happening in SA? I’m a constitutional institution, I do my work without fear, favour or prejudice, therefore whether it has political implication, I’m a public protector who is apolitical. Everyone is equal before the law.” The Public Protector says her report on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is aimed at achieving fiscal stability. Mkhwebane then instructed President Cyril Ramaphosa to take disciplinary action against Gordhan. “South Africans need to know that the report is trying to remedy the potential risk to the fiscal of the country. We are here to make sure that we say to administration – you need to make sure that such things are not taking place.” Gordhan has hit back at the report and will be taking the report on review.  Media perceptions Meanwhile, Mkhwebane has accused some court judges of being populist and basing their judgement on media perceptions instead on facts. “We don’t need to have celebrity or populist judges who will then take what ever is said on the media about an individual and use that test to decide on their cases. Some of the interviews I do, you find that the very same people who are taking me to court they even include whatever we are discussing in their affidavits. Some judges entertain those issues instead of just purely focusing on the facts and the law.”
