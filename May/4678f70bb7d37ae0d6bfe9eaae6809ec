Former workers of Lily Mine in Barberton, Mpumalanga, are threatening to go underground to retrieve a container in which three people were trapped and killed after it collapsed when the mine caved in three years ago. The angry workers have been camping at the mine for about ten days now. Their aim is to get the attention of mine management and government. “No response we are getting from the government as a whole. So we have resorted that the waiting is enough now, because it’s over three years. We’ve been waiting and nothing  is happening. So we took this resolution as a collective resolution. As I said we want to go down and do something aiming to retrieve the container ourselves because nobody is helping us up to this far,” says one of the former workers, Herry Mazibuko.
