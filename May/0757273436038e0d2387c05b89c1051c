The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal appears to be divided on how the Mayor of Ethekwini Zandile Gumede should be dealt with. The ANC Youth League in the eThekwini region is calling for her resignation. However, the party in the province has issued a statement calling for the law to take its course. Gumede and two others, councillor Mondli Mthembu and service provider Craig Ponnan, appeared in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday facing charges of fraud, racketeering and corruption over a R208 million on Durban Solid Waste tender. They were granted bail of R50 000 each. The league’s regional spokesperson, Thulisa Ndlela says, “Without expressing a view on the guilt or the innocence of them we believe that given the seriousness of the charges it is important that the Mayor speaks to her conscience and resigns to achieve two things – first and foremost giving her an opportunity to focus on the charges and mounting a defence, and responding to the charges against her. Number two, in order to protect the dignity and the good name of the African National Congress, it is important for the Mayor to resign to ensure that the ANC is not punished by these allegations.
