Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, says it was not unusual to witness African National Congress (ANC) members stage a walk out during his State of the City Address (SOCA) in Braamfontein on Tuesday. With less than a week to go before the May the 8th elections, Mashaba on Tuesday outlined planned programmes for the city and emphasised the importance of service delivery. His announcement that a multi-party government has brought about change to residents, prompted ANC members to disrupt proceedings and leave. Mashaba says his speech was not meant for electioneering but rather to highlight what has been done in the city so far. “Those that decided to walk out of council have demonstrated that is what they do every time, delay and disrupt proceedings. My entire address is there for the public to see. Does it really mean when I talk about corruption of the precious administration, am I lying? Am I lying when I say ever since this multi-party government took over, juts in 2.5 years we have issued over 6000 title deeds? We’ve now attracted R20 billion of construction opportunities where 11000 people are going to get job opportunities,” says Mashaba. Watch a related video below:
