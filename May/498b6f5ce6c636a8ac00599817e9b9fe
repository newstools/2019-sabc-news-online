Outgoing Gauteng Human Settlements MEC, Uhuru Moiloa, says until land issues are resolved, it’s going to be difficult to resolve service delivery issues facing Alexandra. He told an inquiry probing issues impacting on fundamental human rights in the embattled township, north of Johannesburg. The unprecedented joint inquiry by two Chapter 9 institutions – the SA Human Rights Commission and Public Protector – is also probing if the unabated service delivery issues could be linked to maladministration and abuse of power. Officials from Human Settlements and City of Johannesburg are facing questions on allegations of corruption and improper conduct in the multi-million rand Alex Renewal Project. Deputy Director-General of the National Human Settlements, Neville Chainee, says officials must admit that there were moments of failures due to mismanagement in the project. “It was R1.3 billion announced by President Thabo Mbeki for the Alex Renewal Project. It was adopted by three spheres of government and each had to contribute … In 2015, a performance audit was commissioned and conducted by the office of the AG. There were no nice things about management.” Meanwhile, Moiloa says lawlessness has severely impacted on the development in the area. “Until we have resolved the land issues, we’re not going to be able to improve Alexandra. For Alexandra to develop; there has to be order and law, general agreement in terms of how it needs to be improved. There’s state of complete lawlessness and anarchy that’s happening in Alexandra, this include illegal occupation of land.” The inquiry continues. WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
