More than 1 000 prisoners in the Kroonstad prison have gathered in a hall to watch the inauguration ceremony of President-elect Cyril Ramaphosa. The GCIS has organised big screens for the inmates to view the ceremony happening at Loftus Versfeld stadium, in Pretoria. Prisoners at Kroonstad, Zastron and Henneman Prisons in the Free State will be able to follow the proceedings. Inmates at these prisons will be able to view the whole ceremony on big screens set up in prisons. GCIS content and provincial liaison Lehlohonolo Manoto, says the GCIS took the decision to encourage social cohesion in prisons as it is their mandate to communicate government affairs to the public in general.
