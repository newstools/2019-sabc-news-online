An eyewitness, who testified in the culpable homicide trial of Duduzane Zuma, has backed up Zuma’s testimony, telling the Randburg Magistrate’s Court that the former President’s son was not speeding on the night of the fatal crash. Duduzane Zuma is facing one count of culpable homicide and another of reckless and negligent driving. His Porsche crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 in January 2014, resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube. In his testimony, eyewitness Michael Jankelowitz told the court that he noticed Zuma’s Porsche passing him on the M1 highway, as he is a fan of sports cars. He said due to the inclement weather conditions on the night when the incident occurred, he was traveling at 60 kilometres an hour, when Zuma passed him at an average speed. The prosecution then asked him why he did not testify during the inquest and why did he approach Zuma’s defence team now, instead of the state. Jankelowitz then told the court that he approached Zuma’s defence because he believed that Gerrie Nel was the prosecutor in the case and he felt that Zuma would have received an unfair trial. The trial has been postponed to 20 June for closing argument.
