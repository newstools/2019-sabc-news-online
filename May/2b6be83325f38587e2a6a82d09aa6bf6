Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says they welcome the marginal increase in the number of women to represent political parties in the National Assembly. The Electoral Commission of South Africa says the figure has risen by at least 3% compared to the fifth parliament. It says 45% of the names on the parliamentary lists it received from political parties are those of women. Mothapo says this will improve South Africa’s world ranking in terms of women representation in parliament. “The parties themselves who contest the elections determine who should become a member of parliament in terms of the law as long as they qualify in terms of the Constitution. Those members will qualify to be sworn in as members of Parliament, but I think we need to appreciate that there is a 3% or so improvement.”
