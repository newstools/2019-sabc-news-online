Supporters of the Pro-Makhado Task Team are celebrating following the release of their deputy chairperson Arnold Mulaudzi. He was arrested on Tuesday and charged with contravening the Electoral Act. Mulaudzi was released on R 5000 bail. “I am happy that the deputy chairperson Arnold Mulaudzi has been released. Everybody is happy even at home they have started celebrating. We still need our municipality; we won’t go to LIM 345. We need Makhado back to us,” enchanted one of the supporters. The case was postponed to the 3rd of June for further investigations. Task Team’s chairperson, Takalani Mukhudi says they welcome the court’s decision. “We feel that the hand of government is a bit stiff. We never thought it will go so much higher. We felt like usual bails for this nature will range from R1000 to R1500. But we are governed by the rule of law in South Africa, it’s a court of law that can dictate any thing.” Meanwhile, the boycott of government services and businesses in Vuwani and surrounding areas in Limpopo has been called off. The shutdown started on Tuesday over a municipal demarcation dispute. Mukhudi says they are calling off the boycott because their leader who was arrested on Tuesday, has been released.
