Preparations for the presidential inauguration have officially started. The Loftus stadium management has handed over the stadium to the government for the event. The ministerial committee tasked with organising the inauguration say the change of venue is a cost-cutting measure. The ministerial committee say the price tag will be R100 million less than the previous inauguration. The countdown to the inauguration has officially started. The preparations are expected to be completed before the set date.  With Loftus stadium now in the hands of government, organisers have seven days before next week’s ceremony. Minister in the presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says: “We still have to do a lot of work between now and then to configure it in a way that we would like the inauguration to be. So it is important that the stadium be handed over to government so that we can start working.” The hosting of the inauguration at stadium is a first for the country and a first experience for the stadium management. They say this is an honour. Loftus Versveld Operations Manager Hugo Kemp says:”We have had many international events but this I think it’s the cherry on top. It’s even bigger and better than the world cup. So we are privileged to be part of this process and this great event.” It goes without saying that the stadium precinct will be under heavy security as South Africa will be hosting a high number of heads of state and diplomats. Contingency plans and alternative routes are in place to accommodate those that may be inconvenienced on the 25th of May when Cyril Ramaphosa is installed as President of the republic.
