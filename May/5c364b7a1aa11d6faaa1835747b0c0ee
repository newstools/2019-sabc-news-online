Former Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn Boshe, says unity in Africa is paramount in order for the continent to achieve peace. He was speaking at the 10th Thabo Mbeki Africa Day lecture in Pretoria on Friday night, under the theme, The National question, Peace, and democracy in Africa”. Boshe says democratic processes are also important in ensuring that Africa achieves peace, conflict resolution, and a booming economy, but stresses that this can only be done the African way. “The Western democratic principles are not on our side. Because this functions in a homogenous society, we are a heterogeneous society, we are multinationals, how can we address this, we need specific African solutions to our problems.” Boshe also says the historic victory of African forces in Ethiopia over Italian aggressors in the 19th century shows the power of African unity against external forces. He says Africa continues to battle with issues of division and ethnic differences. However, he says much can be achieved when Africans stand together. Meanwhile, former President Thabo Mbeki has expressed concern about the resurgence of identity politics in South Africa and in many other parts of the continent. Mbeki was giving the opening comments at the Africa Day Lecture in Pretoria. He says countries like South Africa are still grappling with the issue of nationhood. The former president says South Africa still has some way to go in establishing an inclusive national identity. Click on the videos below:
