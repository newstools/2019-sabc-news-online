The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has reiterated that it wants to take the mayoral position in the Tshwane Metro Municipality in Pretoria. Deputy President Floyd Shivambu says they have already met with the Democratic Alliance (DA) to discuss their proposal as the parties prepare for the local government elections in two years’ time. He says where there were no outright winners, fair leadership should be constituted. Shivambu says they are not expecting “No” for an answer from the DA. “Our concrete and firm proposal is that the EFF must take the Mayorship of Tshwane and must have all members in mayoral committees in all the other municipalities where there were no outright winners; where we had voted with the DA. That is one decision that we have taken that we are now entering into government and because there were no outright winners in the 2016 local government elections.” Click below for more on the story:
