Tunisia ordered the army on Friday to transport fuel to filling stations on Friday, the second day of a strike by fuel distribution workers that has caused empty pumps and long queues across the country. The three-day walkout began on Thursday to press demands for higher wages. The government is facing rising public demands for more pay with inflation at about 7%. It is also contending with pressure from international lenders to cut the public wage bill and other spending to shore up state finances.
