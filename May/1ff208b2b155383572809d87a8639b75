The Northern Cape Premier, Dr Zamani Saul, has reduced his executive council from 10 to nine MEC’s.  Saul announced his new executive council in Kimberley on Wednesday morning. He says the members should not join the provincial executive to maximise their personal benefits, but should put the interests of the people first. The new Education MEC is MacCollen Jack and Health is Mase Manopole. Saul says these are the two critical departments, who’s performance in the past he was not happy with.
