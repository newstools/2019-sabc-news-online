Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, will be back in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on June 20 for closing arguments. Duduzane Zuma has pleaded not guilty to charges of culpable homicide as well as reckless and negligent driving, in connection with a car crash that left one person dead in 2014. On Thursday, an accident reconstruction expert told the court that damages to Zuma’s car and the minibus taxi that he crashed into showed the suspect was not likely to have been driving at high speed. However, state prosecutor Yusuf Baba raised discrepancies in Zuma’s testimony regarding the speed he was travelling at, at the time of the crash. Baba said Zuma said in his insurance claim that he’d been driving at around 70 kilometres per hour. However, during testimony estimated the speed to have been between 90 and 100 kilometres per hour.
