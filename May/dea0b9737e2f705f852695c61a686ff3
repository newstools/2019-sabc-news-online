Boko Haram jihadists have seized a military base in northeast Nigeria, days
after an attack left five troops dead and 30 missing, security sources and
residents said Saturday. A column of fighters from the IS-affiliated Islamic State West Africa
Province (ISWAP) in trucks and on motorcycles stormed into the base in the town
of Magumeri, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the Borno state capital Maiduguri
late Friday. The militants overran the base for several hours, hauling away weapons
before they were forced out. “The terrorists dislodged troops from the base after an intense
fight,” a military officer told AFP. “We lost weapons and equipment to the terrorists but it is not clear if
there was any human loss,” said the officer, who asked not to be named. The jihadists arrived in the town around 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) and engaged
troops in an hour-long fight before they “gained the upper hand and chased
the troops away,” militia leader Gremah Kaka told AFP. “The insurgents overpowered the soldiers and forced them to flee into
the bush,” he said. Kaka said the jihadists stayed in the base for “more than four
hours” before they were dislodged by reinforcements from another base in
Gubio, 46 kilometres away. Last week, the jihadists raided a military base in Mararrabar Kimba, 135
kilometres from Maiduguri, killing five troops and stealing weapons, while some
30 troops are listed as missing. ISWAP has since July last year targeted dozens of military bases in
attacks that saw the jihadists kill scores of soldiers. The military authorities have always denied any casualties. Boko Haram’s decade-long campaign of violence has killed 27,000 people and
displaced around two million in Nigeria. The conflict has also spilled over into neighbouring Niger, Chad and
Cameroon.
