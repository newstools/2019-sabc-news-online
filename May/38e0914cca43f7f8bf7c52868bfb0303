Miners who have been staging an underground sit-in for the past five days at Orkney mine near Klerksdorp in North West abandoned their protest on Wednesday night. The 69 workers were demanding a wage increment of 15%, but the Chinese Africa Precious Metal Company which owns the mine had only offered 8% and also offered the mine workers a R900 living out allowance. National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) regional secretary Masibulele Naki says that the negotiations with the mine are still continuing. “We are ironing out some outstanding issues as well as looking at the well-being of the miners who have been underground.” He adds: “They will be taken for a medical check-up. They will not come to work tomorrow (Thursday) and Friday – they will come back to work on Monday because they have to be fit enough before they go back underground. But those who were at the surface they will proceed to work.”
