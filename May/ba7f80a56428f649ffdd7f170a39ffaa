Author of the book Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule’s Web of Capture, Pieter-Louis Myburgh, says he is ready for his day in court. The African National Congress  Secretary-General has said he was seeking legal advice over the book that details his alleged corrupt reign when he was Premier of the Free State. Myburgh says according to his investigations, Magashule never embarked on projects for the benefit of black emerging businesses. He was speaking during a discussion of his book at the Free State University’s Bloemfontein campus on Thursday. Myburgh says everything Magashule has done was for his benefit and those close to him. “I think that’s so important to realise that there were opportunities for government in the Free State to empower people economically, you know emerging black business people, and in certain instances that I unpack in the book. The opportunities were hijacked and captured to enrich people close to Magashule and other politically connected people in this province and that is actually a sad indictment of the approach of transforming the society and transforming the economy,” says Myburgh.
