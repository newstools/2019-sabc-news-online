Pensioners in Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, are still in the dark about their social grants. They claim to have been defrauded and say they haven’t been compensated as promised by the social security agency (Sassa). However, Sassa insists all the scam victims have been compensated. Since November, pensioners lost their social grants to unknown people. As a result, their grants are being withdrawn in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. 62-year-old Bathabile Mahlangu changed her card after the scam. She says, “I have done all that was expected of me since I lost the money, but I haven’t been paid. I don’t see a reason to vote for the ruling party. They don’t care about us. Why should I vote on Wednesday?” Another pensioner, Sobathazi Mtshweni is now getting paid through the bank. He too lost his social grant. “I have lost my money, but I asked for all the paper work. I was promised to be called once it has been sorted. But until now, I haven’t received anything. I now get paid in a bank as I made a bank card instead of the Sassa card.” Sassa is adamant those swindled out of their grants have been compensated. Sassa Mpumalanga Spokesperson, Senzeni Ngubeni, says that they have tightened loopholes that allowed the scams to happen. “We have tightened the loop holes that allowed for the scam to take place. Therefore, those who lost their money during the time were asked to go to the police and get affidavit to prove they lost their money without their knowledge. They have been sorted after they were given coupons and reimbursed.” SASSA Media Release: SASSA plead with social grant beneficiaries to protect their cards and pin codes. #SASSACARES @PostofficeSa @The_DSD @GCISMedia @GovernmentZA @nda_rsa pic.twitter.com/SiQI0m8xyh — SASSA (@OfficialSASSA) April 16, 2019
