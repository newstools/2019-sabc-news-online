Duduzane Zuma will be back in the Randburg Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, following charges of culpable homicide and reckless driving. Zuma is expected to take the stand as the first witness. The son of former President Jacob Zuma is on trial for a crash which led to the death of a taxi passenger in February 2014. In March this year, the court dismissed Zuma’s application to have the culpable homicide charge against him discharged. The trial is set down for three days. Earlier this year, another case implicating Zuma in corruption was provisionally withdrawn. Watch a related video below:
