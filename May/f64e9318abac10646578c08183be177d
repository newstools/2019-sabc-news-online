The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is concerning, but not surprising, that the list of new Gauteng MECs include those who they believe have a dismal track record in government. Premier David Makhura has appointed his 10 member executive council, which includes new six new faces and four from the previous administration. The Provincial Government says the newly appointed MECs reflect a mix of experience, new energy and fresh ideas. Makhura announced the names of the MECs in a statement earlier on Wednesday. “I mean if you have to think about Faith Mazibuko and her racial slurs just two months ago were made very public. Somebody like Lebogang Maile who has failed so much in the economic development and now is going to be heading human settlements, something that is going to need some serious intervention. Jacob Mamabolo, under his watch, the bank of Lisbon building fire occurred while, many faults, other government departments were identified but no steps were taken to address these life-threatening issues,” says DA Gauteng Caucus leader Solly Msimanga.
