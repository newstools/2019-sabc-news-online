The controversy around Pravin Gordhan‘s reappointment to cabinet will be among the issues discussed at the ANC’s NEC meeting in Irene, Pretoria. Gordhan was retained as State Enterprises minister on Wednesday, amid damning findings by the Public Protector that he violated the Constitution by approving early retirement for then SARS deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay. The appointment of Gordhan has come under fire, criticised by some opposition parties and even from within ANC ranks. While the EFF has called Gordhan a “constitutional delinquent”, senior ANC leaders including Tony Yengeni and Mzwandile Masina took to Twitter, slamming Gordhan’s appointment as undermining the rule of law.  The ANC says Gordhan’s matter is on the agenda and critics within the party will be called to order. The ANC’s top decision making structure is meeting to discuss the party’s performance in the May elections. Also ANC Youth League members staged a protest outside the venue over the league’s leadership problems, calling for the disbandment of their leadership, which they say is illegitimate. The Youth League has threatened to March to Luthuli House on Tuesday if their demands are not met. But the current leader says there are legitimate reasons for the delay in holding an elective conference.
