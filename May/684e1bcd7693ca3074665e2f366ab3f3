 Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is expected to appear before the Equality Court sitting at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court north of Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. This is in connection with a statement he made at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The comments were allegedly made in an audio recording played at the Inquiry in which Agrizzi is heard using the K-word numerous times. The SA Human Rights Commission has approached the Equality Court concerning the utterances. The Commission’s Buang Jones says, “We are seeking an order directing Mr Agrizzi to pay damages and an order directing Mr Agrizzi to issue a non-conditional apology to all South Africans. And an order directing Mr Agrizzi to undergo diversity and sensitive programmes.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
