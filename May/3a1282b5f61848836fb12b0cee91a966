A plot to kill members of a task team investigating political killings could be true. That’s according to an independent violence observer in KwaZulu-Natal. Police Minister Bheki Cele, on Thursday, claimed there was a hit-list targeting policemen. At a memorial service for slain Newcastle ANC actvist, Martin Sithole, Cele said police had information of a plot targeting the task team investigators. “A group of people met in Durban to plot to kill the police that are arresting killers. These people stayed at a BnB. We know who are they are, we know how many of them were there and we also know what they do for a living. In that meeting there were also politicians. These politicians are the same politicians who hurl insults at me.” An independent violence monitor says Cele’s claims are not far-fetched. “It’s possible. I mean the minister is in a position to know and the fact of the matter is that there are organized hit networks in this province and that’s why they can operate against politicians or corruption busters or taxi operators,” says Mary de Haas of Violence Monitor. Cele said police have already made a breakthrough in the Sithole murder. Sithole and a bystander Bathanani Shange died in a hail of bullets in broad daylight in Newcastle last weekend. Witnesses said unknown attackers in a car opened fire on the two men before speeding off. Police couldn’t confirm reports that Sithole was a witness in a politically-related murder case. WATCH BELOW:
