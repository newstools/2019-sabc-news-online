The hearing of an application for a permanent stay of prosecution by former President Jacob Zuma and his co-accused, Thales, will continue on Friday in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. On Thursday, the matter was adjourned just as Zuma’s senior counsel, Advocate Muzi Skhakhane, was about to submit new evidence about alleged political meddling in the case. Zuma and Thales face 16 counts of corruption, fraud and racketeering. Advocate Skhakhane was about to hand over a letter in court about an alleged meeting between senior politicians but State prosecutor, Advocate Wim Trengove, objected. In his objection, Trengove argued that the defence cannot bring new evidence before court. He said a formal application will have to be made and the court will then have to make a decision. Zuma’s lawyers blame the delays entirely on the State. However, Trengove argued both the State and Zuma must take responsibility for the delay caused by the then National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head, Mokotedi Mpshe, striking the case off the roll in 2009.
