African National Congress (ANC) deputy president David Mabuza has been sworn in as Member of Parliament at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon. He postponed his swearing in ceremony last week requesting that he still had to respond to the ANC’s Integrity Commission report. The report followed allegations of corruption levelled against him while he was still the premier of Mpumalanga. While it is still not clear when President Cyril Ramaphosa is going to announce his new executive, Mabuza’s swearing in as an MP paves way for him to become the country’s deputy president. He was sworn in by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. Watch video below:
