COPE has accused Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane of factionalism and trying to distract President Cyril Ramaphosa in appointing his cabinet. This, after Mkhwebane released a report on Friday that found Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan guilty of improper conduct. The report is related to Gordhan granting then SARS Deputy Commissioner, Ivan Pillay an early retirement during his time as Finance Minister. COPE Spokesperson, Dennis Bloem has also called on Parliament to remove Mkhwebane. “We know that it was aimed to destabilise and to distract the President with announcing his cabinet. That is a clear sign that this Public Protector is showing factional tendencies because she is not coming up with a report of Estina Dairy. We want Parliament to remove this Public Protector as soon as possible.” Meanwhile, COPE has congratulated Cyril Ramaphosa on his inauguration as President. Ramaphosa was inaugurated in Pretoria, on Saturday in a multi-million-rand celebration. The party has emphasised that the President will have to shrink his bloated cabinet. The President is expected to announce his cabinet on Monday. Bloem says, “We want him to cut this cabinet and do away with Deputy Ministers. Corrupt individuals must not be appointed because this country cannot afford this corruption anymore. But we wish him well and we wish him all the wisdom for the future.” Click on related video below:
