Former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo says he blames the ANC for not taking disciplinary action against some party members who have been found guilty in court and who are still taking part in the affairs of the organisation. He was speaking at a media briefing after convicted former Mahikeng local municipality ANC councillor Gaasite Legalatladi petitioned the North West High court in Mahikeng, regarding her application for leave to appeal her case. She is appealing both her conviction and five year sentence that was passed by the Lehurutshe Regional Court in October last year. She was found guilty of planning to kill Mahumapelo. A date will be issued for a full bench of judges to decide on the matter. Legalatladi consulted a traditional healer at Masebudule near Zeerust two years ago who agreed to help her to eliminate Mahumapelo. This she would do by using muti to execute the plan for Mahumapelo to die. The traditional leader alerted the police about the plot. A trap was set up at the home of the traditional healer for Legalatladi to be arrested.
