Thousands of illegal small scale miners in Namaqualand in the Northern Cape say they will boycott Wednesday’s national general elections. The miners say over the past few years, their pleas to be legalised and given permits by the government have been ignored. They say engagements with the Department of Mineral Resources are not yet yielding results – leaving them in a state of desperation. One of the miners says enough is enough. “It’s very difficult as a man to wake up in the morning and look at my women and I see that cry, that cry of hunger. We are not going to vote due to the fact that the government is not listening to the diggers of Namaqua. We are fighting this process since 2010. We as the diggers of Namaqua say enough is enough,” he says. Click on related the video below:
