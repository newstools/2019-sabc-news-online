The African National Congress alliance partners in the North West and its structures, except the Women’s League, have thrown their weight behind incumbent Premier Job Mokgoro to be retained. This comes after the party’s highest structure, the NEC, failed to conclusively appoint a premier elect, citing further consultations. South African Communist Party‘s provincial secretary, Madoda Sambatha, and Congress of South African Trade Union‘s provincial chairperson, Solly Lekhu, say Mokgoro should be given space to steer the province out of service delivery challenges. The ANC Women’s League in the province is advocating for a woman candidate. The League has nominated three names. Provincial Secretary Bridget Tlhomelang says, “We want them to consider the following name, Pinki Moloi, former Mayor of DKK, she was doing well. The second is comrade Meokgo Matuba who is a former Municipal Manager at Taung and the third name we want is Basetsana Suzie Danjie, the former Speaker.”
