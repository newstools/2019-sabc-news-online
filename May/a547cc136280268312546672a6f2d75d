The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (CASAC) says should it win today’s (Monday) court case regarding the Vrede Dairy Farm report, it will ask that the Public Protector’s office be excluded from dealing with the matter. The High Court in Pretoria will on Monday deliver judgement in the case in which CASAC seeks to have Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s report on the controversial dairy project declared unconstitutional and set aside. In 2018, Mkhwebane released her report and has been accused by CASAC of protecting politicians such as African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, during her investigation. CASAC Executive Secretary Lawson Naidoo says law enforcement and the new NDPP Shamila Batohi should be tasked with bringing those involved to book. “Advocate Mkhwebane fundamentally altered the remedial action that was in the previous draft report declared by her predecessor Advocate Madonsela.” “We do not want her to re-investigate the matter given that the law enforcement authorities are now dealing with the matter, it must now be left up to the law enforcement agencies with the reconstituted and reinvigorated prosecuting authority to pursue criminal charges against those involved.” Related video click below:
