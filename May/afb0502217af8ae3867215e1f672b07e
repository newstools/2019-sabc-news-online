Following a year of preparations, Parliament says it’s all systems go for the swearing in of its Members of Parliament (MPs) this week. On Wednesday, members of the National Assembly will be sworn in as members of the sixth Parliament, and on Thursday it will be the turn of those who will serve in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). MPs have started making their way to Cape Town to report to Parliament. The new designated members are having their personal details captured. They will also register for the range of facilities and perks they are granted as Members of Parliament. A simulation of the swearing in is also part of the plan to make the new MPs comfortable with the process. In the event of there being more than one nomination for the position of Speaker, Deputy President and President, all necessary arrangements are in place for that vote by secret ballot. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will preside over the swearing in of the 400 new MPs.
