The Tiso Blackstar Group has announced that its tabloid newspaper Sunday World will be shutting down. The group will also embark on retrenchments across a range of its publications including the Sowetan, The Herald and the Daily Dispatch. The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) says they are disturbed about the closure of these publications which is an indication that there is a bigger crisis in the media industry. “We are quite concerned because this has been the trend in the past couple of years where we saw the closure of the Huffington post and also saw the closure of another Tiso publication, the Times but we also know that in between that there’s also been retrenchments at other companies, Media 24, The Independent newspaper and that is quite concerning, because it has an impact on the quality of news that we are able to continue to pursue,” says Mahlatse Mahlase who is the chairperson of SANEF.
