Gauteng Premier David Makhura is on Tuesday expected to announce his provincial executive council in Parktown, Johannesburg. Members of the Executive Council will then be sworn in by Judge President Dunstan Mlambo. Makhura was sworn in last week after he was elected in the provincial Legislature. This is Makhura’s second term as Gauteng Premier. Makhura’s first term was marred by the Life Esidimeni tragedy in which 143 psychiatric patients died after they were moved to unlicensed and ill-equipped NGOs. During his first term, Premier Makhura’s strategy was centred around transformation, modernization and re-industrialization, as well as the revitalisation of the township economy. With the new executive council to be announced on Tuesday, Makhura will have another chance to continue with work he started in 2014. “There are many areas we have done well, and there are also many areas we completely need to change course,” says the Premier. Having unsuccessfully tried to do away with e-tolls in his first term, the big question is whether Makhura will succeed this time. Click below video of Gauteng Premier David Makhura…
