More employees at the SABC’s Radio Park building in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, could suffer from headaches and nausea if they continue to be exposed to diesel fumes. That’s according to Dr Nelisiwe Sibisi from the Thele Mokgorane hospital in Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg. On Monday, several employees had to be sent home after suffering from headaches and nausea – allegedly as a result of inhaling the diesel fumes. On Wednesday last week, the building was evacuated following the diesel leak. Johannesburg Emergency Services declared it safe on Sunday. Dr Sibisi says symptoms of exposure to diesel fumes can range from irritation of the eyes to discomfort in the stomach. “The symptoms that the workers are complaining about, they are real and they need to be taken seriously. Because exposure can lead to irritation. It can be irritation of the eyes, it can be irritation of the respiratory tract and sometimes it can be irritation of the skin depending on the level of exposure and because they are inhaling all these fumes and smells, it is legitimate that the will get nausea and discomfort in the stomach and chest problems and headaches. So all those problems are quite legitimate.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
