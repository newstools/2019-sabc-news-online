Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama has vowed to continue showing his support for former President Jacob Zuma. Mngxitama was speaking outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court ahead of Zuma’s application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma faces 16 charges of corruption, racketeering and fraud.  Mgxitama says the charges levelled against Zuma are a political attack as Zuma stands for radical economic transformation. “Nine years later Zuma’s cases are showing up. This is a political attack, we know why, he is for radical transformation. Sadly his party, the ANC, is the one that is teaching him this lesson. We stand with him for that reason. We know after Zuma, it’s us, Brian Molefe, it’s Dudu Myeni.  Any Black person who stands for radical transformation is going to be criminalised by this regime of Ramaphosa.” The Zuma court case which has been set down for the whole week in the Pietermaritzburg High Court is expected to draw support from thousands of South Africans who have travelled from other provinces. Organiser of support for Zuma, Nkosentsha Shezi, says people have come in from around the country to show solidarity with the former President. “Whenever we draw support and organise support for Mr Zuma, it’s people around the country who drive through the provinces of South Africa to come and show their support to President Zuma. We are really standing here in solidarity and in support of the father of RET, and land expropriation without compensation, President Jacob Zuma. We are looking at today as the big day, main day where large support will be coming.”
