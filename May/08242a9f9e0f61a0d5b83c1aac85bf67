National Director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate Shamila Bathohi, is introducing Advocate Hermione Cronje as head of the National Prosecuting Authorityâ€™s (NPA) so-called state capture investigative arm for the next five years. The NDPP will also provide details on the legal framework, powers, duties and functions of the Investigating Directorate and an overview of its priorities.
