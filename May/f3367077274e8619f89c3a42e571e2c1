Former president Thabo Mbeki has been honoured for the role he played in the development of South African and the rest of the African continent. The University of South Africa (UNISA) Library, together with the Thabo Mbeki Presidential Library and UNISA Art Gallery, is hosting an exhibition in his honour. The displayed material consists of artworks, letters, and photographs that showcase the participation of Mbeki and his wife Zanele in the liberation of South Africa, African renaissance, peace and prosperity in the entire continent. “This is a real space of reflection, looking at particularly the former president Thabo Mbeki’s life and also looking at his wife. As people that have uplifted our society, South Africa and Africa as a whole. If you go through the space in the gallery, you will see that it is a dialogue, a conversation and it looks at pivotal points in the former president’s life and Mrs Mbeki,” says Afro Visionary Legacy CEO, Lebogang Chaka. Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation, Max Boqwana, says they feel honoured to share the former President’s work and ideas with the global community through an exhibition of such magnitude.
