Western Cape African National Congress (ANC) member Lionel Adendorf insists he’s still the party’s provincial spokesperson despite the Provincial Executive Committee relieving him of his duties as Political Head of Communications. It said all communications would now come from the office of its Provincial Secretary. Reports of a factional leadership battle in the ANC in the Western Cape have surfaced, including over a one-million rand donation recently made to the party allegedly by businessman Iqbal Surve. Adendorf says he’s not been relieved of his duties. “There has not been a PEC meeting to relieve me of my duties. Any other decision taken by any other structures can certainly not be the right decision or legitimate. I must add that it is not a position that I wanted or that I applied for. Being spokesperson of the ANC comes with the duties of the head of the PEC communications and media. So, I am not sure where the idea comes from that I have been relieved of my duties,” explains Adendorf. The ANC’s Dennis Cruywagen says the party does not recognise Adendorf as its provincial spokesperson. “It was a unanimous decision taken. Comrade Lionel has been informed by now I think about that party decision and the ANC has also resolved that as a tradition in the ANC that communication in the Western Cape should come from the office of Provincial Secretary Faiez Jacobs. All communications will come from him,” says Cruywagen.
