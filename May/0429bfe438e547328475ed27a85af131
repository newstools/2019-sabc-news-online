Newly appointed African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina has vowed that members of the party will robustly carry out their oversight role over the executive.  Majodina says while the caucus will not seek confrontation, it will be firm in its role. She was speaking shortly after a special caucus meeting attended by the party’s top leadership, which included party President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy David Mabuza. The meeting was to introduce the new leadership of the party in Parliament. “My first three objectives and on the ANC caucus is to ensure that as the ANC caucus we are not lame ducks. We are going to ensure that we lay our robust oversight on the executive without creating tensions but in line with the manifesto, because as the ANC caucus, we are going to unpack the manifestly terms of implementation plan time frames and that’s what we’re going to do but also to ensure that members of  the ANC rise to the occasion.”
