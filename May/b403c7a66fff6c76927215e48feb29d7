Parliament says it is expecting the lists of political parties candidates by Wednesday before preparations can be made. The lists are expected to be handed over by the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng who will preside over the swearing in of Members of Parliament in the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Secretary to the National Assembly, Masibulele Xaso, says as soon as the lists have been handed over to Parliament they will start the process of preparing members. ” That will enable us to contact the members to make arrangements for the members to come to Parliament to interact with them on a range of issues. Some members will take the oath, others will do affirmations. We need to clarify those issues but you can only do that, once we know who is coming to Parliament”. The Chief Justice is still expected to announce the dates for the swearing in ceremony. However, provisional dates set for swearing in National Assembly MPs are the 22nd May and the 23rd of May for permanent delegates of the NCOP.
