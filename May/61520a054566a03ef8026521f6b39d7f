Police have recovered a white Toyota Quantum which looks like the one that a group of armed robbers used to get away after a robbery at the Viva Foundation Pre-School in Mamemlodi, east of Pretoria. The vehicle was found abandoned near the crime scene. The robbers allegedly took belongings of 19 international students and their professors who were visiting the school on an outreach programme. An employee of the school and a member of public were wounded when the suspects fired shots randomly. Gauteng police commissioner, General Elias Mawela explains how they recovered the quantum. “What I can report to the nation is that few minutes ago we’ve recovered the ‘khumbi’ which was used yesterday. The forensic experts are in it to obtain the DNA evidence in that khumbi and we believe that very soon we’ll arrest these suspects and we are also happy in the manner in which the people of Mamelodi have responded to us. They don’t like what had happened, and a majority of them are telling us that they will keep their ears on the ground,” explains Mawela.
