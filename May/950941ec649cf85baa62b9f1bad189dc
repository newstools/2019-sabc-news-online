The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa)Â Board and Group CEO, Dr Nkosinathi Sishi have placed various executives on suspension and special leave. This decision follows the outcomes and ongoing investigations that have dogged Prasa of improper, irregular, corrupt, fruitless and wasteful expenditure by various employees of Prasa at all levels of the organisation. Two executives, namely Dr Sipho Sithole and Martha Ngoye have been placed on suspension. Whilst Tiro Holele, an executive in the office of the Group CEO has been placed on special leave. The suspension and placement on special leave of these executives is to ensure a fair process based on a principle of innocent until proven guilty.
