Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma has taken the stand in his culpable homicide trial in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. He is testifying on the sequence of events that occurred on the night when he crashed into a minibus taxi in 2014. Zuma is facing one count of culpable homicide and another of reckless and negligent driving. He was initially charged with two counts of culpable homicide, however the second count was withdrawn when the trial commenced in March. Zuma’s vehicle, a Porche 911 turbo, crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 highway in January 2014, resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube. He maintains that he lost control of his vehicle after hitting a water puddle, which resulted in the crash. Watch related video:
