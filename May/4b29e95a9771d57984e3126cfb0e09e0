Former Human Settlement Minister Tokyo Sexwale says he’s hoping that there will be a generational mix in the new Cabinet. “We want a strong Cabinet that consists of strong men and women of character, not some yes mams,” adds Sexwale. In a few hours from now President Cyril Ramaphosa will be inaugurated as the President of the country at the Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria. About 30 000 people are expected to attend the ceremony. Nelson Mandela’s eldest grandson Mandla Mandela says he hopes Ramaphosa will focus on youth empowerment in rural areas. Meanwhile, Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu says she is not worried about whether she will return to Cabinet. “I’m not worried about that… if the President feels that I should serve I will do that because it’s not about ambitions to return to cabinet but it’s about service delivery.” Shabangu added that she hopes that the new government will give all young females who dropped out of school because of pregnancy a chance to return to school. Minister of Small Business Development Lindiwe Zulu says this is the beginning of the new dawn. This year, government announced that the ceremony will not be held Union Buildings as it has been doing in previous years. This will allow for more public attendance and participation. The ceremony will be attended by religious, traditional leaders, as well as leaders from the continent. Government has urged members of the public using their own vehicles to park at the Tshwane Events Centre (commonly known as the Pretoria Show Grounds), where a park and ride service will be available. No private cars will be allowed around the stadium and those who will be attending have been advanced not bring any weapons and alcohol.
