The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) has defended its gender and race representation in the National Assembly, saying people were chosen on merit. The party’s ten members in the House are all white and only two are women. The FF Plus is now the fifth biggest party in the National Assembly. Over the past four elections, the smaller political parties have been losing votes except for the FF Plus. Freedom Front Plus Chairperson Anton Alberts says, “We are not a racist party. We do not have racist policies. In fact, our policies are aligned with international law. If you to join the European Union as a country, you have to protect minorities.” He adds: “We are trying to bring a balance between the minorities in South Africa and the majority, if anything we are trying to bring stability to South Africa.” Click on the video below:
