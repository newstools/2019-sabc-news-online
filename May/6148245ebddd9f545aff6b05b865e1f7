 Frustrated security officers working in 29 health facilities in the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District in Taung area in the North West have embarked on a wage strike on Wednesday morning. The security guards have reportedly not been paid, for the last three months. The disgruntled security officials, working for Nomaduku Security services, have converged outside Taung District Hospital, singing and chanting slogans, demanding payment of their salaries. Nomaduku security services is reported to have hired 100 officials in about 29 health facilities in the Dr Ruth Mompati district. The company says it is unable to pay the workers, because they have also not received payment from the provincial Department of Health. However, the department says it is unable to pay the service provider, as they accuse its management of charging the department double VAT. However, the striking security officers have allowed staff at the Taung District Hospital to continue their duties. WATCH BELOW:
