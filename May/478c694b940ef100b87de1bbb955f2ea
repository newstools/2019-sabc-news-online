Gauteng Health Officials have denied that they are out of stock of diabetes and cancer medications at some hospitals. They were responding to complaints raised by the Democratic Alliance‘s Jack Bloom. Bloom has called on the Gauteng Health Department officials to address the issue. “I’m very concerned because I’ve had reports of medicine shortages for cancer treatment at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital, also diabetes medication at the George Mukhari hospital. These are vital and essential medicines – that’s how they are defined and there should never be stock outs of any cancer medication or medication for diabetes. Insulin is absolutely essential for diabetes patients.” Head of Hospital Services, Doctor Medupi Modisane, says there are no stock-outs of insulin at any of their facilities. Modisane says a certain cancer drug can only be obtained overseas and there are minor challenges being experienced.
