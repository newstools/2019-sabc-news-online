Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Secretary General, Velenkosini Hlabisa, says should the IFP win elections, the party-led government will provide young people with technical skills training so that they can be absorbed into the mainstream of the economy. He was addressing a mini-rally at Nongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Hlabisa also lashed out at the education system in the country, saying that it does not respond to the skills needed by the economy. “We want to target young people. These people are still active in building the economy. The IFP will target the production of skilled young people, artisans, plumbers and mechanics, the people who will be given funding when they complete their training so that they can begin their projects and open up their businesses and thereby employing others, thereby creating job opportunities,” says Hlabisa.
