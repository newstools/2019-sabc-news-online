The endorsement of Sisi Ntombela as the Free State premier elect has brought divisions within the ANC Youth League at the Xhariep region. The league’s regional secretary, Solly Phama, has dismissed a statement by Lonwabo Dyi, who he claims has been expelled. Meanwhile, the Youth League in the province has endorsed Ntombela’s nomination as premier elect. Claims that structures of the ANCYL in the Free State are at loggerheads over the name of Ntombela have been dismissed. Phama says Dyi was dismissed in 2016. “In as far as the Youth League is concerned in Xhariep, Mr Lonwabo Dyi is not a member of ANCYL, nor does he lead any structure of the ANC in Xhariep. We therefore dismiss with disgust the statement that his issued. We understand that what his doing is propelled by him maintaining his stomach.” Dyi is adamant that he’s still very much active in the Xhariep regional executive of the ANCYL. “We came to the conclusion that we cannot endorse her, but let us rather look from within the ANC other comrades that are capable of such.” Meanwhile the provincial Youth League has refuted claims that Xhariep is against Ntombela. Provincial ANCYL Spokesperson, Sello Piertesen, says that Dyi requires psychological support. “The statement really released by one excited young fellow who is not even a member of the Youth League in that particular region called Lonwabo Dyi. He has been excited for quite some time so in our view, he required some psychological support.” The provincial Youth League also distanced itself from the recently leaked list of the preferred MEC candidates in the province.
