 To mark World Telecommunication Day, Telkom has launched its fibre rollout in Soweto at the Orlando West High School. The rollout is in partnership with the Department of Communications. Telkom Group CEO, Sipho Maseko, says this will prepare pupils for the changing world as the fourth industrial revolution will require technology skills. The school was chosen for its historical significance as it was at the centre of the 1976 student uprisings. Internet connectivity is also seen as a catalyst to revitalise the economy. Part of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s economic recovery plan includes driving down data costs and revitalising township economies. Telkom says it hopes to partner with government to expand the programme to other schools in the country – bridging the connectivity gap, lowering data costs and promoting economic development. Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says government is engaging with industry in terms of allocation of spectrum, and that policy direction will be announced soon.   Pupils say they’ve been yearning for access to internet at the school and this will make learning easier and help them produce quality work. World Telecommunications Day is celebrated every year on May 17 to mark the establishment of the International Telecommunication Union.   WATCH BELOW:
