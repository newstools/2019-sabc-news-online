Former Police Minister, Bheki Cele has inspected the stadium to review the safety and security performance of law enforcement agencies, following the Presidential Inauguration at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria. Cele has thanked the men and women in blue for ensuring safety and security during the event. Cele has congratulated the police for a job well done in administering the Inauguration. He also commended the forces for the way in which it handled security issues. “You have been wonderful for South Africa, not yesterday only. We said going to May the 8th, it was before, during and after. That segment of life officers has been finalized. Elections, all that happened coming to yesterday. What a beautiful segment of life together, you have done and together you have put together…I just wonder if you did not do what you did yesterday, what outcome would have been?” Police commissioner, General Khehla Sithole, says reward packages await the police for their hard work. “I have issued an instruction that within two weeks from now all of us must be paid what we are entitled to. The administration must have been finalized. I don’t want a single member complaining about not receiving what is due to them.” Cele says the law enforcement agencies must go home and rest, but must not forget the culture to stop and search, ensuring safety within the country.
