Trade union, Bemawu, plans to take legal action against the President and the Ministers of Finance and Communication for failing to provide the cash-strapped SABC with financial assistance. The move comes after more than 2 000 litres of diesel leaked from a back-up generator, which allegedly failed on the 15th floor of the public broadcaster’s Radio Park building during a power outage. The Auckland Park building, in Johannesburg, was evacuated and at least three people sent to the hospital. Two have since been discharged. Bemawu spokesperson Hannes du Buisson  says, “We are currently consulting our legal team with an intention to bring the applications to compel the Minister and the President and the Treasury to fund at least on an urgent basis the SABC to ensure that buildings are maintained properly.” While clean-up operations continue, around 1000 Radio Park staff members have been told to stay home until next week.
