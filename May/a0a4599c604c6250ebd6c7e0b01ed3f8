Former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss, Johan Booysen, is expected to continue giving testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Thursday morning. In April, Booysen began testifying about how law enforcement agencies in the province were captured. He told the Commission about top ranking officials including then KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Mmamonnye Ngobeni interfered in investigations. He also detailed how he visited former President Jacob Zumaâ€™s home in Nkandla twice to inform him of this. Two relatives of the former President were implicated in the investigations.
