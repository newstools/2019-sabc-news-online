The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) in KwaZulu-Natal has resumed its train services. This follows a three-week suspension following extensive floods that battered the province last month. The agency suspended services since the devastating April floods due to damage to rail infrastructure.  67 people were killed and thousands others left homeless. “After suspension of services for some time about three weeks where prasa took some time to look at the services that were affected due to floods which affect infrastructure but today on the 13th of May 2019 our services resumed. The trains are back only some small parts that are affected our engineers are busy fixing up the lines,” says Prasa  spokesperson,  Zama Nomnganga.
