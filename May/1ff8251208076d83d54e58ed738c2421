Striking workers at newspaper publisher, Tiso Blackstar have vowed to intensify their strike ahead of the elections next week. The company owns several media brands including Business Day, The Sowetan, Sunday World and The Sunday Times. The company share price has dwindled by 80% in the past eight years due to poor sales of newspapers. Workers are demanding a 20% wage increase, better working conditions and compulsory bonuses. Moshoeshoe Monare, Deputy Managing Director at Tiso Blackstar, says the company has put measures in place to avoid the impact of the strike on business. “We always have contingency plans for every industrial action, as you may have seen there were only about 20 people on strike which didn’t affect our operations at all. The certificate that the unions secured from the CCMA was regarding the payment of bonuses and also salary increases, that’s the issues that we deadlocked on. As a company it is in our best interest to engage and find the solution to this,” says Monare. Watch a related video below:
