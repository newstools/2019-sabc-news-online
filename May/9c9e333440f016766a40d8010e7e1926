South Africa will extradite Mozambiqueâ€™s former Finance Minister Manuel Chang, who has been held since December on a United State arrest warrant, to face corruption charges. Justice Minister Michael Masutha says Chang will be extradited to stand trial for his alleged offences. 63-year-old Chang was arrested at the OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg in December at the request of US authorities over alleged involvement in fraudulent loans to Mozambique state firms worth $2-billion. Masutha has said the interest of justice will be best served by acceding to the request by the Republic of Mozambique. Mozambique has accused Chang of receiving $17-million in kickbacks in a scam which creamed off hundreds of millions. Click on related videos below:
