Speakers at the funeral of the late struggle stalwart and former Robben Island prisoner, Mfengu Makhalima have described him as a principled leader who sacrificed his life for liberation of the oppressed. They were addressing congregants at his funeral at Mxhelo village near Alice in the Eastern Cape. President Cyril Ramaphosa had granted a Special Provincial official funeral Category 2 for him. Premier Phumulo Masualle says Makalima always encouraged young leaders to empower themselves with education and serve the people with diligence. “He was passionate about the role of the masses in all that is done. In fact he would say that a leader must be a puppet of the masses. He say leaders speak what the people want. He was very deep in practical foundation and referenced it on perspective,” says Masualle. The family says they are devastated. His daughter, Vuyolwethu Makalima says they have learnt a lot from him. “I have learnt to stand up for myself. I have learnt that education is important, family is important and the people around you is what makes you as a person. I have learnt that you never ever abandon your family no matter what, ,and the nation you stand as one,” says Vuyolwethu Makalima. Watch video below:
