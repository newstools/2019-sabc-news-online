As President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s announcement of his Cabinet and deputy ministers is imminent, we look at some of the appointing powers of the President in terms of sections 84 and 91 of the Constitution. After assuming office, the President as head of Cabinet appoints the Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers from among the 400 members of the National Assembly. He may select not more than two ministers who are not members of the National Assembly. In terms of appointing his deputy, the President must select the Deputy President from among members of the National Assembly as provided for in section 91 of the Constitution. As much as he has the power to appoint his Cabinet and deputy Ministers, he may also dismiss them. President Ramaphosa is expected to announce his new Cabinet and deputy ministers soon. While speculation has been rife that a female Deputy President may be appointed, the swearing in of ANC Deputy President David Mabuza as MP later on Tuesday may diminish the possibility of having a female Deputy President.
