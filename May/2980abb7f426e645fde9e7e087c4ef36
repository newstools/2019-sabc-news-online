Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he’s prepared to have all corruption cases in the city prosecuted privately, if the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) declines to take action. Mashaba says he has provided the Hawks and the NPA with “overwhelming” evidence of rampant corruption in the city, yet no one is being prosecuted. On Thursday, he tweeted that the latest report by the City of Joburg’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS) revealed that graft cases amounting to R33 billion were still under investigation. The Mayor has now written to Hawks and NPA heads, General Godfrey Lebeya and advocate Shamila Bathoi, respectively, asking why no action is being taken despite damning findings from multiple investigations. “The letter I wrote to advocate Bathoi is to say please if they feel they don’t have a case against these people, please then nullify these cases. Because one thing for sure as the City of Johannesburg we would like to go for private prosecution. But we are prevented from going for private prosecution because the Constitution of the country says for you to be allowed to go for private prosecution is when the NPA says they don’t have a case. So I am asking them for the last two years, if you feel that you don’t have a case against those people, why don’t you nullify those cases.” Watch related video:
