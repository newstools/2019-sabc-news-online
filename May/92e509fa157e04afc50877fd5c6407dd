President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce his new cabinet at 8pm on Wednesday amid uncertainty about the positions of Pravin Gordhan and David Mabuza. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found Gordhan guilty of improper conduct for his decision as Finance Minister to grant former South African Revenue Service Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay early retirement with full benefits. Mabuza was only sworn in as a Member of Parliament on Tuesday having requested a postponement so that he could appear before the African National Congress’ (ANC) Integrity Commission to respond to the ANC’s Integrity Commission report.
