The two men convicted of killing a teenager in Coligny in North West have been denied leave to appeal their sentences in the North West High Court in Mmabatho. Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutter were convicted of killing 16-year old Matlhomola Moshoeu and sentenced to 18 and 23 years in jail respectively. They were represented by Senior Council Barry Roux who was acting on behalf of AfriForum. Moshoeu was killed after he was apparently caught stealing a sunflower. The court found that he died after being thrown off a moving vehicle but the men claimed that he jumped.
