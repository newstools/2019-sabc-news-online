A former Grade 9 learner of Sans Souci Girls’ High in Cape Town is expected to return to the Wynberg Magistrate’s court on Thursday, on a charge of assault. The girl and one of her teachers, Clarissa Venter, brought assault charges against each other after a physical altercation arose between them. In the incident that was recorded on video, the learner shoves a desk into the teacher who responds by slapping her. Venter returned to the school at the beginning of April after her suspension. She was fined and given a final warning. Her case is back in court on June 14. The learner’s case was postponed last week because the case file was not at court.
