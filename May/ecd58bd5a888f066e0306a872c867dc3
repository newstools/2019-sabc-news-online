 An announcement on a possible financial lifeline for the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is imminent. Minister of Communications and Telecommunications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says they are dealing with the matter urgently. On Friday afternoon Ndabeni-Abrahams was due to meet with Finance minister Tito Mboweni. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said the government was committed to help the SABC. An announcement on providing financial support will be made next week. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams:”I will be meeting with the Minister of Finance today (on Friday). He was there at the SABC himself to engage with the team so that he could also see the level of whatever that happened through the leaks of diesel in the radio park building.” “What we are trying to do is to say how do we make sure that we bring on board all the role players so that the work can be fast-tracked, because it is in our interest that the SABC gets to be financial viable.” Click video below:
