A video has surfaced showing hundreds of steel beds stored in the open at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto, Gauteng. The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the province says this is a waste of state assets, as the beds could be put to good use instead of being left out in the open to rust. DA Gauteng Health Spokesperson Jack Bloom says there are hospitals and non-profit institutions that are in need of beds.  “I think that these beds could be used elsewhere. I know a lot of proper institutions that would like these beds and now we have a huge wide stock of useful beds lying outside the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.” The Gauteng Health Department says it is investigating the matter.
