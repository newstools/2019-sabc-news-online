The search for three missing fishermen at Hawston in the Western Cape is expected to resume on Monday morning. Police divers widened their search for the missing fishermen on Sunday afternoon when they could not be traced. National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, says air, sea and ground searchers have been carried out along the coastline. Lambinon says the men went missing in the water after their boat capsized in rough water and stormy conditions. Rescue crews responded to the incident when they were alerted by family members.
