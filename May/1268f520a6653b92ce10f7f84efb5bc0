Gauteng police have arrested four people including a candidate attorney and a correctional services officer for fraud and theft. The victim alleges that they stole his bank card while withdrawing money from an ATM in Ebony Park north of Johannesburg. The victim alleges that he was assisted by three unknown men who stole his card and drove away in a vehicle which has been found to have been hired. Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini says, “They were acting as if they were assisting the victim, instead they stole his card. Few minutes later he saw that his money was withdrawn, but during the day he saw the same suspects at Kopanong Shopping Centre. He screamed and then the members of the community started to assault the suspects. The police rescued them and they will be appearing at the Tembisa Magistrate’s Court.”
