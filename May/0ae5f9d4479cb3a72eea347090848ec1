The case of two men accused of kidnapping an Mthatha businessman has been postponed to the 7th of June in the Libode Magistrate’s Court in the Eastern Cape. One Zimbabwean national and a man from Libode were arrested over a week ago for allegedly kidnapping a 24-year-old Mthatha businessman and demanding a ransom of R1-million from his family. The victim was rescued by police after being locked and allegedly tortured at Tyumbu village outside Mthatha. A Zimbabwean man died during a shootout with the police. Scores of locals and business fraternity picketed outside the court, calling for denial of bail. Business woman Thembi Nkubungu says they have submitted a petition. “As they have remanded the case up until 7 June, we have submitted a petition to the magistrate. He should note that foreign nationals do not stand trials and also this kidnapping is undermining the democracy of our beautiful land,” says Nkubungu.
