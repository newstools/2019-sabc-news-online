The African National Congress (ANC) former election head in the Western Cape, Ebrahim Rasool, says the party is being wrecked by in-fighting between two factions. There’s also disagreement over a recent one million rand donation made by businessman Iqbal Surve and confusion about who is the legitimate party spokesperson in the province. ANC member Lionel Adendorf insists he is the official spokesperson while another member Dennis Cruywagen says the party does not recognise Adendorf. Rasool says these problems must be rooted out in order for the ANC to progress in the Western Cape. “I fear that it may be a fight between those who want the ANC to be unequivocally on a renewal path and those who may have tied up their fortunes with people who can unfortunately be perceived as the detractors of President Cyril Ramaphosa nationally. So maybe, I think if the ANC is going to renew it has to sort out precisely those type of things,” says Rasool.
