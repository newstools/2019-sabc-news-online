African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, has again shot down reports that there’s tension between him and party president Cyril Ramaphosa. Magashule was speaking at a function to remember the life and times of the late anti-apartheid stalwart, Walter Sisulu, at the iconic Wesleyan Church in Waaihoek in Bloemfontein, where the ANC was founded in 1912. Some analysts have suggested that Ramaphosa helped the ANC to win the recent national and provincial elections. However, Magashule is adamant that Ramaphosa cannot take credit for the party’s win, saying it was achieved through undivided support. “We won these elections because we all worked together. But we agree that the face of the campaign was Cyril Ramaphosa,” says Magashule. Magashule has also lambasted disgruntled party members who often resort to courts to resolve political differences,  adding that the ANC is far from being shaken by internal strife. “Those who are not satisfied, who don’t believe in the collective. Those who don’t believe in the highest decision-making body, the national executive committee has taken a decision – but they continue to fight against the ANC. They think they are fighting the individuals whereas they forgot that they pledged to be members, loyal members of the ANC.”
