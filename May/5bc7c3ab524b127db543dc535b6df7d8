Charismatic preacher and self-proclaimed prophet Sheperd Bushiri and his wife Mary’s court case has been postponed to August 29. The two were due in the Pretoria Commercial Crime Court on Friday, but their case was moved forward due to security concerns. It was heard on Tuesday at the state’s behest. Hawks spokesperson, Hangwani Mulaudzi says the move was to avoid commotion outside the court, especially since the country was still preparing for the general elections which were held on Wednesday. Bushiri’s previous court appearances have been chaotic, with throngs of his supporters flocking to court demanding his release. The couple faces charges of fraud, money laundering and the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, dating back to 2015. The pair’s bail conditions include that they resident between Gauteng and the North West. Watch video of Bushiri’s February court appearance:
