More than 300 traditional initiation schools have been given a green light to operate in Limpopo. The initiation season will start on Friday next week. Chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Malesela Dikgale believes that they’ll operate death-free initiation schools. “We will be having 327 initiation schools running in the province because we got 393 applications and 327 were accepted and some were rejected. The season will start on the 7th of June and will end on the 14th of July and we hope everyone will be within the boundaries of the law. We don’t think there will be someone who will be outside boundaries because those who will be outside will be out of order,” says Dikgale. Police Spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says they are ready to deal with those who will contravene circumcision act by operating illegal schools. “As the police, we are ready for this particular period. We hope this time around there will be a complete compliance of the law and we will not be forced to close any of the schools. We did have some contraventions of the circumcision school act and police have to open case dockets where the investigation led to those owners of the initiation schools paying an admission of guilty,” says Mojapelo.
