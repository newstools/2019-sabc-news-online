The Zondo Commission, probing allegations of state capture, will resume on Thursday in Parktown, Johannesburg. Transnet Executive Manager for Governance, Peter Stephen Volmink, is expected to take the stand. His testimony follows that of the parastatal’s board chairperson, Popo Molefe. On Tuesday, Molefe told the inquiry that Transnet lost about R16-billion in the acquisition of over 1 000 locomotives due to flawed procurement processes. He says the board is pursuing civil action against service providers and former Transnet executives, Brian Molefe, Siyabonga Gama and Anoj Singh. The Transnet chair described the three as the architects and facilitators of state capture at the company. Molefe claims they turned a blind eye to the siphoning of state funds. They allegedly approved irregular contracts, which would ultimately benefits their preferred companies. Regiments and Trillian are among service providers under probe. Watch Popo Molefe’s testimony:
