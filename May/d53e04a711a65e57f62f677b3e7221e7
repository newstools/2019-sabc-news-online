The Free State department of health says there is no human affected by swine flu in the province. The disease can be transmitted to humans but this is very rare. Spokesperson Mondli Mvambi says following rumours of swine flu outbreak making rounds, the department has checked laboratories. Mvambi says there is no swine flu circulating among humans at this stage, noting that people are however contracting normal flu at this time of year which in most cases is not fatal. Mvambi has urged people who suspect someone is suffering from swine flu to report the matter to authorities.
