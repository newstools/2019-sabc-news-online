The South African Social Security Agency’s (SASSA) manager in the Eastern Cape, Nombulelo Ngubane, has urged beneficiaries to go to their paypoints to collect their grants on Monday. She says pay points in all six district municipalities, the OR Tambo, Alfred Nzo, Amathole, Buffalo city, Joe Gqabi and Chris Hani will be operational. “Communities had voiced their unhappiness with the decision. The decision was made because on the 6th May our voters will have to go for special votes in our communities and we did not want to inconvenience our beneficiaries when they were supposed to go out and vote,” says Ngubane.
