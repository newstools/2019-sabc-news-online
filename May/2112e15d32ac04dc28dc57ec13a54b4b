A branch chairperson of the ANC Youth League in the eThekwini region, Dumisani Moyo, has been gunned down outside his home at eNtshongweni, west of Durban. The regional spokesperson of the Youth League, Thulisa Ndlela, says unknown people shot Moyo when he was being dropped off at home. Moyo and other ANC members had just returned from a visit to a bereaved family. Members of his family were inside the house during the shooting. The ANC Youth League has expressed concern about the killing and called on its members to exercise restraint while police investigate the case. More than 20 ANC leaders have been killed in KwaZulu-Natal in just two years.
