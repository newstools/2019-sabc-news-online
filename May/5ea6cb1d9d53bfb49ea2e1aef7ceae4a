A twenty-seven-year old acid attack survivor from Delpoortshoop in the Northern Cape is seeking justice. Portia Pitso has been left with scars on her body and face after her former lover allegedly poured acid over her earlier this year. She says police are failing her. Pitso’s life changed irrevocably from a vibrant and confident young mother to a scarred victim with partial vision in early March. “This thing that has happened to me is so bad. I can’t accept it. He was very cruel, he is dangerous. He is a dangerous man.” The mother of two says she has been receiving threatening calls from her former lover, who is still on the run. She describes him as a jealous, obsessed person who did not want their relationship to end. “He has been hurting me so much; I just want him to be arrested because now I don’t feel safe.” The alleged perpetrator owns a tuck shop in the area. The Delpoortshoop community is rallying behind the victim. However, police are yet to make headway with the case. “We are still pursuing the suspect, we are in his trail. The investigation is still continuing at this stage. The suspect is not yet arrested. However, we are requesting any person with information to assist us, to communicate that information with the nearest police station,” says Northern Cape police spokesperson Olebogeng Tawana. Pitso was hospitalised for weeks following the incident. She hopes to undergo eye surgery soon to restore her sight. Click below for more on the story:
