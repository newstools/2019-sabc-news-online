The Department of Agriculture has banned imports of wool and livestock from Lesotho. The department says this is due to reports of three anthrax outbreaks which are believed to have claimed 24 cattle this month alone. The Department’s Zweli Silangwe says they are in contact with Lesotho. “South Africa imports red meat from Lesotho, what we have done is we are talking to business in South Africa or any other person not to take meat from Lesotho. So the meat from Lesotho, in particular red meat, is prohibited from entering the borders of South Africa,” says Silangwe.
