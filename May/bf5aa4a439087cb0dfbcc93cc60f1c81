The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Federal Executive says the party will work on regaining its support for the 2021 local government elections. FedEx briefed the media in Bruma, east of Johannesburg, were Federal Executive members met earlier on Monday. The Federal Executive has taken collective responsibility for the loss of support in last week’s national and provincial elections. It says party leader, Mmusi Maimane is not to blame for the dip in electoral support. The DA lost support at national and provincial level – sparking some comments on social media that Maimane should be removed as leader.  Chairperson of the DA, James Selfie says the party will go back to the drawing board after its support declined in the national ballot. The DA has lost its position as official opposition in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the North West. The meeting also discussed the governance of the Western Cape in which the DA won back majority support and the deployment of party officials to the sixth Parliament. FedEx chairperson, Athol Trollip, says they will continue backing Maimane as the party’s leader. Trollip says the party will now work on regaining support for the 2021 local government elections.
