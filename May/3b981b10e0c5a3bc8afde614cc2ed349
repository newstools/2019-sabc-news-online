Statistics South Africa has revealed that the annual consumer price inflation dropped to 4.4% in April, from 4.5% in March 2019. Economists say the lower inflation figure is a welcomed surprised and an indication of a controlled inflation environment. Stats SA says the only negative contribution to CPI was the increased fuel price increase. An Economist at NKC Economists Elize Kruger says, “So clearly today we see that inflation remains well under control, also core inflation came in at only 4,1% that is down from 4, and 4% from the previous months. We see that there’s very little demand side on pricing.  The main reason in terms of the monthly growth rate of 0,6 in April were indeed higher fuel prices.” Click related video below:
