A group of medical health practitioners are marching to the offices of Discovery Health Group in Sandton north of Johannesburg on Friday. The group, which includes Black and Indian health practitioners, have accused some medical aid schemes of racial profiling them among other discriminatory practices. They’ve gathered in Sandton and are marching to Discovery where they are expected to hand over a memorandum of demands. Health practitioner Nomaefesi Gatsheni says this discriminatory practice is impacting heavily on some of the members. “Most of our colleagues are sick. Our colleagues are taking anti-depressants because they can’t cope. Our colleagues cannot afford anything. Their houses have been taken and they’ve lost their cars. So we want this to stop by the end of today,” adds Gatsheni.
