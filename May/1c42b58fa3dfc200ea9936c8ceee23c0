Former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela says it’s not fair for some political parties to keep calling for the current public protector to vacate office. This follows the DA’s call to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise to facilitate a process that will see Busisiwe Mkhwebane removed. Madonsela says people should not be judged solely on the basis of the mistakes they’ve made “People should understand that people may make mistakes while in office but some excel in some ways. And I wouldn’t say it’s proper to keep calling for people to vacate office when they make mistakes. If of course they’ve done anything more than making mistakes, then that would make sense.” Earlier, Mkhwebane said she was considering her legal options, including a possible approach to the Constitutional Court, following the Pretoria High Court’s decision to set aside her report into the Estina Dairy Farm Project at Vrede in the Free State. The court ruled Mkhwebane failed to do her job with due diligence and also failed to properly investigate those implicated in the R200 million Vrede dairy farm scandal. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and others had approached the Public Protector to probe the alleged involvement of then Free State Premier Ace Magashule and others in the matter.
