South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) members in KwaZulu-Natal have returned to work after a two-week strike. Talks to resolve the standoff are however ongoing. Samwu Provincial Secretary, Jaycee Ncanana, says the Ethekwini Municipality and the union had no choice but to come to a compromise. “I can proudly say workers are back at work just because of that agreement we signed on the 7th of May. There were mixed feelings, but the bottom line is that we couldn’t keep that kind of situation forever we had to change our minds and attitudes so that we come closer to each other.” Last week, striking workers brought Durban to a standstill. They threw rubbish bins on the streets as they demanded the resumption of pay grade adjustment process for Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans working in the city’s water department.
