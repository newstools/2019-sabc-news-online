Tuesday’s planned announcement of the new Gauteng executive council has been now been postponed. This after Gauteng Premier David Makhura was scheduled to announce his new executive council in Parktown north of Johannesburg later on Tuesday. Gauteng government spokesperson Thabo Masebe says the Premier is still consulting the African National Congress (ANC) on who to appoint as MEC’s. Twitter is already abuzz with people calling for former Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi to be elected Education Minister.  It’s unclear whether this is the reason why Makhura’s announcement on his executive council has been delayed. “I don’t want to talk about any individual.  All I can say now is that the Premier is still finalising consultation,” adds Masebe. Six former Gauteng MEC’s – Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, Ismail Vadi, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza, Barbra Creecy and Uhuru Moiloa could be left out of the new Gauteng executive council. Creecy is now a Member of Parliament and Nkosi-Malobane is chair of chairs in the legislature while the rest were not sworn-in as MPL’s.
