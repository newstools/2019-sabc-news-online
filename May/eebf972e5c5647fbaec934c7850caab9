The EFF has slammed the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation for what it calls,- mobilising society to discredit the Public Protector because of her findings against former Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The EFF also says the question raised about the timing of the release of the Public Protector’s report into Gordhan is irrelevant. The Kathratha Foundation joined other civil society groups in supporting the recall of Busisiwe Mkhwebane. This comes after Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of improper conduct in the decision he made as Finance Minister to grant former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay early retirement with full benefits. She has recommended that President Cyril Ramphosa takes disciplinary steps against Gordhan. EFF Spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says he must be held accountable for his maladministration. “And it is very shameful for the Kathrada Foundation to be mobilising civil society to discredit the Public Protector merely because Pravin Gordhan has been found guilty of maladministration by the Public Protector. It is reactionary. It doesn’t even represent Ahmed Kathrada and what he stood for. Secondly the timing is out of the question. The question is, has the Public Protector done anything outside her powers? The answer is an absolute no. Pravin Gordhan must be held accountable for what he did. The story ends there.” See infographic below for Mkhwebane’s findings and remedial action on Pravin Gordhan:
