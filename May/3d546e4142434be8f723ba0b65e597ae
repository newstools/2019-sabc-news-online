The South African Medical Association (SAMA) says nobody has come forward yet to officially make allegations against medical schemes. Media reports during the week prompted the Council for Medical Schemes to launch an investigation. It relates to black medical practitioners in the private sector alleging that medical aid schemes do not pay them on the basis of racial profiling. The association’s chairperson, Dr Angelique Coetzee says, “We are against any form of racial profiling of any doctor, regardless of whether they are working in private or public sector. We will respond to the allegations regarding the medical schemes profiling doctors on grounds of race after the Council of Medical Schemes has done their investigation and it’s been proven. But, up until today, I don’t have any proof that race is being used.”  Watch related video below for more on the story:
