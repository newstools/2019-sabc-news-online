The Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State capture is expected to continue to hear testimony of Tshiamo Sedumedi on behalf of MNS attorneys when proceedings resume in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. The Commission will also hear Transnet related testimony from Actuarial Scientist, Alister Chabi. On Tuesday, Sedumedi said that China South Rail (CSR) enjoyed a special relationship with Transnet officials which saw CSR clinching billions in business from Transnet through the locomotive transactions. He said email correspondence between former Transnet Procurement Executive, Gary Pita and China South Rail (CSR) officials indicated that former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe, had met with CSR officials before the tender process of the 95-locomotives had commenced. Sedumedi says Molefe misled the Board in his reasons for confining China South Rail as the preferred bidder for the 100-locomotives tender worth R3.8 billion. He says Molefeâ€™s memorandum to the board recommended for deviation from an open tender process to directly award the tender to China South Rail. Sedumedi says this was not in line with the recommendation by management three months earlier cautioning against deviations, which are also known as confinements.
