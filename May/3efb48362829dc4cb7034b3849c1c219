KwaZulu-Natal will on Thursday observe a provincial day of prayer and mourning for the victims of floods that caused havoc in the province last week. The storm claimed seventy lives and left more than one thousand four hundred homeless in the province. President Cyril Ramaphosa has instructed that the national flag fly at half-mast across the country from today until the May 7. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu is expected to address the official event at Durban’s Curries Fountain. All KwaZulu-Natal residents are also being asked to observe a minute of silence at midday today. The cost of the damage is estimated at R1.1 billion. Click below for related video….
