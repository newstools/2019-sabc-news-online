EFF leader Julius Malema has again vowed that he will not return to the ANC. Malema was speaking at the funeral of his grandmother, Koko Sarah Malema in Seshego, Limpopo on Saturday. She died last Saturday, aged 90. The latest call for Malema to return to the ruling party was made by ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule during his campaign at Ikageng township, in Tlokwe, North West last month that he must come back with his supporters. Malema spoke fondly of his grandmother and her unwavering support for his political career. He says: “I want to say in front of her coffin, in her presence that I will never go back to the ANC.” “If EFF fails – I’ll go teach, or I’ll become a lawyer as I’m doing my masters now. I can also be a farmer, I love farming. I will never go back to the ANC.” “We will dig your daughter’s grave and come and bury her in front of your gate, that’s what the ANC said to me, that’s what the ANC said to my grandmother. Gwede Mantashe was called, he said there is nothing the ANC can do about those things,” he said. Related video below
