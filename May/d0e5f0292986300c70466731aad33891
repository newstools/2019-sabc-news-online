The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) has accused Patricia de Lille of selling out the coloured vote by joining the administration of President Cyril Ramaphosa. De Lille is the new Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure and she has been sworn-in by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng in Pretoria on Thursday. FFPlus member in the Western Cape Legislature, Peter Marais says De Lille has broken the trust of her voters by accepting the Cabinet position. Marais says De Lille has let down the coloured voters who wanted a political home where they, as a minority, will be given a voice. In addition Marais says land expropriation without compensation will be driven by De Lilleâ€™s department, and thus minorities will be pushed aside. Marais says they will also come second when it comes to job creation, language and mother-tongue education. Former FFPlus leader Pieter Mulder had served as a Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries under the administration of former President Jacob Zuma from 2009 until 2014.
