 Leadership expert Mazwe Majola says President Cyril Ramaphosa faces immense pressure as he begins his new term as leader of the country. Ramaphosa took his oath of office at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria. In his address to the nation, he vowed to work to end poverty and acknowledged the challenges faced by South Africans. Majola elaborates on the challenges Ramaphosa faces as he aims to move the country forward. “I believe that Ramaphosa is facing so much pressure. Pressure number one is coming from himself as a leader to deliver but also there is a pressure from his own party you know about the factions.  So he always has to watch his back whatever he does to make sure that he takes decisions but at the same time keeping the party happy.” “There is a pressure from opposition as well, they will be hammering on him. Another pressure is from the whole country, they want to see that unemployment is dealt with, poverty is dealt with. The last pressure is from the international world.” Click video below:
