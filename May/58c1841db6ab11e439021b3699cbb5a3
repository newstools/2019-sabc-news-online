Former Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan, has filed court papers in the High Court in Pretoria to set aside the report by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of improper conduct in the decision he made during his term as Minister of Finance to grant former South African Revenue Services (SARS) deputy commissioner, Ivan Pillay, early retirement with full benefits. Mkhwebane has recommended that President Cyril Ramphosa take disciplinary steps against Gordhan. Gordhan’s lawyer, Tebogo Malatji, explains the details of their complaint: “Firstly, we say did she exercise her discretion rightly under the Public Protector Act to entertain the complaint and we say not because she is yet to set out what those special circumstances are to look into a complaint which is as old as 2010. Our second complaint is she has taken this decision in haste. We submitted a response to a notice she had issued to us on Wednesday and by Friday she’d made a decision. We doubt very much that she has applied herself to the representations that we have made.” READ COURT PAPERS BELOW:  Watch a related video below:
