Taiwanese electronics company, Pegatron, has signed a letter of intent stating it intends to invest 695 million to $1 billion in an Indonesian factory to produce chips for Apple smartphones, the Indonesian Deputy Industry Minister said on Tuesday. Pegatron plans to produce the chips in partnership with Indonesian electronics company PT Sat Nusapersada, Deputy Minister Warsito Ignatius told Reuters. “The factory might also be used to produce MacBook components as well, but it would not be in the short term,” Ignatius said.
