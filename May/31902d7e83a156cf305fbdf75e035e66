The High Court in Pretoria has declared the Public Protectorâ€™s report on the controversial Vrede Dairy Farm project, unconstitutional and invalid and has set it aside. The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (CASAC) had approached the court to set aside the report which was released by Busisiwe Mkhwebane, accusing her of protecting politicians such as ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, during her investigation. CASAC says Mkhwebane altered the remedial action contained in the draft report by her predecessor Thuli Madonsela. CASAC had petitioned the court to have Mkhwebane personally pay its legal fees should the court rule in their favour. Earlier, CASAC Executive Secretary Lawson Naidoo says law enforcement and the new NDPP Shamila Batohi should be tasked with bringing those involved to book. Related video click below:
