ANC National Working Committee member and Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane will also not be sworn into the National Assembly on Wednesday. Earlier it was announced that Deputy President David Mabuza has asked for his swearing in to be postponed until allegations against him have been dealt within the party’s Integrity Commission. ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina has confirmed that the two will not be sworn in. Majodina says the postponement of Mokonyane’s swearing in was due to cultural reasons. “Comrade Mokonyane is grieving. At the moment there are certain rituals and traditional practices that she is supposed to undertake.” “I have been informed that she will not be in today, but the arrangement will be made for a swearing in later,” adds Majodina.
