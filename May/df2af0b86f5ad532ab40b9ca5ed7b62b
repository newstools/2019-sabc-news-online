Former Tshwane Mayor Kgosientsho Ramokgopa says his new role as Gauteng Economic Development and Agriculture MEC is a daunting task but he is up for the challenge. He’s among the 10 MEC’s announced by Premier David Makhura in a statement on Wednesday. Four of the 10 MEC’s Panyaza Lesufi, Lebohang Maile, Faith Mazibuko and Jacob Mamabolo have been brought back albeit in different portfolios. Ramokgopa says as the sixth administration, they are aware of the level of impatience especially among the youth to provide services and create jobs. “The task is daunting given that this is about the seven largest economy on the continent. And we are about a third, R1.3 trillion economy in the country. So a third of the country’s economy is located here. So if you are to make a significant dent on issues of unemployment, inequality, poverty, improving the skills and getting the economy going I guess Gauteng has got a disproportionate amount of responsibility to do that so we looking forward to the task,” says Ramokgopa.
