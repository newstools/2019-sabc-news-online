Police in KwaZulu-Natal are searching for a man who gunned down three family members in Mpembeni near Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal’s north coast. Among those dead is a two-year-old child. The deceased cannot be named until the rest of the family is notified of the incident. THE FOLLOWING STORY CONTAINS GRAPHIC DETAILS. The incident happened around 8pm on Friday night. Police say an unknown person stormed a house and fired at the occupants. Three died immediately and one escaped with multiple gun wounds. The suspect then torched the house with the bodies inside. Traditional leader Mavuka Ngwenya says that they are shocked by the incident. “This incident has left us in shock. We are not sure what happened. We have incidents where they just burn houses and kill even children.” The area is notorious for killings. 20 people have been attacked and killed in the last two years. Three men were arrested in connection with the killings. Two were denied bail and one turned state witness. Ward Councillor, Jabu Hadebe, says that the area has known no peace since 2018. “Since 2018, we have never had peace in this ward. Our male children are being targeted, the motive is unknown. But we do have a suspicion these killings started when there was a committee of contractors appointed in the RBM. We are not sure if this incident is related.” Police are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder.
