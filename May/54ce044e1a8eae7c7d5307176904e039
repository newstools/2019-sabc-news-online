The Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture is expected to hear the testimony of Thobani Mnyandu of MNS Attorneys, when proceedings resume in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday. On Wednesday, MNS Attorneysâ€™ Tshiamo Sedumedi said former Transnet Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Molefe wrongfully requested the Transnet board to approve a R2.7 billion provision for batch pricing in the acquisition of the 1064 locomotives. Sedumedi said that the R16 billion increase in the estimated total cost of the 1064 locomotives was irregularly approved by the Transnet Board when it should have been referred to the Public Enterprises Ministry for approval. He said that the memorandum presented by Molefe to the Board, requesting an increase of the locomotives acquisition, should have been referred to the Minister because it acceded the R 3.9 billion approval threshold.
