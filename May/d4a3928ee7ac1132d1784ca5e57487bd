Former President Thabo Mbeki will lead a group of Commonwealth observers for 2019 tripartite elections in Malawi. Voters will go to the polls on the 21 of May to elect a President as well as members of the National Assembly and Local government Councillors. The group includes politicians, diplomats and experts in law, human rights, gender and election administration from across the Commonwealth. The observer group will examine preparations for the elections, before observing the voting process, vote-counting procedures and the announcement of results. President Peter Mutharika, who has been in power since 2014, will be seeking another term. He faces stiff opposition from his former deputy Saulos Chilima. The elections come weeks after a cyclone killed several people in the country in March. The Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) said it will set up satellite polling stations to allow Internally Displaced Persons in camps to vote.
