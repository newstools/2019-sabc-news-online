Newly elected KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the ruling party will not use its numbers in the provincial legislature to suppress the views of other parties. Zikalala was speaking during his inauguration as Premier of the province in Pietermaritzburg. His inauguration was also attended by former President Jacob Zuma and two former Premiers, Ben Ngubane and Sbu Ndebele.  Zikalala says that they will not disregard any views or organisations on the basis of political affiliation. “We are tolerant to a multiplicity of views we shall never disregard any view from any individual or organisation on the basis of political affiliation or status in life. We are the government that is going to serve all the people of KZN. To the speaker and to all opposition parties, we commit that the provincial government will always be accountable irrespective of the party that want us to account. Not to use our majority as the ANC to suppress and undermine accountability.” The guess if over as who will be in Zikalala’s provincial cabinet. – Education MEC is KwaZi Mshengu – Public Works and Human Settlements is Peggy Nkonyeni – Economic Development and Tourism is Nomusa Dube-Ncube – Health is Nomagugu Smelane-Zulu – Transport and Community Safety MEC is Mxolisi Kaunda –  Agriculture and Rural Development MEC is Bongi Sthole-Moloi. -Sports and Arts and Culture MEC is Hlengiwe Mavimbela. – Social Development MEC is Nonhlanhla Khoza – Finance is Ravi Pillay.
