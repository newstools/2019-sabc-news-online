The Commission for Gender Equality has summoned the South African Police Service (SAPS) management to appear before it on Thursday morning over the policeâ€™s handling of gender-based related cases. The commission is concerned by what it terms lengthy delays by police to investigate such cases including sexual harassment and gender discrimination. It says the SAPS is unresponsive and takes too long to furnish it with information needed to finalise its own investigations. The commission says it was forced to serve the SAPS with a notice to appear before it despite agreements reached with the police during its previous engagements.
