The class-action land claims case between the representatives of more than 3 000 District Six claimants and the government will resume in the High Court in Cape Town on Friday. Rural Development Minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, is expected to appear before the court. In April, the court ruled that she comes before court to explain why she had not complied with an order regarding the District six claimants. The District Six Working Committee had filed a contempt of court motion against Nkoana-Mashabane after government missed a deadline to submit a plan on how it plans to settle the restitution claim of the community. That ruling was made in November 2018 and the Rural Development Minister had blamed government’s legal representatives for the delay to comply. She’s expressed commitment to finding a lasting solution to the saga. WATCH
