The recent killing of African National Congress (ANC) activist Martin Sithole has left the Newcastle community in northern KwaZulu-Natal shocked. Sithole and his friend, Buthanani Shange, were ambushed by unknown men, who shot and killed them at the weekend. The families of the victims have called on police to work around the clock to effect arrests. Sithole’s relative Fikile Ndima says they will only find closure after the police have arrested those responsible for the crime. “We are still in shock and disbelief that Martin is no more, he loved his family and his community at large, he left his young children, it is so sad. We urge police to arrest those responsible so we can also know the motive for his killing.” Meanwhile, Sithole’s friend Mqapheleni Ngcobo says Sithole spoke out against those who were abusing political power. “He loved the ANC and was very active within the party. At some stage he was a branch Treasurer. Martin was outspoken and used to call into order those abusing the name of the ANC to fight their personal battles.” DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5030455-MOERANE-COMMISSION-of-INQUIRY-REPORT.js", {
