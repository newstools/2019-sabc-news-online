African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general, Ace Magashule has called on those who will be representing the party in Parliament and provincial legislatures to put the interests of the masses at heart. Magashule was speaking on Saturday at an ANC struggle stalwart Walter Sisulu’s commemorative function at the iconic Wesleyan Church, Waaihoek, in Bloemfontein where the ANC was founded in 1912.  Magashule says it’s important for public representatives to emulate Sisulu and his peers who did not betray the trust of the masses. “Black people must participate in the mainstream of the economy and that struggle is going to continue and I hope those who are going into parliament, those who are getting into government will remember where we come from and will never forget our roots. The likes of Walter Sisulu inspired and agitated us and activated us to be where we are so the struggle continues,” says Magashule.  Watch the LiveStream:
