The Provincial Executive Committee of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says it has decided to relieve its spokesperson, Lionel Adendorf of his duties as political head of communications. The party says all communications will come from the office of the provincial Secretary. “It was a unanimous decision taken, comrade Lionel has been informed by now. I think about that party decision and the ANC has also resolved that as a tradition in the ANC that communication in the Western Cape should come from the office of Provincial Secretary, Faiez Jacobs. All communications will come from him,” says Dennis Cruywagen who is the ANC Spokesperson.
