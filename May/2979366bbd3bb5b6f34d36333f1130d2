The office of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has hit back at the Democratic Alliance (DA) for its call for her removal, describing it of being disingenuous. On Thursday the DA requested the newly elected Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise to begin an investigation into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. This after the latest judgment by the High Court in Pretoria which has set aside the findings of the Public Protector on the Vrede Dairy farm project. Mkhwebane says the DA seems to be speaking in forked tongues when it comes to its attitude towards the Public Protector. Mkhwebane’s spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says, “It is also the same party that has led an ill-fated attempt to have the fifth parliament to institute a similar process. So from where we stand this is the party that speaks from both sides of the mouth, because today they will be calling for the Public Protector’s removal and the next day-their leader will be here asking the Public Protector to investigate the allegations of breach of the executive codes by the President and regularly visits us for progress report. So it’s confusing. Its either you trust us you don’t.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
