Judgment has been reserved in the Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti‘s application to block Public Protector’s adverse report against him. Nkwinti approached the High Court saying he was refused an extension to respond to allegations against him. The allegations relate to the purchase of a Limpopo farm in 2011. Nkwinti was supposed to have explained his role in the farm purchase process. The Public Protector argues that Nkwinti’s request amounted to an attempt to dictate to the Public Protector’s office. The parties will be informed about the decision once the judge has applied his mind. The Public Protector’s office was expected to release a report this Monday afternoon. In the interim report, Nkwinti has been found to have violated the Executive Ethics code. Nkwinti is arguing that he was never granted an opportunity to engage with the Public Protector.
