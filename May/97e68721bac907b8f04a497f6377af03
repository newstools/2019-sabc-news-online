Police Minister Bheki Cele has described as commendable the manner in which police promptly arrested suspects of electoral fraud. He was briefing the media in Pretoria. Cele says more than 200 arrests were made in connection with attempts to multiple voting and crime in general during the sixth national elections last week.  “In relation to alleged multiple voting, a total of 8 cases and 24 arrests were noted. In terms of crime prevention, the number of cases registered were 188 in total. 203 suspects were arrested, 53 cases are currently in court, 99 cases are under investigation and 9 cases are currently with senior public prosecutor for decision,” says Cele. Security Cluster ministers have thanked South Africans for their active citizenship and a peaceful election. Nine million registered voters failed to cast their ballots at the 6th national election since democracy. A record 48 political parties contested Wednesday’s polls. Although preceded by several violent protests in various areas, the Security Cluster says it is happy with how citizens conducted themselves during the elections. “Many of the voters exercised tolerance and patience as they waited in long queues to exercise their democratic right to vote. As a country, we have displayed that our democracy is indeed vibrant and allows everyone irrespective of race, colour, gender or religion to make their voice heard through voting,” Cele adds. The Cluster also fleshed out details on a few concerns.  The Minister of Police explains that, “Although incidents were reported in Vuwani during the election with voting stations being closed and then reopened after IEC officials were given assurances that they would be protected, the electoral process was able to proceed.” Meanwhile, government has congratulated the IEC for a job well done in administering the elections.
It also commended the IEC for the way in which it handled disputes and other issues.
