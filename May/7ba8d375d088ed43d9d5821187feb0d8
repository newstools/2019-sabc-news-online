Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has warned President Cyril Ramaphosa not to include Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan in his new Cabinet. Malema says although he can’t tell the President who he can and can’t include in his Cabinet, they will be watching him. On Friday, the EFF leader welcomed Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s finding that Gordhan was wrong to authorise the early retirement for then South African Revenue Service (SARS) deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. Malema says if Ramaphosa ignores Mkhwebana’s findings against the Minister, the President will find the red berets waiting for him in Parliament. Malema has also called on the President to give people land as he has promised during the elections.
