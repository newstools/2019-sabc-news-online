Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, is among those who are at the Pietermaritzburg High Court to support him. The court is expected to hear Zuma’s application for permanent stay of prosecution in the corruption case against him related to the 1999 multi-billion rand arms deal. Security inside and outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court has been beefed up as Zuma is expected to appear. Scores of African National Congress supporters dressed in their regalia have started gathering outside court to show their support. A number of ANC provincial leaders are expected to attend the court proceedings. Duduzane Zuma arrived in court with a heavy security entourage.
