Supporters of the late former ANC Youth League secretary-general, Sindiso Magaqa, say they still want the truth behind his murder. Magaqa was gunned down two years ago while coming from a branch meeting at uMzimkhulu Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. Two female councillors, Nontsikelelo Mafa and Jabulile Msiya, who were with Magaqa on that day, were wounded. Four people, including two police officers, were arrested in connection with the murder. The others were Harry Gwala district municipality mayor, Mluleki Ndobe, and uMzimkhulu municipal manager, Zweliphansi Skhosana. Charges were dropped against them due to insufficient evidence. However, Magaqa’s supporters are adamant that they still need answers. “What we want is justice. All the people who committed this murder must be arrested so that is must be a lesson to others,” says one supporter. Another supporter says: “It’s useless to take the people into jail and after a year they are out.” Watch the video below for related news:
