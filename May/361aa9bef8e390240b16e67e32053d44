Transnet board chairperson Popo Molefe is on Monday expected to take the stand before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Transnet’s new board was appointed in May last year. Under Molefe it has been trying to stabilise the organisation and root out corruption. Molefe will be followed by the new acting group chief executive Mohammed Mahomedy and governance executive Peter Volmink. The state-owned company replaced its acting chief executive Tau Morwe recently. This after Molefe received information that Morwe was implicated in the alleged flouting of procurement procedures. In a statement, Volmink said that Morwe motivated that telecoms company Neotel be given a R4.9 billion contract to upgrade the CCTV systems at the country’s ports, without a competitive bidding process.
