Political analyst Professor Leseba Tefo says chances of David Mabuza being the deputy president again are very high. Tefo’s comments come as President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to announce his new cabinet on Monday. A cloud hangs over Mabuza following allegations of corruption levelled against him in his capacity as the former premier of Mpumalanga. Professor Tefo says Mabuza has been cleared by the Public Protector that the allegations leveled against him have not been proven in court. “What David Mabuza did is to portray himself as a voice of reason that is responsive to the call of the ANC that, when you are implicated in malice and other things please step aside address those issues.” “If today he is acquitted again once more or they say there’s nothing we can do about this matter and then he’s cleared. He will come out smelling like a rose more strengthened because now people will say that he is the example that is worthy of emulation.” Related video click below:
