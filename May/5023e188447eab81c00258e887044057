The grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd, Wynand Boshoff, is making his way to the sixth Parliament. Boshoff is leader of the Freedom Front Plus (FFPlus) in the Northern Cape, which managed to win one seat in the provincial legislature post-elections. Verwoerd was an Afrikaner nationalist who is dubbed the architect of apartheid. Boshoff says he is ready to take on the new challenge. “My whole thinking never went beyond the 9th of May; and I really didn’t think about what would happen afterwards. We have a clear goal that we are working for. In a sense that means one is ready as you are; but exactly how things are going to fit together and what I’m going to do is a little bit unknown; and therefore I am excited and cautiously so,” says Boshoff.
