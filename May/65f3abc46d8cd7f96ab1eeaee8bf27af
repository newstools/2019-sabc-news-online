As the Presidential inauguration event kicks off, authorities have warned that the airspace around the Pretoria city centre will be restricted for a radius of 25 nautical miles from 8AM to 4PM. No remotely piloted air systems such as drones will be allowed to operate within the airspace. However, commercial air traffic will not be affected. President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to be sworn-in on Saturday as the head of the sixth administration at the Loftus Versveld stadium in Pretoria. Airspace restrictions are in place due to security concerns over the list of dignitaries attending the event. Meanwhile, Acting Government spokesperson, Director-General, Phumla Williams, says the process of seating attendees is going smoothly. She says, “Some of the heads of states are still arriving. I can confirm the Namibian head of state, Swaziland, Burkina Faso, South Sudan , Angola, Zimbabwe. The list will increase as people arrive. People are coming in, getting their wristbands and are being ushered in. They are going in smoothly.” “Those who came with busses already have their wristbands and they are coming through. It is moving smoothly,” adds Williams.
