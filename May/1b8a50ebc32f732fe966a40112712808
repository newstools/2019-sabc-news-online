The Home Affairs Department is accusing some asylum seekers of taking advantage of the system. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) subpoenaed the department to appear before it on Thursday following complaints from refugees that their applications take too long to process.  The process is supposed to take a minimum of eight months. The department says it will cooperate with the SAHRC in a bid to resolve the issue. It is, however, not impressed with some migrants, whom it accuses of abusing the system. “Those with low skills, because they are unable to apply for any other visa under immigration law, tend to abuse this particular system. But the rate of approval for asylum-seekers is sitting around 6%, almost about 94% of these cases are found to be unfounded claims, therefore the applicants end up being returned to their countries of origin,” says home affairs Acting Director-General Thulani Mavuso.
