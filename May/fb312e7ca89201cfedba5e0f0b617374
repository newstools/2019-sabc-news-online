Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will conduct the swearing in of the ANC deputy president David Mabuza as an ANC Member of Parliament at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthuse in Pretoria this afternoon. Last week, Mabuza requested that his swearing in be postponed to allow him to respond to the ANC’s Integrity Commission report. The report outlined allegations of corruption levelled against him while he was still premier of Mpumalanga. President Cyril Ramaphosa has delayed the announcement of his new cabinet to later this week and this many speculated was to accommodate the ANC deputy president David Mabuza who still needed to clear his name after been red-flagged by the ANC Integrity Commission. Another reason for the delay, at least according to the Presidency, was that Ramaphosa was still consulting with the top brass of the ANC and the alliance partners the SACP, Cosatu and SANCO on who to include in his new executive. Mabuza’s swearing in as an Memeber of Parliamernt, will make him eligible to be roped in as the country’s deputy president.
