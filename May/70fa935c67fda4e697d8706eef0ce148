The former Prime Minster of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn Boshe, will deliver the 10th Thabo Mbeki Africa Day lecture on Friday. The lecture will be under the theme: The National Question, Peace and Democracy. This coincides with the inauguration of President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday. Boshe served in his position from 2012 to 2018. Speaking on the SABC’s Morning Live programme, Boshe says he’s excited about the lecture on Saturday. “The National question in Africa is one of the critical questions we have to address right on, face to face, because sometimes people shy away from this question which exists in many African countries…We need to discuss this issue openly and critically so that its implication on peace and democracy in Africa should be understood in such a way that we pacify and democratise our continent.” The lecture will be held at Z.K. Matthews Great Hall at the Unisa Pretoria Campus. Click link below for a full interview:
