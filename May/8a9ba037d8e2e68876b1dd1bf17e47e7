African National Congress (ANC) Veteran, Mavuso Msimang, says the party would be better off as a smaller organisation that is more committed to service delivery. He says the party should not keep members implicated in corruption for the sake of unity. “If fighting for the soul of the ANC means evil forces wanting to get in, let’s not accommodate them. Then the soul of the ANC is saved,” says Msimang. The party has been reported to have factions within the top leadership of the National Executive Committee. On Tuesday, the party announced the withdrawal of former National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba from the ANC parliamentary list.
