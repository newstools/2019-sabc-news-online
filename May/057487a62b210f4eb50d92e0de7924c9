Hundreds of African National Congress supporters are taking part in a march in Pietermaritzburg in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands in support of former president Jacob Zuma. Zuma who faces 16 charges of corruption, racketeering and fraud is appearing in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. He is applying for a permanent stay of prosecution with a new legal team led by Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane. Traffic has come to a standstill as ANC supporters dressed in the party’s regalia take to the streets of Pietermaritzburg. They are singing struggle songs admiring Zuma’s role in politics. They are also carrying placards written “father of free education” and “we are tired of politics of the stomach”. Religious leaders have also shown their support for Zuma. Various roads leading to court have been closed to traffic.
