African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule has lambasted disgruntled party members who often resort to courts to resolve political differences. He is positive the party will continue to govern for the next 25 years. Speaking at the commemoration of the late anti-apartheid stalwart, Walter Sisulu at the iconic Wesleyan Church in Waaihoek in Bloemfontein where the ANC was founded in 1912, Magashule says the ANC is far from being shaken by internal strifes. “Those who are not satisfied, who don’t believe in the collective, those who don’t believe in the highest decision-making body, the National Executive Committee has taken a decision but they continue to fight against the ANC. They think they are fighting the individuals whereas they forget that they pledged to be members, loyal members of the ANC.” Click below for more on the story:
