The Justice for Thorisho Movement has expressed disappointment about the postponement of the case against 9 teenagers and 2 adults arrested in connection with the killing of Thorisho Themane. The suspects had their cases postponed to the 14 of August for the teenagers while the adults will appear on the 6th of August. Themane was killed by a group of minors aged between 13 and 17 in February. The video of his brutal attack went viral on social media. “As the civil rights movement what we want to see done is exactly that…justice , we just need the proceedings there of as well we gathered by the criminal procedure act and the constitution at large we need to follow those rules. What we condemn as a foundation but a very unfortunate day today once again we are still in the same trap as we were last time. Very sad and unfortunate so we are very disappointed,” says the Movement spokesperson, Kevin Pohotona. Watch related video below:
