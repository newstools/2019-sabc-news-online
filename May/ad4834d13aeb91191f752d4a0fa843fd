The SABC has announced that mop-up operations at its Radio Park headquarters in Johannesburg have been completed, following a diesel leak earlier this week. The SABC says specialised service providers have been working since Wednesday to clean up the diesel spillage, which even affected the lift shafts. The Johannesburg Fire Chief will conduct a final health and safety inspection on Sunday before it is handed back to the SABC. On Wednesday, staff were evacuated after someone detected a diesel leak on one of the back-up generators on the fifteenth floor. Diesel seeped into the lift shaft, and started pooling at the bottom. A heavy diesel smell could be detected even up to the sixth floor of the multi storey building. To prevent a recurrence the generators on the 15th floor will no longer be operational, and the diesel which supplied these generators will no longer be stored on the 16th floor. An internal cleaning company will now take over additional cleaning, which will be completed by the end of Saturday. Following concerns, the oxygen levels at the TV building were tested using hydro-carbon measuring equipment and has been declared non-hazardous. Tests are being conducted on the water supply as an additional precaution.
