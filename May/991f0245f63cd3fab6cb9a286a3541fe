The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) commemorated the United Nations International Peacekeepers Day in Bloemfontein on Wednesday. Families and friends of soldiers who perished in the line of duty laid wreaths to pay homage.  Families of the fallen soldiers who died while serving under the UN peacekeeping mission flag are still grief-stricken. They visited the wall of remembrance in Bloemfontein.  “It eases the pain, yes it’s painful but the more we come, the more we released the pain,” says family member Nozuko Ngaleka. Another family member Nonkoliso Majwete says; “I’m happy that the government did not forget about us but it’s still painful. While the SANDF says it is saddened by the loss, it said the lives of the soldiers were exchanged for a better world. “We feel that void, we are also proud of them because they died serving the nation, during a line of duty to bring peace and stability. Their memories will live forever. They died for a good course,” says SANDF Chief General Solly Shoke. The UN commended South African for its commitment to bringing stability.  “The United Nations really appreciates highly, the contribution of South Africa not only the contribution of the troops but in all that they’re doing in terms of disaster. South Africa has always played a role, ready to support in Tanzania when there was a disaster, South Africa was there so South Africa has been a symbol in stabilizing peace in Africa and we are really appreciating of that,” says UN Resident Coordinator Nardos Bekele. The UN Peacekeepers Day was celebrated under the theme “Protecting civilians, protecting peace.”
