Addressing over 200 business representatives at the conference, Ramaphosa says government will have engage with labour unions. He further states that Eskom was not going to be privatised, but that there was a willingness to partner with the private sector in running its various operations.

I don’t want to hear any excuses from anyone and if you don’t move out of the way and we will get people who can,” adds Ramaphosa.
