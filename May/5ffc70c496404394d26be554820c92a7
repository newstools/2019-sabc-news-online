Condolences are pouring in following the death of former Eastern Cape Transport and Public Works MEC, Thobile Mhlahlo. He died at St Georges Hospital in Port Elizabeth on Friday after a short illness. The African National Congress (ANC) has described him as a humble and dedicated activist, who commanded respect and possessed sincerity. Eastern Cape Legislature deputy speaker Mlibo Qoboshiyane says Mhlahlo played a crucial role in improving the conditions of the transport system in the province. “He has played his role in re-enacting and re activating the railway line between East London and Mthatha. When it comes to train re-introduction and he has played a crucial and high role during the 2010 world cup and also ensuring that transport system in the province of the Eastern Cape is well developed to be world class. All of that is an indication of a principled man and committed man working hard to improve the conditions of the province of the Eastern Cape in particular,” says Qoboshiyane.
