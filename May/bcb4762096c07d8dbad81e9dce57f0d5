Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan guilty of improper conduct for approving an early retirement package for then SARS Deputy Commissioner, Ivan Pillay. Although Pillay took an early retirement, he received full retirement benefits. Gordhan was Finance Minister at the time. Mkhwebane says Pillay was not entitled to an early retirement payout. “Minister Gordhan was not authorised by section 16 2A of the PSA to approve Pillay’s early retirement request with full pension benefits as this section does not discuss any power on the minister to approve early retirement with full pension benefits.” The Public Protector was speaking in Pretoria where she was releasing a number of investigative reports. She has asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to take appropriate disciplinary action against Gordhan for violating the Constitution. Mkhwebane has also asked SARS to recoup the money. The Public Protector meanwhile cleared ANC deputy president David Mabuza of any wrongdoing in the buying of  cars while he was still the Premier of Mpumalanga. Mkhwebane found the office of the Premier to have bought the cars irregularly and cleared Mabuza of having violated the Executive Ethics Code.  Click video below:
