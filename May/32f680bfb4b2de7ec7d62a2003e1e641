An environmental activist, who is being sued by an Australian mining company for defamation, says civil society must stand strong against corporate bullying. Tracey Davies joined other environmentalists, lawyers and civil society organisations on Tuesday in Cape Town at the launch of their campaign called Asina Loyiko. It means Standing Together Against Corporate Bullying. Davies is one of three people being sued for more than R9  million for their criticism of the company’s operations, which include a sand mining project on the Cape West Coast. The first of the court hearings are expected to take place on Wednesday in the High Court in Cape Town. Davies says bullying cannot be tolerated. “I hope that everyone in South Africa is aware of how essential civil society is to upholding our democracy and protecting the rights especially of vulnerable communities and our environment, and that is what these big mining companies have a big impact on. The government simply doesn’t do enough to regulate these companies properly so it’s up to us to speak out and try to raise awareness of what’s happening to our environment and to our people,” says Davies.
