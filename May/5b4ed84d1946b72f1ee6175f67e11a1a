Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Secretary General, Velenkosini Hlabisa, has called on communities, who are angry because of poor service delivery, to vote for his party. Hlabisa was addressing the IFP’s final election rally in Ulundi, in northern KwaZulu-Natal. “If they are tired of voting but if they don’t go and vote and change their vote – it would mean that they are allowing the current ruling party to continue being in government. People of eThekwini, Ndwedwe and Mandeni have been protesting.” IFP leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, meanwhile says his party will take South Africa back to financial health should it be voted into power. He says the IFP has a vision on how to tackle the country’s high unemployment rate, grow the economy and fix the ailing state-owned enterprises. “Ultimately it comes down to you the electorate. We as the leaders of the IFP have waged a campaign for justice and economic justice. We have championed the restoration of integrity to governance. We have told you what is possible and what can be done.”
