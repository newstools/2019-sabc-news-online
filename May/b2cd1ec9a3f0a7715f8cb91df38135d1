The Zondo Commission of inquiry into State Capture is expected to unravel a web of alleged fraud and corruption at Transnet. Evidence leader, Advocate Paul Pretorius, told the Commission that the appointment of Transnet’s former CEO was shrouded in controversy. Advocate Pretorius is placing on record documents relating to Transnet at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry currently underway in Parktown, Johannesburg. Pretorius says the appointment of Brain Molefe as Transnet Chief Executive was predicted in the former Gupta-owned New Age newspaper three months before he was appointed. He says evidence relating to the appointment of Molefe will be heard by the Commission as the appointment was the subject of much controversy. Pretorius says chairperson of the Transnet board’s acquisitions and disposals committee (BADC) Iqbal Sharma recommended Molefe for the Executive position at Transnet. Pretorius also says the Commission will hear evidence relating to tender irregularities regarding the procurement of 1064 locomotives in 2014. The commission has heard that the acquisition of the locomotive escalated from R38 billion rand to over R50 billion. Advocate Pretorius says the Commission will probe allegations of kickbacks paid to front companies belonging to associates of the Gupta family in the purchase of the locomotives. Advocate Mahlape Sello presented forensic reports done by MNS Attorneys which shows that the cost increase was unjustifiable. Transnet Board Chairperson Popo Molefe will take the stand on Tuesday.
