Johannesburg Finance Member of the Mayoral Committee Funzela Ngobeni is expected to table the city’s 2019/2020 budget at the Metro Centre in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Wednesday. Ngobeni is also expected to present the city’s plans, programmes and priorities regarding service delivery, with no delays or objections. Last year, it took three sittings to pass the budget after the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) demanded that the Democratic Alliance-led (DA) administration reduce proposed water and electricity tariffs. African National Congress (ANC) members who were in attendance at the beginning of the sitting were absent when the R59 billion budget was finally passed in 2018 after the DA agreed to reduce the tariffs, siding with the EFF. However, ANC members were still not happy with the amended tariff hikes and accused the DA-led administration of only listening to the EFF at the expense of the majority of Joburg residents. Ngobeni will be hoping that there will be no objections and disruptions when he delivers his budget.
