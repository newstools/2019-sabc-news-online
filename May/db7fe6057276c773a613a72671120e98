The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in KwaZulu-Natal is calling for further investigations into the killing of two Durban Metro Police officers. The two officials were murdered earlier this week in Bhambayi, north of Durban. Three people were arrested for the incident and Cosatu says while it welcomes the swift action by authorities, it is concerned by the police’s inability to put an end to the ongoing killings in the province. The labour federation’s Provincial Secretary, Edwin Mkhize is demanding a probe into the working conditions of police officers that guard public officials. “We are concerned about the recent killing of the two Metro Police officers. We are saying much as the safer and security of those who are councillors, all those in the powers of authority is sacrosanct, but also the condition of those who take care of those councillors and officials. The conditions of work must also be at a level which is acceptable. Now we are not happy as Cosatu that the conditions of work. You find that metro police who are taking care of councillors they are made to linger on their cars for the whole night.” Author- Samkelisiwe Gumede
