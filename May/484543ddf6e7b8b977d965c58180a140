Tributes are pouring in for Labour Court Judge Anton Steenkamp. Steenkamp was bitten by a snake while on holiday in Zambia. The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu has sent her condolensces to Steenkamp’s family and friends. The legal fraternity has joined friends and family to mourn the death of Steenkamp. Steenkamp has been described as a man of integrity who was dedicated to justice. Steenkamp was one of two judges who ran the Labour Court in Cape Town. Colleagues say the entire legal fraternity, including lawyers and labour organisations are shocked and saddened by his death. Those who knew him say Judge Steenkamp died doing what he loved most, touring Africa. Close friends say he was committed to justice and democracy since his student days. Steenkamp worked as a reporter for the anti-apartheid newspaper, the Vrye Weekblad, after completing his LLB degree. He returned to the legal profession when the newspaper closed down. Author and former editor of Vrye Weekblad Max du Preez says: “He was a properly decent human being, the epitome of integrity. I would trust him with anything. He remained a very progressive voice and played a very strong role in the Labour Court and at the same time he was a great family man and adventurer.” Meanwhile, Minister Sisulu has requested the South Africa High Commission in Zambia to provide the necessary support to Steenkamp’s family. They are preparing to repatriate his remains back home. WATCH BELOW:
