The City of Cape Town is encouraging residents to get the flu vaccine at clinics so that they have extra protection against the virus. This year, 14 500 vaccinations are available at City facilities with an additional 26 500 available via facilities operated by the Western Cape Government’s Health Department. The City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Community Services and Health, Zahid Badroodien says preference will be given to vulnerable groups like expectant women and people living with HIV. “We are all susceptible to flu, which is why it is so important to get vaccinated. The vaccine which protects against most flu viruses is safe and the best time to get vaccinated is before the start of winter. The sooner those in vulnerable groups approach their local clinic to get vaccinated, the better.”
