 The South African Christian Ministers Fraternal (Samifra) has joined those calling for the appointment of a woman premier candidate in the North West. On Tuesday the African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) made a similar call. The Commission for Gender Equality on Wednesday said they will be writing to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask him to at least consider a woman. The ANC’s National Executive Committee deliberated on the possible premier candidates who were recommended by their respective provinces and chose two women as premiers but not for the North West. “We are saying we do not want to be involved in the internal affairs of the ANC. But for us as people of the North West we appreciate to be part of the developments within the province hence we are fully supporting the idea but we are not lobbying it. We went out to discuss the woman candidate and there was no name attached to it. For us to bring a woman candidate to us we have 100% endorsed that proposal,” says Samifra Chairperson, Bishop Ntambam. Click below for related video:
