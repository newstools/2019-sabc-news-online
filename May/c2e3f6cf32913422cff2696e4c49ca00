Malawi’s President Peter Mutharika has so far taken 40.44% of votes cast in the May 21 Presidential Election, with 75% of the vote counted, the Electoral Commission said on Thursday. Mutharika, who came to power in 2014, could face a tough battle to hold onto office in Tuesday’s election, after his presidency was damaged by corruption allegations. Lazarus Chakwera, who heads the opposition Malawi Congress Party, has 35.34%, while Deputy President Saulos Chilima has secured 18.35%, the commission told a news conference. Malawi also held parliamentary elections on Tuesday.
