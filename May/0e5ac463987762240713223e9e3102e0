Police Minister Bheki Cele says officers will attend to politically-motivated killings in Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal. An unknown man shot and killed two men including African National Congress (ANC) Emalahleni region activist Martin Sithole last week. There are reports that Sithole had been a state witness in the murder case of Newcastle Mayor Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba. The mayor is accused of killing ANC Youth League Deputy Chair in Emalahleni Region Wandile Ngubeni in May of 2016. The latest killings have sparked fear amongst ANC members in the region. Cele has vowed to restore order by arresting those behind the killing of Sithole. “Maintaining order in Newcastle, we can’t just have people that thrive and they defy the nature of whenever there is a problem they must kill people, it becomes a norm that they must murder people at a certain time that has to come to an end. You heard people saying they are scared; there is a lot of fear around this place.  We can’t as government structures maintaining order, we can’t allow that to continue. “
