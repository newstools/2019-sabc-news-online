Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, has warned his detractors that there is no super language.  Lesufi has received a number of objections to the online registration that was meant to open on Monday. The opening has been postponed to next Monday. The objections, including a lawyer’s letter, coming from Afrikaans organisations including Afriforum and the Suid Afrikaanse Onderwysers Unie. Lesufi says the objections are an attempt to preserve Afrikaans. “There will be no school that will close out other children because they feel their language is more important and they should study alone in that language. If the facilities are fully utilised, there’s no problem but if facilities are not fully utilised, we will bring other children that want to be taught in other languages. If people believe South Africa  does not belong to all of us, it’s unfortunate. This country belongs to all of us and there is no one who is going to stop non-racialism in this country,” says Lesufi.
