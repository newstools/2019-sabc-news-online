Community members of Hills View in White River, Mpumalanga, have embarked on a protest over a land dispute on Wednesday morning. They blockaded roads with burning tyres. This comes after the land earmarked for residential development was allegedly sold to a local farmer. Residents took to the streets blockading the R-538 road which connects with the White River town. They allege that the provincial government has already signed the lease agreement with the farmer.  Granting authority for the new owner to start farming. “The community got agitated and requested the attendance of the mayor and mega representatives to address them in a meeting so that they can elicited the views and what they have as contracts,” says Musa Makukule, who is a community member. Two years ago, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) called on residents to occupy the land. However, the police stopped the occupation. Residents want to have access to the land to build their houses. Basically we would want an assurance from the representatives of government that they are going to fulfil. We do not want any other member to occupy the land,” says Makukule. While attempts to get comment from government were unsuccessful, these aggrieved residents say they will continue seeking commitment to reserve this land to build them houses.
