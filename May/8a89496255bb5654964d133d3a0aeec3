The culpable homicide trial of former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma, is expected to resume on Thursday at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. Zuma is facing one count of culpable homicide and another of reckless and negligent driving. He was initially charged with two counts of culpable homicide, however, the second count was withdrawn when the trial commenced in March. Zuma’s vehicle crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 highway in January 2014, resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube. He is expected to return to court on Thursday to face further cross-examination by state prosecutor Yusuf Baba. The matter was rolled over, due to technical problems relating to the stenographer on Wednesday. During his testimony, Zuma maintained that the crash was not as a result of human error and that he lost control of his Porsche 911 turbo, after hitting a pool of water.
