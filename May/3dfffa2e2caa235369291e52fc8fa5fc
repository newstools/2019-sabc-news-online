The SABC Acting Chief Operations Officer Dr Craig van Rooyen says the recent diesel spillage at the SABC’s Radio Park in Auckland Park could be a re-occurring thing, as the SABC has failed to maintain the upkeep of its infrastructure. This comes after SABC management advised all staff who work at the Radio Park building, not to report for duty on Thursday and Friday, as cleanup operations are still underway following Wednesday’s diesel spill at the building. He says most of the SABC infrastructure is in a poor state, and that is due to the fact it has not been maintained properly in recent years. Van Rooyen says they are still waiting for people to go into the building and do an evaluation of what caused the incident. Watch for more:
