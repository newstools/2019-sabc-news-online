Munsterlos residents in Limpopo are appealing to local authorities to fix on-going water and sanitation problems in their area. Since December 2018, they’ve had to endure a malfunctioning sewer system and an unreliable water supply. The Sekhukhune District Municipality says residents must pay for services. For five months, residents have had to deal with raw sewage flowing through their yards due to blocked manholes and an erratic water supply. The sewage ends up in a nearby dam. Resident Aaron Mahamba says that they have reported the blocked sewerage to the councillor. “The problem is the blockage of the sewerage since December. We tried to report it to our councillor.” The living conditions are posing a health risk. Authorities say the situation is being aggravated by residents’ refusal to pay for services. Mayor Stan Ramaila says that they’ll be able to extend the budget for infrastructure when people start paying for services. “They must pay for the services and then we’ll be able to budget for the extension of the infrastructure, but we’d put them on hold because we are busy finalising our IDP process. We’d put something in place so that we’re able to upgrade their sewer system.” These residents say despite their dire situation, they will cast their ballots on Wednesday. Hopeful their vote will bring change.
