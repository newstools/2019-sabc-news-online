Parents and teachers of Lutholi Junior Secondary school at Sibangweni near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape are up in arms after one of the learners got injured when he fell into a pit toilet at the school. It is alleged that the Grade One learner went to relieve himself when the incident happened. Over a week ago, SABC News covered a protest by parents, the School Governing Body (SGB) and learners who threatened to close the N2 road if the Education Department did not address the issue of the toilets. They alleged that R3 million was approved for renovations at the school but nothing has been done. SGB member Tholekile Norhaqa says, “When we arrived at school, we found teachers in a very worrying situation. We asked what was going on and they told us that a Grade one learner has fallen into the toilet pit. We tried to rescue him and he got injured in the process…” “He came out dirty with human waste. This happens after numerous times of talking to the department of education to address this issue. We told them that we feared that our learners will fall and injure themselves. Now this has happened,” she said. We don’t know what the department of education will say since they don’t care about us, added Norhaqa.  WATCH
