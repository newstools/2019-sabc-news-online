National Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, has highlighted the need for family structures to educate children in order to reduce the number of murders committed by them. The Police Ministry revealed that more than 700 of the 21 000 murders recorded over the last financial year were committed by children. Police Minister Bheki Cele on Thursday briefed Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on the country’s crime statistics. Sitole says children who have committed violent crimes should be rehabilitated. “The police do not take responsibility for family structures but what we are saying is let us work together with the relevant stakeholders. We look at these collapsed family structures and these children bringing up other children.” “Children cannot be treated as hard criminals and put in jail; you need to rehabilitate them so they are able to manage because they are the future of the country,” adds Sitole.
