Former Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is expected to address Jeppestown dwellers in Johannesburg on Sunday. This is to address issues of looting and violence which took the lives of at least seven people. Almost 300 people were arrested in the recent violence that gripped Gauteng. Police Minister Bheki Cele was also expected to address residents over the matter. However, the Police Ministry has since issued a statement saying the Ministerial Imbizo has been postponed.  No reasons were provided. The imbizo was expected to take place in Jeppestown – the epicentre of the recent looting. Over 50 shops were looted and scores of vehicles burnt after a group of people went on a rampage and started looting shops in Johannesburg, including Malvern, Tembisa and Alexandra.
