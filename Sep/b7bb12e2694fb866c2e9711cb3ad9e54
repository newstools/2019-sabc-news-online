Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is heading to Queens High School in Johannesburg following sexual assault allegations of a learner by a teacher. This after a social media post surfaced depicting a parent pleading for assistance after learners’ complaints of sexual assault were allegedly ignored by the school principal. Lesufi will be visiting the school in Bezuidenhout Valley later on Friday. His spokesperson Steve Mabona says the MEC wants to establish the facts for himself. “We cannot tolerate situations whereby learners are assaulted and there’s nothing that has been done. We are going there because there was a social media post by a parent who was pleading for assistance, that they have been reporting this and it seems like the principal is protecting the educator, hence we felt that we need to go immediately,” says Mabona.
