President Ramaphosa was addressing a memorial lecture in honour of Mugabe in Pietermaritzburg on Friday evening. The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has organised a series of memorial lectures for Mugabe. “Soon after they won their own independence they spared no time to immediately become part of the Front Line States and Mugabe became the chairperson of the Front Line States. Because he realised that Zimbabwe’s independence and freedom was not complete without the freedom of the people of South Africa. He knew that their own independence would only be properly sealed if South Africa was free,” says President Ramaphosa. Watch for more:
