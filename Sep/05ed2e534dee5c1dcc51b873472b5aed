The SABC has apologised for the break-in transmission on all radio stations based at the Public Broadcaster’s headquarters in Auckland Park, Johannesburg on Sunday morning. The affected radio stations which are METRO FM, 5FM, Radio 2000, SAFM and RSG were off-air between 07:00  and 08:00 on Sunday morning. SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu says the disruption was due to power failure… “The disruption of broadcast services was due to power failure in and around the Auckland Park area, where the SABC building is located, and the back-up generator not being able to kick-in as expected. The SABC is pleased that these services have been restored.”
