The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) says it welcomes the commission of inquiry appointed by Gauteng Premier David Makhura to look into the taxi violence in the province. The taxi industry has been marred by violence and killings in the past couple of months. Makhura announced on Sunday that the commission will be chaired by retired Judge Jeremiah Shongwe. He has given the commission six months to conduct its investigation, submit a report to him and make recommendations. Santaco deputy president Bafana Magagula says they hope the outcomes of the commission will help bring transformation and peace into the industry. He says: “We welcome the establishment of the commission of inquiry. We hope that it will help our industry with change and transformation.” “We have a responsibility of doing business and not to kill each other. We will welcome the results of the commission and if there are people who must be arrested, we will be happy to see that happen,” adds Magagula.
