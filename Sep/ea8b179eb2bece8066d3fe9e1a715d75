Cape Town police say two men have been arrested for public violence in Milnerton. Incidents of stone-throwing and vandalism started earlier this week, in retaliation to the Cityâ€™s clampdown on traffic offences and taxi operators. A truck and the Phoenix MyCiti Station were set alight on Friday morning and roads blockaded with burning tyres and rubble. A kiosk at a bus station was also raided. On Saturday morning, there have been sporadic flare-ups of public violence in Du Noon and Joe Slovo. Potsdam Road between Sati/Killarney Road and Malibongwe has again been closed due to incidents of stone-throwing. Police say their deployments will remain in the area until they are satisfied that the situation has been stabilised.
