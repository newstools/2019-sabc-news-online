Police are monitoring taxi drivers who have started to assemble at the Bloed Street taxi rank in the Pretoria city centre. Last week, chaos erupted in the CBD as protests turned violent over the killing of taxi driver Jabu Baloyi. He was shot and killed while allegedly trying to stop a drug dealer from selling drugs to youngsters. Foreign-owned shops were looted and set alight shortly after the incident. Taxi drivers allegedly decided to continue with protest action on Monday following Baloyi’s funeral at the weekend. They say they will continue to clean-up Pretoria of what they call ‘nyaope boys’ and drug peddlers. Strubben and Lillian Ngoyi streets are also blocked with buses. The situation remains tense.
