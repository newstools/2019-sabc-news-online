Durban University of Technology student Sandile Ndlovu has died. Ndlovu was stabbed in the institution’s lecture hall earlier in September. He was stabbed in the head. The circumstances of the attack are not clear. Family Spokesperson Tshepo Mokoena says the industrial engineering student succumbed to his injuries in the early hours of Saturday morning at a Durban hospital. Mokoena says the family is distraught. “Unfortunately, Sandile passed on this (Saturday) morning after a long fight. He fought hard. But he succumbed to his injuries. We are shattered. We had sent Sandile to school obviously to come back with an education. It was never in our mind that we’d bring Sandile home in this format. At this point in time, we are shattered and we’re still confused as to what happened but we don’t want to focus on that for now.”
