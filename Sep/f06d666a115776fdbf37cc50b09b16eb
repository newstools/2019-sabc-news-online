One of the key state witnesses in the trial of people accused of murders at the notorious Glebelands Hostel in Durban is expected to be cross-examined in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Monday. The witness told the court that he left the hostel in Umlazi south of Durban after being intimidated by one of the accused. Testifying in camera, the witness told the court that one of the accused, former police officer Bhekukwazi Mdweshu, was the mastermind behind the killings at the hostel. Mdweshu is one of eight people being tried in connection with nine murders at the hostel. The witness has told the court how Mdweshu organised firearms and ammunition that were used to murder residents in the hostel. He said Mdweshu and another accused, Ncomekile Ntshangase, who is a former South African National Defence Force (SANDF) member, would train residents on how to use these firearms.
