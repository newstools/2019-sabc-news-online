SABC Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini has blamed the poor state of the public broadcaster on governance lapses by previous boards. Makhatini is testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture on the state of the SABC when he took the helm October 2017. Prior to his appointment, the Public Protector and a Parliamentary Ad Hoc Committee had pointed to serious mismanagement of the SABC and recommended that a new Board resolve these issues. “The reality of the situation the SABC finds itself today is a result of all of these lapses that happened over previous years as a result of failure by previous boards and management to do what was responsible, and in line with the mandate of the SABC. In terms of adherence to our own policies, in terms of making sure that there was prudence in the manner in which the resources of the SABC were used, it was all compromised… and that is why we find ourselves where we are… but as a Board, what we had then to do was to make sure that we implement these remedial actions and take corrective measures to address the issues.” Watch for more:
