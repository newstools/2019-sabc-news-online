Militants in northeast Nigeria killed at least nine people in an attack on Sunday, sources told Reuters on Monday. One military source and one resident in the town of Gubio in Borno state said the attack on the area began around 16:30 pm and lasted until 21:00 p.m. On Monday, Islamic State claimed the attack in its Amaq news agency, saying it killed and wounded 18 Nigerian soldiers and took vehicles and weapons before fleeing. The resident said that armed men were able to move freely for more than three hours after overpowering soldiers, and that they left without challenge.
