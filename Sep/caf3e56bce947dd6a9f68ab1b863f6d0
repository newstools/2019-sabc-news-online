The Land Party says its legal team will challenge the Overstrand Municipality’s,  in the Western Cape,  decision not to grant them a permit to march against racism. Party leader Gcobani Ndzongana says it is important to highlight what he says is rampant racism in the town. The municipality says in a statement that permission was not granted due to a risk of conflict and injury, among other things. The three-day Whale Festival, which is a major tourist attraction for the coastal town, started on Thursday. Ndzongana is, however, adamant they planned a peaceful march. “Something very important we have to raise; the municipality does not give permission to any political party or people to have a march. They were just issuing the statement so that they can distance themselves to say, ‘we don’t support what is happening here.’ They don’t have a right to even issue that statement, but at the end of the day, everybody has a right to free speech.”
