The United Kingdom Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday (September 24) that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to shut down parliament in the run-up to Brexit was unlawful, a decision that thrusts Britain’s exit from the European Union into deeper turmoil. Johnson told to reporters in New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly that he would “respect the judicial process” but that the UK would still leave the EU on October 31. Britain’s lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, is set to sit on Wednesday (September 25) after the Supreme Court ruled Johnson’s suspension of parliament was unlawful, Commons Speaker John Bercow said.
