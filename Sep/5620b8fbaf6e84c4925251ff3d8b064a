Under the hashtag, #MenWhoCare, hundreds of men have gathered in the Free State to protest against gender-based violence (GBV). Free State Premier, Sisi Ntombela, announced that six women had been killed in the province last week alone. In another incident, it’s alleged that a director at one of the provincial departments had raped his 11-year-old daughter. “We hereby make our voices heard by declaring publicly Genoeg is Genoeg (enough is enough). We have gathered here today side by side as responsible peace loving men as real protectors of our women and sisters. We challenge the normalisation of violence against women and children. We challenge gender stereotypes and roles,” says Free State African National Congress (ANC) secretary, Paseka Nompondo. For more watch video below:
