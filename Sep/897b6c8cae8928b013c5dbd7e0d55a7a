The SABC says it has met almost all the preconditions set by the National Treasury for it to receive the R3 billion injection it has requested. The Broadcaster says the only condition it has not met, is the selling of non-core assets. Board chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini was briefing the Communications Committee in Parliament on the public broadcaster’s Turnaround Plan and updates on various reports. He says the only reason this precondition has not been met is because they are assessing the assets to determine which ones can be sold off. “Understanding the mandate of the SABC and how big the mandate is. For instance we have to broadcast in 14 languages.” “It is not possible and it would be reckless and irresponsible for board to wake up and say we going to sell radio station without doing analysis to understand how it’s going to affect your mandate.” “It may not be performing well but it’s helping us achieve our mandate.” Related video click below:
