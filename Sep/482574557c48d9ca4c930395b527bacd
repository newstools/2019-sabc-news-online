President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for a joint sitting of Parliament to address gender-based violence. The role of men, and their voices against gender-based violence, continue to draw attention. President Ramaphosa and National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, are among those who called on men to take the lead in combating violence against women and girls. When he recently addressed the nation in a televised message, President Ramphosa said gender-based violence is a problem for men. “It is men who rape and kill women. There is therefore an obligation on the men of our country to end such behaviour and such crimes.” The President is to address the nation on Wednesday, with both the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces coming together under one roof. Modise recently questioned whether male MPs have done enough to denounce the wrongs done by other men in society. She says an activist parliament should go beyond the debates in the House and receiving petitions from society. Modise wants the voices of male parliamentarians to be stronger.
