The Gauteng Health Department says it will improve security at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto after attempted hijackings of its doctors. Health MEC Bandile Masuku says a number of doctors have almost been hijacked while entering or leaving the facility. Masuku says he wants to ensure the safety of both patients and staff at the hospital. “Most of our doctors in the last  eight months have had attempted hijacks while leaving the hospital or even coming into the hospital. We have worked with SAPS to try to increase their visibility, we also ask the community to help us, not to be attacking our health workers, we plead with them,” said Masuku. “We are going to take it out with hospital boards and also with community organisations around Soweto,” added Masuku.
