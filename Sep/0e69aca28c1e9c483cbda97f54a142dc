Commuters are not expected to be left stranded on Wednesday as the Metrobus strike has been suspended. Dion Makhura of the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Demawusa) – says the resolution was made in a meeting on Monday. The union downed tools for six days to demand salary progression issues and union office space at Metrobus depots. Makhura explains the reasons for the suspension. “We are battling with the finances to go to work every day, that’s the first issue why we are suspending the strike. We have realised that our enemy is not only Metrobus. It’s a broader fight which includes also the City of Johannesburg, but when we come back, it will be a disaster.”  Click below for related video….
