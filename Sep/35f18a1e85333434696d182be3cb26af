Land Reform Minister Thoko Didiza says she has agreed with the Mayor of Cape Town Daniel Plato to fast-track the process of finding new land within the City of Cape Town for District Six claimants. Didiza made the comments during the ceremony renaming of the Keizersgracht to the original District Six name of Hanover Street in Cape Town. “One of the issues that we need to reflect on beyond today is what we can collectively do to assist in the identification of the land in which we can return back to the claimants of District Six. I am sure that in my discussions today with the mayor, the councillor, the MEC responsible for planning-we agreed that we must find a solution in dealing with this matter.” Didiza says the renaming of Keizersgracht in Cape Town back to its original District Six name of Hanover Street is symbolic of the rebuilding of a nation. She says the street is being given back to the people. “The naming of the street is being brought back to you. It also brings back the pain of forced removals and the subsequent obliteration of your history. The new name became alien to you for it had no meaning. It had no memory that you wish to remember. So the symbol of what we will be doing today adds another important step of building our community.” Keizersgracht in Cape Town has been renamed back to its original name of Hanover Street as part of Heritage Day celebrations.  Didiza presided over the renaming ceremony with hundreds of former District Six residents taking part. Minister Didiza spoke about the significance of the occasion.
