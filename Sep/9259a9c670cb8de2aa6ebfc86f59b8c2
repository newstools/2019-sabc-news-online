Eight infants died in a fire in a hospital in Algeriaâ€™s El Oued early on Tuesday the fire service was quoted as saying on state media without giving any further details. The government has opened an inquiry into the causes of the fire, it added. More than 70 people, including 11 infants, 37 women and 25 hospital workers were rescued. Health Minister Mohamed Bouraoui suspended the hospital manager and the health director of El Oued province, which borders Tunisia, state television reported. The quality of government services has often been a cause of frustration and anger in Algeria, particularly in areas outside the capital.
