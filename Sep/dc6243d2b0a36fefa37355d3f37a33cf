45 African researchers from 12 countries have been selected to participate in a career development program for innovative research and solutions to help African farmers adapt to climate change. The five-year program is expected to train researchers that can assist with policy recommendations that will help the continent to be more food secure. In most cases, the solutions on how to mitigate and adapt against the effects of climate change have come from outside of the continent. Now, a $20 million fellowship dubbed the “One Planet Fellowship” hopes to change that through the training of 630 African and European scientists over the next five years. The fellowship will be implemented by African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (Award) and France’s Agropolis Foundation. The fellowship will cover 12 African countries – six Anglophone countries and six Francophone countries. Fellows will be equipped with skills on scientific research, gender analysis as well as leadership skills.
