The backlash against South Africa is continuing, following violence in which some foreign nationals were being targetted in the country. Nigeria’s governing party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has called on its citizens to boycott South African businesses in the West African country. The party’s national chairperson, Adams Oshiomhole, says they have advised the federal government to take steps to nationalise all South African companies operating in Nigeria. Speaking at a press briefing in the capital Abuja, Oshiomhole also said they wanted South African-owned businesses such as MultiChoice, MTN, Shoprite and Standard Bank to leave the country. He says they will request President Muhammadu Buhari to ban South African Airways (SAA) from operating to and from Nigeria. The  Nigerian government earlier said Nigerians living in South Africa have the chance to leave and come back home amidst the ongoing violence against foreign nationals. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Nigeria said the owner of private Nigeria airline Air Peace Airlines, Chief Allen Onyema, has volunteered to send an aircraft to South Africa to evacuate Nigerians who wish to return home free of charge. Nigeria has strongly condemned the attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa and has even boycotted the World Economic Forum on Africa Summit which took place in Cape Town.
