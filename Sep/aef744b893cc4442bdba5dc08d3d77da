The SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe says the public broadcaster has for many years been subjected to a systematic collapse of governance and a blatant disregard of proper processes and controls. Mxakwe says that irregular expenditure when he was appointed in July 2018 stood at four-point-eight-billion-rand. The public broadcasterâ€™s executive head is currently testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg.
