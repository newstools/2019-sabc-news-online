Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the Heads of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Hawks should not be used by those Malema claims are out to score political points. He was responding to the charge of the assault he’s facing alongside EFF national spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Media reports had suggested that the two assaulted a policeman at a graveyard, during the funeral of the late ANC stalwart, Winnie Madikizela Mandela. Malema says law enforcement officials must apply the law with due diligence. “Someone is sitting somewhere making stupid decisions informed by politics and fear of the right-wing elements like the AfriForum. And then they don’t apply the law…they do that out of fear of AfriForum. Apply the law at all times, doesn’t matter how unpopular it is, apply the law.” Malema arrived at the Hawks Head office in Pretoria, received by hundreds of party supporters. This as Malema was set to give a warning statement with the Hawks on Tuesday. This is in relation to the allegations of discharging a firearm at the EFF fifth anniversary in East London last year. Malema was summoned by the Hawks to come and explain what went on during the celebration, that led to the alleged firearm shot. The EFF leader Malema described the Hawks probe into his alleged firearm incident as ‘mischievous’. Malema says he’s got nothing to answer for and will see the Hawks in court. “If they want to charge they must charge, we’ll speak in court. We don’t think there’s anything to answer to, because they’re being mischievous and we’ll deal with those matters at an appropriate forum if they decide to proceed here with the case. That is the only thing they call me here for. I don’t know why they’re so dramatic.” The EFF leader was accompanied by party leaders, including Gauteng chairperson Mandisa Mashego. Also present are legal heavyweights Advocate Thembeka Ngcukaitobi, criminal lawyer Laurence Hodes, and Ian Lewit.
