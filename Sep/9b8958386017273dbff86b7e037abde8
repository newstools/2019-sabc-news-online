The Pietermaritzburg High Court has asked the media not to publish the names of Wednesday’s state witnesses who will be testifying in the Glebelands Hostel murder case. Eight men are on trial in connection with violence at the Hostel in Umlazi south of Durban. This week the court ruled in favour of an application by leading Investigating Officer, Bhekumuzi Sikhakhane, who had asked that some witnesses be allowed to testify in camera. One of the four state witnesses in the Glebelands trial who had asked to testify in camera has told the court that he witnessed one of the accused Vukani Mcoboti shooting dead hostel resident Fikile Siyephu. Earlier this week the court heard that some witnesses have been killed in Glebelands hostel cases before. The court also heard that out of the four state witnesses who will testify in camera, one has been placed under witness protection programme. The three others have been placed in a place of safety. On Wednesday the court advised the media not to reveal the names of today’s witnesses in order to protect them.
