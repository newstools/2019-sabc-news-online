Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says there is a smear campaign against him. Maimane tweeted that there were individuals that were spreading lies about him and his family. This-following reports that Maimane drove around in a car that was a gift from Markus Jooste. Disgraced former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste was the alleged mastermind behind the biggest corporate scandal in the country. Maimane took to Twitter to say that there are those who are trying to tarnish him and his family’s reputation. This comes after reports that Maimane drove a white Toyota Fortuner that was paid for by former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste before the 2016 June Elections. It is further alleged that Maimane continued to drive the car after the Steinhoff scandal. Jooste came under the spotlight after it was alleged that he was behind the biggest accounting scandal in the history of the country. He is said to be largely responsible for wiping off tens of billions of the company’s value and to pension holders. But the DA says Maimane returned the car after revelations of the Steinhoff matter. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says:”Stienhoff had made a donation to the DA not Mmusi Maimane. The vehicle was to help with campaigning in the Western Cape. At that time there was no risk with that. But as events unfolded and the revelations of Steinhoff became of public matter, the party had a discussion about this issue.” Malatsi is of the view that there are efforts to taint Maimane in a bad light. “It is quite clear by the stories driven in the media that there seems to be a campaign to taint his name in the public front.”  Click video below:
