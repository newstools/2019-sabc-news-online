US President Donald Trump has tweeted that has asked for and received the resignation of his National Security Advisor John Bolton. President Trump says there were disagreements in his administration over many of Bolton’s suggestions. This is the third National Security Advisor to be shown the door since Trump took office in January of 2017. The tweet from President Trump announcing his departure comes after the White House press office indicated that Bolton was scheduled to appear later Tuesday at a press briefing alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Bolton also tweeted later that he’d offered to resign last night but that President Trump responded that they’d talk more the next day. That talk appears not to have taken place given the President’s tweet about his departure. Sharp disagreements with the outgoing National Security Advisor over the handling of talks with North Korea and the Taliban in Afghanistan appear to have played a role. Trump has indicated he would name a new national security advisor next week. Previous NSAs Michael Flynn and HR Macmaster too did not last long before being relieved of their positions earlier in the administration.
