Rand Water has taken a decision to reduce water supply to three of its municipal customers due to non-payment for services rendered. The municipalities include Emfuleni in Gauteng as well as Govan Mbeki and Victor Khanye in Mpumalanga. Emfuleni municipality owes Rand Water R423 million, Victor Khanye owes R111 million Govan Mbeki owes R179 million. Rand Water says water pressure in Emfuleni will be reduced by 20%. The company spokesperson Justice Mohale says the measures will be with effect from Tuesday next week. He says: “We as Rand Water have on many occasions entered into payment agreements but these municipalities have failed to abide by the legal obligations.”
