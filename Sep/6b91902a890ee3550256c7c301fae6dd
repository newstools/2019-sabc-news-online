The murdered Western Cape policeman, warrant officer Hilton Joseph, has been described as a dedicated official who always put his job ahead of his personal life. Police Minister Bheki Cele paid a visit to the Joseph’s family in Eerste River on Wednesday, including that of Constable Terrance Mostert who was wounded in the incident. The policemen were attacked outside a tavern in Mfuleni on Sunday. The grief-stricken Joseph family still coming to terms with their loss. Their father died in hospital after he was shot in the head. His 22-year-old son, Keanu Joseph, says he was a loving father, devoted to his work. “My father was a very strong person. he loved his job he was a strict person. He was a man of few words, he was full of love and joy and like I said he loved his family and his job. Most those were the two times he spent most of his time he was such a great example for us.” Joseph’s colleague 29-year-old Constable Terrance Mostert was shot in the neck. He’s now out of the hospital and recovering at home in Kuilsriver, but he’s still traumatised. Police Minister Bheki Cele says police officers in the Western Cape are vulnerable because of the level of criminality. “ We brought more and more resources both personnel human resources and the equipment. We have started the AGU here though it is going to be nationally, but we have started it here we have an army here. The minister of defence gave the answer when he was asked about the extension yesterday, its one of the reason it’s dangerous – gangersterism and criminally surely as we will be releasing stats tomorrow it will be indicated that this remains one of the most dangerous areas the Western Cape.” Two suspects aged 30 and 31-years-old have been arrested. They are due to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s court on Thursday.
