The South Gauteng High Court has found parts of the RICA act inconsistent with the constitution. RICA stands for the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information. The investigative journalism unit amaBhungane challenged the RICA Act in 2017 after its journalist Sam Sole’s communications was intercepted while he was reporting on the corruption investigation against then-President Jacob Zuma. “My communications with the chief prosecutor were intercepted and we were not aware of that until much later during the spy tapes which did, in fact, involve president Zuma and among the interceptions coming out in the spy tapes there was a transcript of those conversations between me and the chief prosecutor so we could prove for one that I have been monitored.” Click on the video below:
