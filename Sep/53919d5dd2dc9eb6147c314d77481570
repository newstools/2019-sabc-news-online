The Durban University of Technology(DUT) says it has stepped up security at the institution following the murder of 18-year-old student Sandile Ndlovu. Ndlovu died in hospital a few days after he was stabbed in a university lecture hall on the Steve Biko campus earlier this month. Nine students were also arrested in a protest this month for allegedly assaulting a security guard, pouring petrol on him and attempting to set him alight. Vice Chancellor Professor Thandwa Mthembu says the institution has put tight security measures in place. He says: “We remain committed towards ensuring the overall safety and security of all students and staff. We also recognise that crime and violence are prevalent in our country, even among our own students.’ “DUT is not immune from this as we have unfortunately witnessed in the criminal and violent attack against Ndlovu. Our team is working hard to ensure that we follow the correct procurement process to appoint a security service provider before the end of October. We are investing R30 million in security system upgrades.” “We will continue to support police in their investigation into the tragic attack of Ndlovu and we are committed towards ensuring that we do not compromise the 2019 academic programme,” adds Mthembu.
