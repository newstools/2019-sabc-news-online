Judgment is expected to take place the Labour Court on Friday in the Johannesburg Metrobus strike matter. Metrobus approached the court to interdict the strike. Metrobus workers belonging to the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union (Demawusa) have been on strike since Monday over matters relating to salary progression and office space. “There’s no judgment which is stopping the strike now, the strike is continuing. We are just disappointed by the employer that instead of resolving the problem, they run to the courts. This is a third sitting now and we think the employer is negotiating in bad faith,” says Dion Makhura of Demawusa. Watch a related video below:
