 Former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is expected to be laid to rest soon, after his body was taken back to his home village of Kutama Zvimba. There is a strong indication that Mugabe will be buried in Kutama. On Thursday the Zimbabwean government confirmed that Mugabe will no longer be buried in the Heroes Acre memorial in the capital, Harare as previously announced. Following his death on 6 September, there was disagreement between Mugabe’s family and the administration of current President Emmerson Mnangagwa on where he would be buried. Mugabe’s body has been kept at his Blue Roof home in Harare since his State funeral service on 14 September.
