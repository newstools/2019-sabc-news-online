Corruption will be investigated in the construction of the Nessie Knight hospital in the Eastern Cape; thatâ€™s according to Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize. Millions earmarked for the building have gone missing. Mkhize was addressing villagers in Zimbane village at the official opening of two National Health Insurance (NHI) clinics in Maxwele and Lotana in the O.R. Tambo region in the Eastern Cape. The clinics are among eight National Health Insurance clinics to be opened in the district, with president Cyril Ramaphosa opening one at Lusikisiki next week. Mkhize says this is meant to address challenges faced by villagers such as overcrowding and medicine shortages. He empathised that the NHI will ensure rural communities have access to quality health care services. For more watch video below:
