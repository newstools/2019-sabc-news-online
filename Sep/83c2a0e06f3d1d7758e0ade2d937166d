President Cyril Ramaphosa has addressed the nation on the scourge of public and gender-based violence (GBV) – saying he will ask Parliament to consider making the sexual offences register public. The President says he also wants officials to overhaul the database of sexual offenders. Ramaphosa was speaking amid national outrage over the recent brutal attacks on women including the murder of boxing champion Leighandre Jegels and the rape and murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana. The President says men have to make a choice. President Ramaphosa also used his national address to strongly condemn the attacks on foreign nationals. At least nine people have been killed in the violence in Gauteng and numerous shops looted or burnt. Ramaphosa says South Africans should welcome the contributions that foreign nationals make to the country. He says South Africa owes a debt of gratitude to African countries that supported freedom fighters during the battle against Apartheid. Watch the President’s address to the nation:    Meanwhile – In the pre-recorded televised message by President Ramaphosa to the nation, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC),  inadvertently broadcast an incorrect version of the President’s speech on SABC television News, while the correct version was played across all SABC radio stations. The public broadcaster wishes to apologise to the President of the Republic and the nation for any embarrassment caused in this unfortunate breach of news production processes. SABC Spokesperson, Vuyo Mthembu  says the SABC takes this issue very seriously, and can assure the President and the public that due processes will be followed and appropriate action taken.
