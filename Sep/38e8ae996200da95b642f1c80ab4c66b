Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has expressed sadness following the fatal shooting of a grade six learner in Katlehong on Gauteng’s East Rand. The 12-year-old from Mogobeng Primary school was hit by a stray bullet outside a neighbouring school during an alleged taxi-related shooting. She died later in hospital. A man who had gone to fetch his grandchildren at Izibuko Primary School was also shot. He was declared dead on the scene. Lesufi visited the child’s school before going to her home. He says that he is in a state of shock. “We’re indeed in a state of shock. And I always say that it pains me to issue death certificates rather than issue Matric certificates. From our side as a department, we’ll leave no stone unturned in providing support to these learners. The thing that hurts me the most is that we have planted a seed of violence in the minds of our children and they’ll never forget. But we want to call up the police to have these people arrested within the next 72 hours.”
