Minister of Police Bheki Cele has commended officers in KwaZulu-Natal who foiled a robbery, recovered scores of firearms and arrested a suspect. Nine other suspects were killed in a shootout with police in Isipingo, south of Durban on Friday. It is alleged that the suspects had planned to rob a business premise, but when they arrived, police were waiting for them. Cele called it a successful sting operation. “I’m told that those were known criminals, well prepared to go … look at the kind of the weapons they had; the AK47’s that were there. So, I think police here were well prepared for the operation. I’m waiting for a full report, especially from the provincial commissioner. Maybe, they will make the full comment, but for now it looks like police have a very successful operation.”
