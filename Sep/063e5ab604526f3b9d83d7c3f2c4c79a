About 300 Nigerian nationals have left South Africa heading back to their home country from the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. This is the first group of Nigerians who are being repatriated back to their country of origin out of fear following the recent wave of violent attacks in Johannesburg and Pretoria. Their flight which was due to take off just after 9 oâ€™clock on Wednesday was delayed due to immigration processes and procedures which had to be followed to verify everyone on the plane. Earlier, about 30 Nigerians who wanted to leave were turned away from boarding the flight, due to them not having the correct flight documentation, mainly for their infant children. The Nigerian High Commission says a privately owned airline, Air Peace, has offered free flights to those wanting to leave South Africa. Click below for more on the story:
