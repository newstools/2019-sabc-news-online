President Cyril Ramaphosa called for the harshest sentence to be imposed on those who are found guilty of killing women and children. He was speaking at Copesville outside Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal, where he visited family members of four children who were killed allegedly by their father at Wyebank west of Durban earlier this month. President Ramaphosa says government is working hard to find strategic ways to help fight violence against women and children. President Ramaphosa also welcomed the sentence of four life terms of imprisonment that the High Court sitting in Middelburg, Mpumalanga has handed down after 25-year-old Zinhle Maditla murdered her four children by poisoning them. “We’ve just heard today that the woman who killed the four children in Mpumalanga got four life sentences. We want the harshest sentence so that it can be an example and a deterrent to other people who may be motivated that way. We got to end the killing of women, young women and children in our country. The measures we announced in parliament are now going to take route. We are going to make sure that we launch a massive campaign for preventative measures.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
