The funeral service of businessman, Gavin Watson will take place on Tuesday in Port Elizabeth. The 71-year-old Eastern Cape-born Watson died in a car accident in Gauteng last week. Watson died amidst controversy about his role in state capture, and facing an investigation by the SA Revenue Services (SARS). African National Congress (ANC) top brass in the Nelson Mandela Bay, including Chairperson of the Regional Task Team Nceba Faku, and Member of Parliament Cedric Frolick, raised the party’s flag outside the family home, to commemorate him. Watson’s younger brother, Valance, thanked the ANC for its support. “Of course, in a bereavement like this you would like to know there are people feeling the pain. They have been exceptional. We thank the ANC and its components for the support they have given us. I also thank many people across the race barrier line that have given us the notes of support, for the support they have given us.” Watch video below for more on the story:
