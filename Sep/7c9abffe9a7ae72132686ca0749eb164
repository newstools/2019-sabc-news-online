The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee member Derek Hanekom has welcomed the ruling of the High Court in Durban in his defamation lawsuit against the former President Jacob Zuma. In a statement which he has published on Twitter, Hanekom says he’s pleased that the court ruled that Zuma’s statement was defamatory and false and that the phrase “known enemy agent” implied that Hanekom was an “apartheid spy”.  The court also ordered Zuma to apologise to Hanekom within 24 hours and remove the tweet. This is how Judge Dhaya Pillay handed down judgment. “The respondent is interdicted from publishing any statement that says or implies that the applicant is or was an enemy agent or an Apartheid spy. The interdicted on this paragraph does not bare the respondent from testifying truthfully, as he is requesting judicial commission of enquiry into the allegations of the state capture, corruption and fraud including organs of state,” says Pillay.
