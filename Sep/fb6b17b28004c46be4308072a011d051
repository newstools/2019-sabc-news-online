The Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union (Demawusa) and the Johannesburg Metrobus management are heading to the Labour Court on Wednesday as the union’s members forge ahead with strike action until their demands are met. Metrobus workers belonging to Demawusa embarked on an indefinite strike on Monday over salary progression issues. Meanwhile, Metrobus says their bus, that was reported hijacked on Wednesday morning, has since been found parked at a Ghandi Square bus terminal in central Johannesburg. Demawusa spokesperson, Dion Makhura, says the two parties could not come to an agreement in Tuesday’s negotiations. “Today we are not meeting, we met them yesterday where we did not agree about the picketing. They say we must picket 500 meters away from their building and only 10 people are allowed to picket. They have taken us to the Labour Court at 10. We have only two demands: they have to pay salary progressions, where we are saying people have to paid in terms of their experience. The second is we have to have access to resources,” says Makhura.
