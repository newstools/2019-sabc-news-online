The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has announced that contingency plans are in place ahead of the anticipated bank strike on Friday. In a statement, Sars says that it will work with all role players to avert any disruptions to the country’s financial system. Over 40 000 members affiliated to the  Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)  and the South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) are expected to down tools over retrenchments in the banking sector in what they have declared a total shutdown. Sasbo says the union will ensure that ATM’s and banking operations are not functional. In Gauteng, it will start at Cosatu House down to the bank city where the memorandum will be handed over. In Durban, they will go to the city hall. Meanwhile,  Business Unity South Africa (Busa) says they have applied for an interdict to halt the strike.  Busa’s Cas Coovadia says a ruling on the interdict will be handed down on Wednesday. “We have applied for an interdict and we are expecting a ruling tomorrow (Wednesday). We applied for the interdict because the strike has been planned on the basis of a Section 77 notice that was actually done in August 2017 and our legal people are of the view that the notice is outdated and so we have applied for an interdict and we are awaiting the ruling tomorrow  (Wednesday).” Click below for more on the story:
