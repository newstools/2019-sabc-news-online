Eskom has announced that Mandla Maleka has been appointed Interim Group Treasurer following the end of Andre Pillay’s tenure. Maleka joined Eskom Treasury in 1999 after serving as a Director in the National Treasury Budget Office. He is currently the company’s Chief Economist and Head of Portfolio Management and Foreign Exchange trading. Chief Financial Officer Calib Cassim says Maleka’s appointment ensures continuity until a permanent Group Treasurer can be appointed. In July,  Pillay became the latest high-profile resignation from the struggling power utility. Eskom has confirmed his resignation. Pillay’s departure was less than two months after the resignation of Eskom CEO, Phakamani Hadebe.
