Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Health has called on the public to make either written or oral submissions on the National Health Insurance Bill. The aim of the Bill is to provide universal health care to all South Africans. Interested parties can write to the committee or indicate whether they want to make an oral submission. This must reach the committee by 11 October.  The NHI was tabled by Dr Zweli Mkhize before Parliament after approval by the cabinet. Mkhize says there’s a ten point plan to improve health care services; this includes dealing with staff and medicine shortages, fixing inadequate equipment and ageing infrastructure. The South African Medical Research Council (MRC) says mistakes will be made and corrected along the road. The Health Professionals Council of South Africa says it’s also gearing itself for the NHI. The Health Minister says 42 million citizens have been registered for the scheme and the remainder of the population will be registered by the end of 2019. The bill is expected to be fully implemented in 2026. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
