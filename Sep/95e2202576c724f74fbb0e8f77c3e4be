Industry experts have welcomed news that some of the Gautrain buses are to be powered by hydrogen instead of diesel. Hydrogen is seen as a clean alternative to fossil fuels, which are accelerating climate change. There are plans to introduce hydrogen power to Rea Vaya buses as well. “Twenty of the 125 buses operated by the Gautrain management agency are now earmarked to switch from diesel to clean hydrogen and when we say green hydrogen, we mean clean hydrogen that is produced from the sun or the wind. And South Africa has great capacity in that because we have superior sun and prime wind. We’re seen as one of the world’s hot spots for developing hydrogen, which is now viewed by the world as the counter action to climate change,” says publishing editor of Engineering News and Mining Weekly, Martin Creamer.
