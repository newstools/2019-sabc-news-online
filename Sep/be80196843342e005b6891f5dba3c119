Police are investigating a double-murder after two people from Noordgesig near Soweto were beaten to death, allegedly by a group of people from nearby Pennyville in New Canada. Police found the deceased hanging upside down from street poles on Wednesday. They were accused of stealing a car battery in Pennyville. Tensions flared after residents from Noordgesig barricaded the streets in an attempt to retaliate against the murders. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says police are monitoring the area. “We have not arrested anybody but we are following the leads in terms of the people who were involved in the beating of these two people who died. We have been engaging with the community to make sure we bring order in the area.”
