Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane says the province is ready to implement the Integrated District Service Delivery model aimed at maximising service delivery. He addressed public servants of OR Tambo District Municipality on Thursday in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. The delivery model is expected to be officially launched at the OR Tambo district by President Cyril Ramaphosa next week. Mabuyane says in this model, the provincial government and districts will work hand in hand to address inequalities. “The model gives us this idea of government that is not working in a silo, an integrated approach government working from local, district province and national together with one plan. It’s an opportunity we can’t miss, where we will also explain to the President what our plans are as far as the development trajectory of this area is concerned. An area that is so underdeveloped, so challenged,” says Mabuyane. Watch a related video below:
