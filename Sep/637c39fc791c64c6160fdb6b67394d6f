The former SABC Chief Operations Officer (COO) Hlaudi Motsoeneng has referred to the deal he signed with Multichoice that produced the 404 news channel and SABC Encore channels as his legacy. He is testifying for a third consecutive day at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Motsoeneng served as COO of the public broadcaster from 2011 to 2016 and was removed from the position after being found guilty of putting the SABC into disrepute for holding a media briefing in which he strongly criticised management. Motsoeneng says he personally raised funds for the public broadcaster.  “When you talk about my legacy, those two channels and the employment of people. It is good for South Africa to have people who can go and negotiate and try to use the tactic that I was using,” says Motsoeneng. The former SABC COO has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg that when he left the public broadcaster everything collapsed. “When I was acting COO, the SABC was having blackouts. They could not watch Bafana Bafana in Africa, they could not watch Bafana Bafana locally, here always it was delayed. I went to France and met this guy, I was with the head of sports, three GCEO’s went to negotiate with him they could not come with what I came with. People were shocked that I was able to achieve that, I could bring sports back today as we are talking,” says Motsoeneng. Watch a related video below:
