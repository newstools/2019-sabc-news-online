Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande says South Africans should embrace the technological advancements of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The Minister has, however, warned that this will result in job losses. Nzimande has been addressing delegates on the second day of the South African Democratic Teachers Union’s (Sadtu) elective conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg. “We expect educators to be at the forefront of technological advancements because if educators are not at the forefront, the nation as a whole will remain behind. We must embrace those technological developments and advances. Technology has the capacity to resolve many problems facing humanity, but technology in the hands of exploiters, it will serve the purpose of exploitation.”
