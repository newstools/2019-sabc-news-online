Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says addressing xenophobic violence will require co-operation across party political lines. The DA has also called for the deployment of more police and the urgent sharing of intelligence. At least 13 people were killed during the attacks on foreign nationals in Gauteng. Maimane and Johannesburg Public Safety MMC, Micheal Sun, handed a memorandum of demands at the Johannesburg Central Police Station. Maimane says he has asked President Cyril Ramaphosa for an urgent meeting. “Parliament must be able to create a joint national working committee that can ensure that it gives guidance and response. This is not about one party versus another, this is about what is good for the country and thirdly I am saying let us create one centralised communication point so that citizens know where they are coming from. I have written to him on behalf of other opposition leaders to say let us convene that meeting urgently and that where there are criminals, we ultimately make sure that they are behind bars whether they are citizens or they are policemen. Where there is corruption we must act collectively as a country,” says Maimane. Watch a related video below:
