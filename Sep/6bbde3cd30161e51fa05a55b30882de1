The South African Council of Churches (SACC) will on Sunday hold a prayer service for the recent violence that has been happening in the country. The SACC says there should be no room for criminal acts of violence against people and properties, adding that such acts must be condemned everywhere without equivocation. “The issues of competition for scarce employment opportunities, and the belief that foreign Africans in particular, are part of the problem, is at the core of these protests. There is a special negative focus on African foreign nationals, which is a problematic categorisation amounting to the black-on-black violence of old, when we attacked each other on our tribal identities in apartheid days,” says SACC. It says it appeals to all communities to desist from the violence which will land them in acts of criminality.
