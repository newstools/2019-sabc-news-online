Police are maintaining a strong presence in Katlehong, on Gauteng’s East Rand after locals burnt shacks belonging to foreign nationals – demanding that they leave the area. While some of the foreign nationals fled to the local police station, some remained in the vicinity hoping to rescue some of their belongings. This morning the bodies of two people were discovered in the area, bringing to nine the number of people killed in Gauteng since the start of the violence and looting.  Meanwhile, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina has appealed for calm. “The issue that is emerging there now is that there is a group of people who say they are targeting certain nationalities who are South Africans; which is a major problem. So, we’ve got to go there and engage with the community to make people understand that South Africa belongs to all who lives in it.” Masina adds: “When we start to discriminate amongst ourselves when we know that we are a country with eleven official languages and we say “no these ones are unwanted here” So, I think it’s a serious issue that the leadership and the Premier will have to intervene.”
