The price of petrol will increase by 11 cents to R16 per litre and diesel will go up by 26 cents to R15 per litre on Wednesday. The fuel hikes were brought on by a sharp decline in the local currency in August. The rand dropped by more than 10% against the greenback over global trade uncertainty and rising chances of credit downgrades locally.
