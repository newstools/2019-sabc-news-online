South African Airways (SAA) is in the process of roping in the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to look into more than 84 contracts that the airline says are questionable. The national airline says it wants the assistance of the SIU so it can recover the money or cancel contracts. Officials of the national carrier were briefing Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises on progress made in addressing governance problems. Chief Risk and Compliance Officer Vusi Pikoli says they’re also centralising all cases that are with the NPA in order to deal with them effectively. “And then also we have brought in place the SIU to look at about 84 questionable contracts within SAA. We are in the last stages of finalising the presidential proclamation which will enable the SIU to delve deeper in some of the contracts to make sure that we are able to deal with these matters effectively.”
