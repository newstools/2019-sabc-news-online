More people continue to arrive outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in Sandton north of Johannesburg where hundreds of activists have already gathered for the #ShutDownSandtonÂ  protest. They are calling on big business to get involved and help fund initiatives aimed at curbing violence against women and children. The protest is led by Call-to-Action, a consortium representing over 70 civil society groups. Several roads including Maude, West, Rivonia and Gwen lane have been closed to traffic.
