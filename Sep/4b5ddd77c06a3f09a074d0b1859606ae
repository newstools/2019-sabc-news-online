President Cyril Ramaphosa used a memorial lecture of the late former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to reflect on organisational matters within the African National Congress (ANC). He was addressing ANC supporters in Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday evening. Ramaphosa reflected on the close relations the ANC shared with Mugabe and the people of Zimbabwe. Speaking about the National General Council (NGC) to be held next year, he warned members about people who might want to see the ANC crumble under further divisions. This was the second in a series of lectures organised by the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal to honour Mugabe. “I hope when we go to the NGC next year, we will be able to solidify that unity. So, those who say comrades we will see who stands with who and how – we must disappoint them and prove them wrong and show them that the NGC is going to consolidate the unity of our movemen. The NGC is for renewal, it for revival. The NGC is to see how far we have gone, and comrades in this regard, I wish to salute you in KZN for the manner in which you are working to forge unity amongst yourselves.” Watch the memorial lecture below:
