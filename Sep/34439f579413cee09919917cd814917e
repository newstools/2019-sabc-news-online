Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says it’s embarrassing and absurd that Cedar Park Properties has been receiving services from the city but not paying for them. Speaking on Morning Live, Mashaba says he doesn’t understand why the previous administration which is the African National Congress (ANC), made a deal of this nature. Recently the City of Johannesburg cut water supply to the busy Gautrain station in Sandton over unpaid service, because owners of the property failed to pay R8 million in bills owed to the city. Mashaba says the City will not reconnect the water until it has received payment. An investigation is underway regarding the transaction of land, and Mashaba says he believes the information will be brought to light.  Watch interview with Herman Mashaba below:
