The Nigerian government says Nigerians living in South Africa have the chance to return home amidst the on-going violence against foreign nationals. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Nigeria says the owner of private Nigeria airline Air Peace Airlines, Chief Allen Onyema, has volunteered to send an aircraft to South Africa on Friday to evacuate Nigerians free of charge. Nigeria has strongly condemned the attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa and has even boycotted the World Economic Forum on Africa Summit currently taking place in Cape Town. The attacks on foreign-owned businesses in South Africa have angered many Nigerians who feel they are being unfairly targetted. Related video click below:
