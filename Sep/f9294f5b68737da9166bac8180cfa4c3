Voting is under way in a by-election at Ward 20 in Nelson Mandela Bay, with rival political parties contesting the position of ward councillor. The position was vacated by the imprisonment of African National Congress (ANC) councillor, Bongo Nombimba. He is serving a five year sentence for fraud and money laundering. The ward is crucial to both the ANC and the Democratic Alliance (DA) led alliances in the metro. Almost 3 300 voters have registered for the by- election. Most of the voters want a councillor who will pay attention to their needs. “If anything happens I want to go to that councillor and say you have promised us this and that why it is not happening now. Honour your promises.” “I want a councillor that can build our community provide housing and schooling for our children that is why I am voting for this councillor.”
