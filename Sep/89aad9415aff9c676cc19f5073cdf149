Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has accused President Cyril Ramaphosa and his allies of trying to profit from state-owned assets, a move which Malema claims will destroy the economy. Malema also says Ramaphosa is incapable of fixing the country’s economy, even with the help of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Mboweni last week released a discussion document on the Treasury website that outlines a strategy to rescue the country’s ailing economy. Read the strategy document below:     Malema says all political parties and trade unions need to unite to protect state assets. “The white monopoly capital bought SA in Nasrec when it elected Cyril Ramaphosa as president. They want to take every asset owned by the state for the sake of making profit and personal accumulation. It is something that we are not going to agree, and we are going to make sure that we mobilise all the left forces, put aside out political differences and come together to protect the asset of the people of SA which Cyril, through Tito Mboweni wants to sell to his friends.” Click on the video below:
