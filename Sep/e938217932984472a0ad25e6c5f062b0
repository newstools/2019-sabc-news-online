Metrobus says commuters need not worry about transport on Monday. This is despite labour union Demawusa’s threat to continue its strike. The company says it obtained an interdict against the strike on Friday after the union’s five- day stay away but Demawusa is disputing this. Metrobus spokesperson, Goodwill Shivuri, says they expect to run a fully functional operation Monday. “I just wanna urge and plead with our commuters to wake up early tomorrow go to their bus stops, Ghandi Square, we will be there to serve them. Demawusa makes a very minimal number of our employees with what we have and the guarantee of safety that the court has called off the strike for now. We are able to operate without Demawusa members but these are city employees we do expect them to come back to work tomorrow.” Related Video Below:
