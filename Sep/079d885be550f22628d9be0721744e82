Police have confiscated large quantities of counterfeit goods during a raid at Dragon City – a wholesale centre in Fordsburg, Johannesburg.  The operation forms part of ongoing SAPS operations, targeting illegal traders and goods. Over 15 people have been arrested following the raid. The suspects were arrested for offences ranging from possession of counterfeit goods to illegal electricity connections by Joburg City Power. The worth of the goods seized is estimated at more than R10-million. Last month foreign nationals turned on police following a similar raid in the CBD. It’s believed this incident sparked a spate of looting across Gauteng. For more on the strory, watch video below:
