Wits University students have threatened that classes will not continue until adequate measures are put in place to ensure women’s safety on campus. Scores of students at the main campus in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, have raised concern about the way the university handles sexual assault cases. They spoke out during an SRC-led campus march where they handed over a memorandum demanding self-defence classes for females, paid for by the university. The SRC’s Gender and Transformation Officer Wits University, Sibongile Sibeko says they have given Wits management 24 hours to respond. “Practical steps such as those, we expect the university to respond to tomorrow, and if not then classes are not just going to be closed for today… classes will continue to be closed until we are taken seriously, because indeed, we are tired of fighting with the university for our safety and for our protection. We can’t study in an environment where we don’t feel safe and protected.”  Click video below:
