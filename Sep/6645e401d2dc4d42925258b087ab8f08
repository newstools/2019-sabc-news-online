President Cyril Ramaphosa has called an extraordinary Joint Sitting of Parliament to discuss the scourge of gender based violence on Wednesday. Parliament’s spokesperson Manelisi Wolela says the President invoked section 84 of the constitution and the Joint Rules of Parliament to address members of the NCOP and National Assembly on special business. Wolela says both National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and NCOP Chairperson Amos Masondo have received Ramaphosa’s letters regarding the calling for the joint sitting. The President has articulated very clearly the matters to be discussed – incidences of violence that have engulfed South Africa – particularly in the past few weeks. In his letter he says it has to be a responsibility of every individual  in South Africa and every institution to come together and use the recent spate of violence against women and children as a fundamental turning point in fighting and defeating the scourge of gender-based violence.
