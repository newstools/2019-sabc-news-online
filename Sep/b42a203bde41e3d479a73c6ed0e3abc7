The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has warned motorists to avoid Sandton, north of the city, on Friday morning. A consortium of 70 civil organisations and individual activists have threatened to shut down the business district.  The Call-to-Action grouping says this is in response to the rise in the number of gender-based violence cases. It says it specifically intends on shutting down the city due to lack of responsibility or duty of care from corporate businesses. The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department’s (JMPD) spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar, highlighted the areas to avoid. “Traffic will be diverted on certain roads in Sandton for a protest march. Rivonia road will be blocked off between 5th street and Greyston Drive where the majority of the protesters will gather. Maude street will also be blocked off at Gwen Lane at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Motorists are advised to avoid those streets from 3AM up until 2pm tomorrow (Friday).”
