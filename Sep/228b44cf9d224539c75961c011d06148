The Amazulu King has urged government to seek guidance and engage traditional leaders in solving the country’s problems and to strengthen relations with the rest of the world in light of the recent attacks on foreign nationals. King Zwelithini was speaking at the commemoration of Shaka Day in KwaDukuza on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. The King of the Zulu nation feels President Cyril Ramaphosa should have sought their counsel as traditional leaders before sending envoys to African states to apologise for the attack on foreign nationals. King Shaka Zulu is credited for unifying the nation owing to his efforts in incorporating small chiefdoms into the Amazulu Kingdom. King Zwelithini lamented the attacks on foreign nations and gender-based violence. He says he is not criticising the government for sending envoys to apologise to African states, but it would have been better if they had sought wisdom from traditional leadership. As the theme for this year celebrations is the promotion of our diverse indigenous languages, universities are amongst institutions lauded for preserving African languages. KZN Premier, Sihle Zikalala, has commended universities for preserving African languages. “We would like to commend efforts being made by universities for deepening and preserving African languages. UKZN in particular, has programmes.” Those in attendance felt revived after being part of the Heritage ceremony. The King also bemoaned the Constitutional Court ruling which recently banned the spanking of children. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
