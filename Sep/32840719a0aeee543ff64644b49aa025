Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni, has thanked delegates at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Africa in Cape Town for not abandoning South Africa due to the incidents of violence it’s facing. Mboweni was delivering his closing remarks at WEF. The forum was held against the backdrop of violent attacks on shops mainly those belonging to foreign nationals as well as protests against Gender-Based Violence (GBV). On the first day of the conference, young people protested outside the conference venue to highlight their frustration against the escalating gender-based violence. Mboweni says young people should be allowed to expresses themselves on issues that they’re unhappy about. “Thank you for coming despite the difficulties which we are facing at the moment and thank you for understanding that these are issues we have to deal with and you did not abandon us when you saw young people expressing themselves as young people indeed should express what they are unhappy about.” The three-day meeting brought together some heads of states and business leaders from across the world and the continent. Mboweni opened the meeting on behalf of President Cyril Ramaphosa.
