The City of Cape Town has condemned the on-going unrest and vandalism at Du Noon. The unrest began earlier this week, allegedly in response to an operation by traffic services around minibus taxis. A MyCiTi station and a truck were set alight in the area on Friday morning. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says those responsible should be arrested. “Their conduct is a disgrace. The violence, injuries and damage to public and private property cannot be condoned and the City calls on the SAPS to arrest those responsible. The City strongly condemns the disruption to motor vehicle traffic and commuters yesterday (Thursday) and today (Friday) as well as the cowardly attacks on private motor vehicles by so called protesters. We have also had at least two incidents where traffic officers have been attacked and we call on anyone with information to come forward so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. “
