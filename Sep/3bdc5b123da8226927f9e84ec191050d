The Durban University of Technology (DUT) student who was brutally stabbed earlier this month has been buried at Rocky’s Drift Cemeteries in White River, Mpumalanga. Sandile Ndlovu, who was a first-year industrial engineering student, was in a coma after being stabbed in a lecture room at the University’s Steve Biko Campus. Ndlovu’s uncle Tshepo Mokoena says they are sad that his nephew’s killers are yet to be apprehended. “There has been nothing much coming out of the investigations at this point in time. The only thing we received is that DUT has released the footage. The latest is that the footage was taken in for maintenance. So there are contradicting stories and as result the investigation officers are struggling; and seeing that DUT is not coming to the party and SAPS is not moving with the case, we decided to get services of a private investigator,” explains Mokoena.
