The three Johannesburg Metro Police officers who were accused of shooting and killing journalist Godknows Nare have been found not guilty by the High Court in Johannesburg. In 2017, an investigation by police watchdog, Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), revealed that the three officers, Nhlanhla Vilakazi, Lincoln Moloyi and Thozamile Mhlanga staged a crime scene after they shot and killed Nare. They were charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice. The three accused looked confident when they entered the courtroom on Friday, wearing t-shirts branded, not guilty at the back. Judge Mokhine Mosopa said the state failed to provide evidence to support the charges of murder and defeating the ends of charges against the three. The judge added that the officersâ€™ lawyer managed to convince him that the three acted in self-defence. The officers left the court jubilant after learning of their acquittal.
