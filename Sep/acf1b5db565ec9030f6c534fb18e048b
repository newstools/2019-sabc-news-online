Hundreds of small scale farmers have recieved tractors, farming implements and seeds to help sustain their livelihoods and to improve food security at Ndumo in the uMkhanyakude district in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The project, that is being led by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala, aims to improve the lives of farmers by providing them with the necessary farming tools to help them develop. It is believed to be a flagship project aimed at alleviating poverty in the area. A small scale farmer says they were battling with resources however they hope this project will help them sustain their farms. He says: “We are happy that they will bring us the infrastructure that we need but at Kwa-Mdungu we also need water, we battling because of the drought.” Zikalala together with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development says they will assist farmers with the other challenges that have been raised. “We will assist farmers especially those who are at a subsistence level and those who are at an emerging level. We want to assist all farmers in KwaZulu-Natal as a whole especially those who are in rural areas to contribute in the economic sector of agriculture,” adds Zikalala.
