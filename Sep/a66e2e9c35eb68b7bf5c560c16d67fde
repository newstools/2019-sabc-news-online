The South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) secretary-general, Joe Kokela, has encouraged workers in the banking sector to report for duty on Friday. This follows a Labour Court judgment which has interdicted Sasbo’s planned nationwide protest. The court found that the union did not comply with Section 77 of the Labour Relations Act which gives workers the right to embark on a protected strike. Kokela says Sasbo will seek leave to appeal the court judgment and resubmit a new notice to National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). “So we have to encourage our members as a responsible Federation … we’ll be back in the street with the same anticipation we wanted to take tomorrow.”
