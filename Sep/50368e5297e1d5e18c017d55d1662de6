Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has rejected claims circulating on social media of corruption in the judiciary. The Chief justice was addressing a media conference in Midrand, Johannesburg on Friday.

He says such serious claims need to be backed up with hard facts. This follows claims of a list of judges who allegedly received cash from the CR17 campaign.  Watch briefing:
