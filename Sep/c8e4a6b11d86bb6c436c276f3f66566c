Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and South African Society of Banking Officials (Sasbo) say they will seek leave to appeal a judgment by the Labour Court which stopped Fridayâ€™s planned strike by workers in the banking sector. Cosatu Deputy Secretary-General Solly Phetoe said the union will also resubmit a section 77 notice to the National Economic Development Labour Council (NEDLAC). Sasbo members are demanding an end to retrenchments in the banking sector, digitalisation and the high salaries executives are earning. He also encouraged workers to report for work on Friday. Business Unity South Africa (Busa) applied for an urgent interdict to stop the strike action. It argued that the delayed period between the notice to the NEDLAC and the protest action date did not satisfy the requirements of a protected action.
