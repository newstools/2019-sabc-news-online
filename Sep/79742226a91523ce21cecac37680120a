Former SABC board chairperson, Dr Ben Ngubane, says the public broadcaster was under serious financial strain when he was appointed. He was the chair of the SABC’s board from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela made damning findings in her report titled, When Governance and Ethics fail. Ngubane has been accused of supporting former SABC COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng – who was implicated in Madonsela’s report regarding mismanagement at the public broadcaster. Testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, Ngubane says he attempted to put measures in place to reduce costs at the SABC. “I am trying to show you that the SABC we came to was under serious financial stress. But we also had the conditions of the government guarantee. We had to produce a turnaround strategy and plan, reduce headcount by almost a 1 000 people, put in measures that reduce costs and benefits going to senior and middle management. This cost us about R200 million.” Click video below for more:
