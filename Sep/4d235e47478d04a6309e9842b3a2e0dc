Metrobus in Johannesburg has apologised to it’s commuters for service disruptions as a result of an industrial action by its workers. The strike is by the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa(DEMAWUSA). The Union is demanding salary progression for experienced employees and office space to be allocated to the union in all three Metrobus depots. Metrobus’ Goodwill Shiburi says: “Our mandate as the city of Johannesburg is to ferry passengers from A to Z. Especially those that have prepaid tags for the month.” “We apologise because we are unable to do that. Eighty percent of our employees are on duty unfortunately we had threats that made it impossible for the rest of the workers to work. As a result, our passengers are suffering and we are unable to carry out our mandate as Metrobus.”
