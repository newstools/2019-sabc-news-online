Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC )Parliamentary leader Mzwanele Nyontsho will lay charges against his party rival Narius Moloto for alleged defamation of character. In a social media post seen by the SABC News Moloto refers to Nyontsho as” former apartheid police informer and currently an agent of the system which is used to destroy the party”. Nyontsho says he will approach the courts this week to file a defamation case against Moloto. “I will lay a charge against Narius for calling me a former spy and a state agent, because remember, so many died because of these allegations before. And so many people were killed for being wrongfully accused for being spies. And you can’t lead a revolutionary organisation with such serious allegations against you. So, if he has a proof, he must come and prove it. Truth is he is expelled and he is no longer a PAC member. That one is true.” Nyontsho has already met his lawyers in Pretoria on Friday night. Attempts by SABC News to get a response from Moloto were unsuccessful. WATCH BELOW:
