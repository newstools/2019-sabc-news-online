Political analyst Khaya Sithole says some African National Congress (ANC) alliance partners are rejecting Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s economic strategy due to fears that it might trigger further unemployment in the country. Mboweni released the economic blueprint in August. However, the SACP and COSATU have strongly criticised the plan saying they were not consulted before its release. Mboweni has also maintained that government should sell some ailing state owned enterprises. Political analyst Khaya Sithole says:”He’s talking about this, he’s having the conversation at the wrong time so of course no political party is going to champion any restructure that says we going to cut 6000 to 10 000 jobs just when you’ve got the highest unemployment on record in the country.” “The problem here is how do actually implement some of these reforms without actually accelerating a pre-existing crisis and this is why you’re going to see the resistance coming from the other social partners.” Related video click below:
