The Moqhaka municipality in the Free State says it will continue to honour former African National Congress (ANC) president, Zaccheus Mahabane for his commitment to the movement. Mahabane led the ANC from 1924 to 1927. The municipality’s mayor Lucky Phooko and his entourage visited the grave site of the stalwart as part of Heritage Month celebrations that come to an end on Monday. Mahabane’s grave has been identified as a national heritage site. “We value the contribution which Mahabane has given to the people of South Africa, the people of Kroonstad, the people of Maokeng. We also wanted to do that as a demonstration of appreciation to the family for them giving their own grandfather, father to ask the people for him to work for the liberation of our movement generally,” says Phooko.
