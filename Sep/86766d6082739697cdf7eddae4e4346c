Zimbawean President Emmerson Mnangagwa says his country is grieving at the passing of founding father and late former President Robert Mugabe. He made the comments on Wednesday afternoon at Harare’s international airport where he received the body of Mugabe from Singapore. Mugabe, aged 95, died last week Friday in the Asian country where he had been receiving medical attention. Mnangagwa expressed his condolences to former First Lady, Grace and the Mugabe family. “The entire nation of Zimbabwe, our people are aggrieved and are in mourning because the light that led us to independence is no more. But his works, his ideology will continue to guide this nation. May I take this opportunity that on the day we lay him to rest on Sunday I appeal to you to show your love.” Mugabe’s body will be laying in state on Thursday at the Rufaro Stadium in the capital.
