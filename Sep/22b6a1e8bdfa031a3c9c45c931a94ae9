Public sector labour unions in the Kingdom of eSwatini have embarked on a strike to force government to heed their demands for a 7.25% salary hike. The civil servants are claiming that since 2016 government has not given them a salary increase, citing financial difficulties. The unions will hand over their petition to the Public Service Department in the capital Mbabane on Wednesday. Deputy General-Secretary of the Trade Union Congress of Swaziland, Muzi Mhlanga says workers in Eswatini have lost 15% on their salaries due to inflation. He says, “Since Monday, public sector members are on strike, but today they have decided to converge in the capital city, Mbabane, where they are going to deliver a petition, late in the week. Last week, the government started a process calling the union emergency meeting, where, when they got there, they were told that the government is offering 3%. This will depend if the economy will recover and the 3% will be offered with effect as of April 2020.”
