Commuters should expect a return to their regular commuting patterns as the Metrobus strike has been suspended. The Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa ( Demawusa)’s  Dion Makhura says the resolution was made in a three-hour meeting on Monday. The union downed tools for six days over salary progression issues and a lack of union office space at Metrobus depots. “Our members are going back to work tomorrow (Wednesday). We are battling with the finances to go to work every day, that’s the first issue why we are suspending the strike. We have realised that our enemy is not only Metrobus. It is a broader fight which also includes the City of Johannesburg but when we come back, it will be a disaster,” says Makhura explaining the reasons behind the suspension.
