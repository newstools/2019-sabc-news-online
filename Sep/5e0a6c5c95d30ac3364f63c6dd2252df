The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has put its support behind former Mayor of eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, Zandile Gumede. The league’s President, Bathabile Dlamini said it’s disappointing that women continue to be pushed back in the African National Congress (ANC) and greater society, just for being women. At a media briefing held Luthuli House in Johannesburg on Tuesday evening, Dlamini said, “We think there’s a very strong push-back against women who stand up for themselves. We are not going to stop what the Secretary of UN said this year in March, that we must push back the push-back. Secondly, we still believe that we all remain innocent until proven guilty. ” The party’s Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte, confirmed on Tuesday, at another media briefing, that the embattled Gumede had agreed to step down as mayor at the request of the KwaZulu-Natal ANC.
