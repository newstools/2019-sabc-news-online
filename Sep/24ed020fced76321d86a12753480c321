Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has warned that attacks on foreign nationals have a negative impact on ordinary South Africans. He was reacting to the recent spate of violent attacks on foreign nationals in Gauteng. At least 17 people were arrested, at least two people killed and five injured in renewed violence in the Johannesburg CBD last night. Speaking in Randburg, Johannesburg, Cele says last week’s violence left more South Africans dead than foreign nationals “We arrest people that burn, destroy, kill and injure other people. People are doing criminal things here regardless of checking who suffers. Last week, when the president gave the figure of ten, those people who died – 8 of them were South Africans and two were foreign nationals. So people suffer here, they suffer beyond their nationalities.” Click video below for more:
