University of Zululand students have walked out of their meeting with the KwaZulu-Natal Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Bheki Ntuli and chief Mandla Mkhwanazi. University management was not part of the meeting. Ntuli told the students that he would engage the Police Minister Bheki Cele to ask him to look at the issues that they had raised. Earlier, the students used stones and bottles to attack the police who were trying to gain access to the institution. The situation remains tense and police are monitoring the situation. On Monday, Police had to use teargas to disperse University of Zululand students who were trying to block the N2. Issues around safety are historical at the institution and criminals that terrorise students are allegedly known to authorities. Students say they will continue striking until all their demands are met and police are monitoring the situation. See tweet below:
