Former deputy President and the current Executive Director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, has called for a national emergency to be declared in South Africa over attacks on women. A string of recent attacks on women have sparked outrage across the country. Protestors clashed with police during a march at the Cape Town International Conference Centre, where the World Economic Forum for Africa is being held. Mlambo-Ngcuka says a state of emergency would release the much-needed funds to implement measures to protect women in the country. “We are in crisis in South Africa. A state of emergency would enable the President to take extraordinary measures to scale the interventions that are so much needed to fast track the implementation also of some of the policies and interventions that have already been agreed upon, we need extraordinary measures.” “We are not talking about the 21 days that sometimes is allowed in a state of emergency – we need resources to be allocated for these interventions to be properly executed, so that you can respond now before we lose too many and more lives.” Click video below:
