The poor state of South Africa’s economy is topping the agenda of the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee meeting in Benoni, east of Johannesburg. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says the meeting will also discuss Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Economic Growth Plan Discussion Paper. ANC alliance partners, the SACP and Cosatu,  have strongly criticised the document saying they were not consulted when Mboweni wrote it. However, many other sectors of society have welcomed the plan; saying it offers an indication of policies that could grow the economy and create jobs. Magashule says the ANC is as concerned as the rest of South Africa about the country’s economic crisis. “We will be discussing the economy. We’ll be discussing that document of comrade Tito. And we have invited everybody; from regions, province to national and some experts, so we will be discussing this document.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
