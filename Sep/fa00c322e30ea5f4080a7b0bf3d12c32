Defence Minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has commended the work done by the army on the Cape Flats. She says there has been great improvement in the policing of crime in Cape Town since the defence force stepped in. This despite the persistent alleged gang related killings. While Mapisa-Nqakula acknowledges recent killings, she says these are societal issues and challenges that must be addressed by educating children who struggle with substance abuse. “Soldiers are doing very well together with the police. Of course we should not believe, not once, that the presence of the soldiers will solve all the ills of the Western Cape. There’s been great improvement, but of course we also do know that there have been several incidents where people still have been killed. Only yesterday when we woke up, we heard that a woman was shot dead in her own house. The issue of gangs and young children who are joining gangs, they will continue to join gangs if they are dependent on drugs, substance abuse. We have to educate our children.” Click related video below:
