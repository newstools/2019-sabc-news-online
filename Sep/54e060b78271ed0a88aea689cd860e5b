African National Congress (ANC) NEC, member, Malusi Gigaba, has bemoaned that people who cause the loss of lives through road crashes receive less sentences in the courts of law. He was speaking during the memorial service to honour the late Mineral Resources and Energy Deputy Minister – Bavelile Hlongwa held at the University of Limpopo. A 46-year-old man whose truck plunged into a crash scene killing three people including Hlongwa last Friday night, will apply for bail in the Temba Magistrate’s Court in Hammanskraal north of Pretoria on October 15. Hendrik Britz is facing three charges of culpable homicide after the deaths of Hlongwa, Katlego Kekana and Sipho Malaka who were assisting another driver who had overturned at the Maubane Bridge near Carousel in Hammanskraal. Gigaba says, “How many other lives have been lost through car accidents where the drivers ran away [and] didn’t acknowledge their mistakes. And when they are caught, let me tell you, I know this from experience; the sentence is so extremely low you almost feel like the best way to commit murder is to hit someone by car. That’s how light the sentences are for people who’ve committed these types of murder.” Meanwhile, Limpopo’s African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) provincial secretary Che Selane has castigated the provincial mother body officials for having hatred towards former President Jacob Zuma. Selane accuses the officials of not attending the memorial service to honour Hlongwa as it was supposed to be addressed by Zuma. Zuma was however replaced by ANC NEC member Gigaba. The memorial service was held at the University of Limpopo. Selane says Hlongwa would not be happy about the conduct of the ANC officials. Click below for more…
