The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State says it will monitor provincial municipalities to ensure that they provide quality services to communities. The party is holding a local government forum with municipalities in Bloemfontein. ANC Provincial Chairperson, Sam Mashinini, says they also want to strengthen the financial management of municipalities. “To sit together with our municipalities in the province look at how best we can improve our audit in the province. As you know, in the municipalities, one of the big challenges that has been cited by the auditor-general is the finances. We are looking at that to come up with strategies and most important to ensure that these municipalities there is clear monitoring that such things, search results we don’t get them in the near future.”
