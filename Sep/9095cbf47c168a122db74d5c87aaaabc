Tshwane Metro Police have confirmed that seven people, including three children, died in a multi vehicle crash that has forced the closure of the N1 at Wallmanstall, north of Pretoria. Metro police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says nine cars and two trucks were involved. One of the trucks and some of the vehicles were gutted. Smoke from a veld fire appears to have contributed to the crash. Mahamba says 15 people were treated on the scene and another seven are in hospital. “We can confirm that seven (have been) confirmed dead, three of which are minors, four are adults. The road will remain closed while we are busy cleaning up the scene. All the vehicles have been recovered and we are saying now we confirm the number to seven.”
