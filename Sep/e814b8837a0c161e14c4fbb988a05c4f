Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says residents in the City can expect more efficient fire-fighting services. Mashaba has unveiled a new fleet of ten fire engines at the headquarters of the Metro Police in Martindale, west of the city.  The city is expected to receive five more before the end of 2019.  Even with these additions, the city still doesn’t have enough fire engines to respond adequately to emergency calls. It needs at least 104 fire engines to operate optimally. It only had 15 vehicles before the new arrivals, with only seven of those in good working condition. Mashaba is pleased that the new vehicles will boost their capacity. ‘It’s exciting news, particularly for our residents, particularly in the informal settlements where they do not really have appropriate fit for purpose vehicles so that we fight fires in those communities. So we are here to really celebrate the beginning of this journey; an unprecedented order of fire engines in any municipality in the history of South Africa. All in all, we’ve got 92 fire engines; we are going to be receiving in the next few months.”
