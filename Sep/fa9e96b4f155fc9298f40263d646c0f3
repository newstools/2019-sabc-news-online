The Gauteng Health Department says it will fill close to 2 000 vacant posts this financial year. These include doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dentist among others. Health MEC Doctor Bandile Masuku says they will create more posts in order to strengthen the province’s health system. He says the national health council has given them a directive to use money for human resource employment. “Any savings that we make anywhere in the system will be put into human resources to employ more staff because we need that part of the health system,” Masuku says. “Besides physiotherapists, we need to employ more dentists. Gauteng health hasn’t employed dentists in the past five years which is not something we are proud of.”
