The South African Communist Party (SACP) says it is not happy with the African National Congress’s (ANC) performance in many local municipalities. In an internal document drafted at the SACP’s special national congress – the party says it is now considering contesting the 2021 local elections alone, should its alliance partner fail to improve service delivery and governance. The SACP threatened to drop the ANC at this year’s general election but decided to support it closer to the date of the poll. Second Deputy General Secretary of the SACP Solly Mapaila says, “There is a deep concern all around, and I think South Africans are aware about that, particularly in critical metros and districts, that’s why we have ultimately lost several metros largely because of arrogance and poor service delivery.” WATCH
