The trial of eight men accused of killing nine people at the notorious Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi south of Durban is set to continue in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. On Tuesday a 43-year-old state witness implicated a police officer in an attack on a group of people at the hostel in August 2014. Police sergeant Bhekukwazi Mdweshu allegedly played a key role in the killings. The state alleges that he and his co-accused formed an association to control resident’s payments for accommodation at the hostel.  The state also alleges that the accused worked together to kill or eliminate people who threatened their control of the payments. All the accused have pleaded not guilty to all the 22 charges including murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder and racketeering.
