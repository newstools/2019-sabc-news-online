African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has accused so called “outside forces” of dividing the party with the intention to divide South Africa and, he claims, the continent. Magashule says what is happening in the country, is not xenophobia, but the work of those who seek reversing the success of a democratic South Africa. Magashule was speaking to Sasco members at Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria. As the students preparing for SRC Elections on Thursday, Magashule says they’ll continue to forge unity in the ANC and unite South Africa and the continent. “When Africa is united, we will never go to IMF, we’ll never beg US. They know that and that’s why they want to play what they did in the past, divide and rule. That’s why even now they are pushing tribalism.” Related video click below:
