The high-level team that President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed to investigate the recent violent attacks in which foreign nationals were targeted includes former presidents Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique. This emerged after the recent cabinet meeting. At least two foreign nationals were killed in the violence and businesses were looted and burnt. Meanwhile, International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor will on Friday morning meet with members of the African Diaspora in Pretoria. The meeting follows Pandorâ€™s commitment in her recent meeting with Heads of Missions accredited to Pretoria. It was agreed that continuous dialogue should take place with other stakeholder groupings. This is aimed at building bridges between South African citizens and migrants living in the country.
