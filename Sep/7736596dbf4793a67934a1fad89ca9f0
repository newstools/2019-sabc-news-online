President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for a national campaign to deal with gender-based violence in the country. He visited the family of slain University of Cape Town (UCT) student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, in East London. She was raped and murdered in a Cape Town post office, allegedly by an employee. Ramaphosa says the country will be tough on the perpetrators. “For far too long, we have relegated this scourge and cancer in our nation to the back and now it must come to the front; and now we want everyone to stand up and say we would bring an end to the gender based violence. We would deal with various aspects of gender based violence,” says Ramaphosa. The President also visited the families of boxer Leighandre “Baby Lee” Jegels and Angelique Clark-Abrahams in the city.
