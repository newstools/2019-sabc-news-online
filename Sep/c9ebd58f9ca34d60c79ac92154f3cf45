Sibanye-Stillwater has announced its intention to retrench more than 5 000 workers at its Marikana mine in the North West. Sibanye-Stillwater says that it will enter into consultation with the relevant stakeholders in terms of the Section 189 process. Spokesperson for Sibanye, James Wellsted says the retrenchment process follows a detailed three-month review of the Marikana operation and that the unfortunate job losses are necessary in order to ensure the sustainability of the mine’s operation. “This follows ongoing financial losses experienced at these operations with certain shafts having reached the end of their economic reserve lives. The company and affected stakeholders will together consider other measures to avoid and mitigate further retrenchments and seek alternatives to the potential closing or downscaling of operations.” “The restructuring will result in a more sustainable business, which is able to secure employment for the majority of the Marikana workforce of approximately 22 000 people and benefit other stakeholders in the area for a much longer period.”
