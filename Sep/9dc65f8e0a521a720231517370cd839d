Maluti Phiri from the Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa says refugees seeking to have their papers processed at the Desmond Tutu Refugee Reception Centre in Marabastad in Tshwane encounter a lot of challenges. The Home Affairs facility offers documentation services to asylum seekers and refugees in Gauteng. The facility was relaunched in 2017 because of the negative publicity it had encountered previously.Â However it seems as if not much has changed as corruption and backlogs continue. Speaking on Morning Live, Phiri says people stand in long lines from 3am until late in the evening and even that is not a guarantee their papers will be processed. She says applications must be processed within six months, but people can wait up to two years. She says people remain undocumented at no fault of their own. Watch full interview below:
