Members of the Banking Association of South Africa (BASA) say they are taking the necessary precautions to minimise any disruption and inconvenience customers may face ahead of the  strike by Cosatu and its affiliate, SASBO on Friday. The Association announced in a statement that banks will be operating as normal on the day. However, in case of any unavoidable disruptions at branches, bank customers should as far as possible make use of digital banking services. BASA says banks will be carefully monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of their customers and staff. Meanwhile, Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) says it will seek to stop the strike. BUSA says Fridayâ€™s labour action may not have satisfied the requirements for it to be legal. The Nedlac notice was first issued in August 2017 and BUSA says it should not be relied-on in 2019. It says the matter is scheduled to be heard in court on Wednesday. Related Video Below:
