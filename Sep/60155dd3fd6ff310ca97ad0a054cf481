The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) will on Friday elect a new president. It is unclear if Joseph Mathunjwa and other national leaders will retain their positions as the union’s three-day congress ends. The congress will also adopt the union’s constitutional amendments and give feedback on the congress resolutions. AMCU has over the past year been on the receiving end of bad publicity, this after the Registrar of Labour Relations threatened to de-register the union. This week the president of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU), Zwelinzima Vavi, lashed out at the African National Congress (ANC) and a capitalist system that he says is systematically weakening unions across the country. Vavi called for unions to unite in the wake of the new labour laws which he says will make unions redundant.
