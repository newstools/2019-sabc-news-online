On the first-ever World Patient Safety Day on 17 September 2019, the  World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global campaign to create awareness of patient safety and urged people to show their commitment to making healthcare safer. The campaign aimed mobilize patients and their families, health workers, policy makers, academicians, researchers, professional networks and the healthcare industry to speak up for patient safety. Globally, 134 million adverse events contribute to 2.6 million deaths each year due to unsafe care.  !function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");
