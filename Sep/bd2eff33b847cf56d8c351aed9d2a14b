KwaZulu-Natal police have urged communities not to take the law into their own hands after seven suspects were arrested for the murder of a man at KwaMaphumulo, on the north coast. The men are expected to appear in court soon on charges of murder and attempted murder. Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane says more arrests are expected. He says the seven were arrested following the attack on two men accused of being involved in criminal activities in the area. The first victim was severely assaulted and taken to hospital for treatment. Another man was then pointed out by the mob. He was also assaulted and died on the scene. Zwane says: “Communities must not take the law into their own hands but should hand the suspects over to the police.”
