Gauteng Premier David Makhura has appointed a commission of inquiry into the ongoing taxi violence in the province. The commission will investigate the underlying causes and identify people behind the killings in the taxi industry. The commission will be chaired by retired Judge Jeremiah Shongwe. The taxi industry transports about 75% of commuters in the province each day. Government spokesperson in Gauteng, Thabo Masebe says Premier Makhura has given the commission six months to conduct its investigation, submit a report to him and make recommendations. The commission will start within the next few days.
