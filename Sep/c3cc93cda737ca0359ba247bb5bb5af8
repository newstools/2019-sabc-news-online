The National Assembly Rules Committee is meeting on Tuesday to discuss procedures that have to be followed to remove office bearers of State Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy. It will also discuss the Sub- Rules Review Committee report on the Physical removal of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MPs from the chamber during the Public Enterprises Budget vote debate. The removal of office bearers of institutions supporting constitutional democracy is provided for in the constitution and other processes are outlined in legislation. Such removal processes must be done through Parliament. However, the procedures to remove such office bearers are currently not included in the National Assembly Rules. Parliament says Tuesdayâ€™s meeting will discuss how to develop procedures which should be incorporated into the rules on how to remove office bearers of state institutions supporting constitutional democracy. These office bearers include the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane who is the one currently facing possible removal from office. Meanwhile the Sub-Rules Review Committee is also expected to present its report to the Rules Committee on the incident involving some EFF MPs and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan during the Budget vote debate a few months ago.
