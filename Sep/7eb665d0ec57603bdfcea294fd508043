The South African Airways (SAA) says it has appointed executives in key critical positions to assist the embattled airline. SAA was responding to the South African Airways Pilots Association’s (SAAPA) threats of a strike. The association has handed over a list of demands including the appointment of a CEO in 90 days’ time. SAA has expressed disappointment at the pilots’ move. The airline’s spokesperson, Tlali Tlali says, “The position SAAPA adopted, including threats to embark on industrial action is contrary to meaningful engagement and progress we are making. Threats to embark on industrial action have a potential to hurt the airline’s commercial interests.” “The Board and management have taken visible and practical steps to enable recovery and sustainability for the business as soon as possible. Measures implemented include the appointment of executives in key critical positions. We have appointed CEOs for two of our subsidiary entities being Mango Airlines and SAA Technical,” explains Tlali.
