The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has dismissed reports of a nationwide taxi shutdown on Monday. Santaco says there has been a statement circulating on social media alleging a nationwide shutdown with intentions to kill foreign nationals. The taxi council says the message is fake and expressed concerns that such messages cause unnecessary panic and fear. Santaco President Phillip Taaibosch says the fake media statement aims to escalate the violence in the country. He also called on all taxi owners and drivers to refrain from taking such a call seriously.
