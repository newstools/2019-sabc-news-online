Two women and a man have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping of six-year-old Amy-Lee de Jager. They were nabbed at their homes in Vanderbijlpark on the Vaal on Wednesday night. De Jager was kidnapped on Monday morning outside the Kollegepark Primary School in Vanderbijlpark as she was being dropped off by her mother.  She was released unharmed by her kidnappers during the early hours of Tuesday morning. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo says one of the female suspects is known to Amy Lee’s parents. We are satisfied that we have the three main people responsible for the kidnapping of Amy Lee behind bars but the possibility of more arrests being effected cannot be ruled out. We appeal to anyone who has information on crime to please contact our Crime Stop number 086 00 10111. Callers may remain anonymous and all information will be treated with strictest confidence. “All three suspects are currently in police custody on a charge of kidnapping and they are expected to appear in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court on Friday before the close of business.  We cannot rule out the possibility of the arrest of more suspects as investigations progress,” adds Naidoo.
