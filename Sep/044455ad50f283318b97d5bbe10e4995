The troubled Maluti-a-Phofung municipality in Qwaqwa in the Free State has finally managed to elect executive mayor, speaker, and chief whip after being dysfunctional for more than a year. Masechaba Mosia was  elected as the new executive mayor of the Free State town. Tumelo Thebe was elected as speaker and the chief whip is Betsi Mofokeng.  All elected councillors are from the ANC. The newly-appointed executive mayor has promised that service delivery will be rendered. “ We will make sure that there’s service delivery in the Maluti-A-Phofung. Our people have been complaining a lot. They will now receive services,” says Mosia.
