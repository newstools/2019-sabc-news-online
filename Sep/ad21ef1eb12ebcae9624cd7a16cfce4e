African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) leader Kenneth Meshoe says the increase in violent crimes reported in the 2018 and 2019 national police crime statistics speaks to the failure of the South African Police Service to fight crime optimally. Meshoe was reacting to the release of the crime statistics for this period. He says the significant rise in contact crimes may be the reason why people take the law into their own hands, including the violence towards foreign nationals. “We are appalled. We are appalled. We are shocked and disappointed that contact crimes have increased. This explains why the citizens take the law into their own hands because the police have failed. This could be again why people turn their anger to foreign nationals because the police have failed to do their jobs. The police now must accept that they have failed South Africans.” Click on the video below:
