The Democratic Alliance has laid criminal charges against Gupta-linked companies and some former Eskom executives over the alleged awarding of fake Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) certificates. The charges follow findings by the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Commission that Gupta aligned companies used fraudulent BEE certificates to secure contracts and payments from Eskom. The party laid charges against Gupta-linked Tegeta, Optimum and Trillian for misrepresentation of their BEE status and for providing false information to Eskom. Among those implicated is former Eskom Chief Financial Officer Anoj Singh.
