The Labour Court has ruled that the banking strike cannot go ahead. Members of the public have been anxiously waiting for Thursday morning’s ruling on an urgent interdict to prevent Friday’s South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo)’s planned nationwide strike from going ahead. Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) brought the urgent interdict in the Labour Court in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Sasbo members are demanding an end to retrenchments in the banking sector, digitalisation and the high salaries executives are earning. On Wednesday, BUSA argued that the period between the notice to the National Economic Development Labour Council (NEDLAC) and the protest action did not satisfy the requirements of a protected strike. BUSA says that the NEDLAC notice which was first issued in August 2017, should not be relied on in 2019. Sasbo general secretary Joe Kokela says they have prepared an appeal if the court does not rule in its favour. He says the planned protest action this Friday is against thousands of retrenchments in the banking sector, and also against exorbitant salaries paid to banking executives.
