The South African Communist Party (SACP) says the Parliamentary process to look into the fitness of the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to hold office should be done in a fair manner. The Justice Portfolio Committee earlier gave the green light for the process. The portfolio committee, however, decided that rules need to be developed for the removal of the Public Protector or any other leader of a Chapter Nine institution first. The SACP has been at the forefront of a campaign to remove Mkhwebane from office – accusing her of incompetence. The Party’s spokesperson Alex Mashilo says they hope the process will run smoothly. “The Public Protector has to be held to account for the damning findings arrived at by our courts of law. Parliament must perform its work, but that work must be performed in terms of fair procedures and its conclusion must be substantively fair – that work has to take place and we welcome it.” Click on the related video below:
