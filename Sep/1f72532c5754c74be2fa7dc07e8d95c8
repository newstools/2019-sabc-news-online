President Cyril Ramaphosa says men who abuse women have no place in society. The President is addressing thousands of people who have converged outside Parliament, dressed in black, calling for an end to gender based violence. The protest follows the murder of University of Cape Town (UCT) student, 19-year-old Uyinene Mrwetyana and University of Western Cape (UWC) student Jesse Hess. Ramaphosa says harsher laws must be put in place to address the scourge. “We are going to be addressing the issue of the harsh penalty, so that the men who violate women, who rape women, and who kill women must stay in jail for life.” Mrwetyana’s body was found in Lingelethu West in Khayelitsha last Monday after she’d gone missing for more than a week. A 42-year-old man allegedly confessed to murdering the UCT student. The President says he will visit the family of Uyinene Mrwetyana on Friday.
