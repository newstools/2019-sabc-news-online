Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande has condemned the destruction of property during recent student protests at the University of Zululand. A satellite police station in KwaDlangezwa was torched – allegedly by protesting students.  The uprisings were in response to high levels of crime against students at off-campus residences. It was sparked by the shooting of a 23 year old student during a robbery at his off-campus residence. Briefing the media after meeting with the University Council, Nzimande called for effective policing at the institution. “I, however, wish to condemn in the strongest possible terms the destruction of property in our institutions. This can only serve to deprive future generations of the much-needed infrastructure.  I also condemn the destruction of property in nearby schools and disruptions of tests and exams at those schools, we call on the minister of police and the criminal justice system to ensure that there is effective policing in and around our campuses.” WATCH the full media briefing below:  Last week,  Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the satellite police station that was burnt allegedly by some students. Cele emphasized that criminality will not be tolerated in South Africa. He told the students that the police will deal with those criminals. “It’s like if you burn state institutions you are a criminal and must be dealt with like one. You can’t burn down the only police station you have just because you want another one, so they must carry on and come report to this police station with ashes, we will not build another one. There are many places in this country that want police stations,” Cele told the student.
