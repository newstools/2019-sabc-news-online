Convicted South African drug mule, Nolubabalo Nobanda arrives this evening at the Port Elizabeth airport in the Eastern Cape. She earlier touched down at OR Tambo International in Johannesburg. Nobanda was arrested in 2011 at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport after authorities found her smuggling 1, 5 kilos of cocaine in her dreadlocks. Nobanda told Thailand authorities that she had been hired to deliver the drugs to a customer at a hotel in Bangkok. Nobanda was initially sentenced to 30 years in prison, which was first halved and then reduced by two-and-a-half years in May. After Nobanda’s release from prison, she was moved to an Immigration Detention Centre, from where she underwent more administrative processing, before she could return to the country. Eastern Cape and Family lawyer Matthew Mpahlwa says she has already been welcomed by her family at the OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg and is expected to arrive at the Port Elizabeth airport on Thursday evening.
