The much anticipated 10-day royal tour of Southern Africa kicks off in Cape Town on Monday. Some details are shrouded in secrecy, presumably because of security concerns. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will on Monday visit a Cape Town township and District Six. Later in the week, they will call-on Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his wife Leah. The District Six Working Committee has called on Britain’s Prince Harry to acknowledge the pain suffered by residents who were forcibly removed from the area by the apartheid government in the 1960s. The committee represents more than 3 000 families who are fighting to return to their homes. Chairperson of the committee Shahied Ajam says: “We have no problem with him going to Bo Kaap and to the museum. We have no problem with him going to the Home-coming Centre but we would love for him to come to District Six to see that vacant land, to start experiencing that pain.” “He must realise the pain that we have, and he must also realise the devastation on the Cape Flats and what apartheid has done to us socially and economically.” Meanwhile,  Capetonians have expressed mixed feelings about the royal visit. One resident says: “It is nice to show some respect for this country and for the people so they are welcome in Cape Town.” “Are you serious, I didn’t know, I have no interest at all. He doesn’t pay my rent,” says another resident.
