African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule maintains that consequence management will in future be strictly applied to its deployees at local government level. Magashule has briefed the media in Benoni, on Gauteng’s East Rand, where the ANC National Executive Committee is holding a special meeting. Magashule says recklessness by ANC members who are municipal officials can’t be tolerated anymore and they’re going to closely monitor developments at all municipalities in the country. “We were actually talking about consequence management. You don’t do what is expected of you, and obviously there must be action because the communities can’t cry forever. Especially, for quality services in municipalities.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
