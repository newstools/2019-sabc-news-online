The driver of the bakkie in which 10 people were killed when it overturned in Cape Town on Saturday is under police guard in hospital. It was initially thought that the driver fled the scene and a manhunt was launched. It has since emerged that he is among the injured in hospital. Thirteen people were seriously injured in the crash and are being treated at Groote Schuur Hospital. One of the injured pointed the driver out to the police. The crash happened on Ou Kaapse Weg between Muizenberg and Noordhoek in the South Peninsula. Police Spokesperson Andre Traut says an investigation is ongoing. The vehicle is believed to have had faulty brakes and handbrake.
