The Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to speak out against the current violence in Gauteng. Maimane says it’s a shame that the looting and vandalism happening in Tshwane and Johannesburg don’t seem to worry the President. Maimane who was addressing the media in Johannesburg says South Africans elected him as the country’s first citizen in order to take the lead in such situations. “He must comes out of hiding and break his silence on the unfolding social and economic crisis.” “The elections took place and gave us a new President. It’s not that he must hold office, it’s time for him to come out strongly and lead in this time and this moment.” Click video below:
