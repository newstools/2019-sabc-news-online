Johannesburg Metrobus says should the strike by employees affiliated to labour union DEMAWUSA continue, they will be forced to implement disciplinary action against those employees who fail to report for duty. The strike has now entered it’s sixth day and has left thousands of commuters stranded in and around Johannesburg. Metrobus resumed their services Monday morning, however not at full capacity. Metrobus spokesperson Goodwill Shivuri says the no work no pay principle will continue until employees return to work. He says: “The no work, no pay principle continues. As we move towards the holidays,  unfortunately they will have to deal with a situation where they don’t have enough money.” “If the situation continues, we will also activate our internal processes to ensure that everybody comes to work. Ours is not to penalise or punitive measures. It is to ensure that all employees are back at work and we are operating a full services.” DEMAWUSA employees are striking over salary progression issues. The union also wants to be given office space and resources in all three Metrobus depots in Johannesburg. Related video below
