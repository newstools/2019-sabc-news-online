The Temba Magistrateâ€™s Court north of Pretoria has sentenced the Hammanskraal serial rapist, Tshepo Mokwena, to four life sentences. Mokwena has 14 days in which to appeal the sentences. Mokwena attacked and raped young and old women using the Babelegi Bridge between 2006 and 2014. He was arrested after being on the run for seven years. Magistrate Edmond Humphreys described him as heartless and someone who deserves to be completely removed from society. One of his victims, Dineo Makhubela, says she feels relieved that Mokwena will be away forever.
