The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape is once again at loggerheads with its councillors who have defied the party. Five ANC Councillors, including a Mayor and a Speaker in the Phokwane Municipality in Hartswater are the latest to face a disciplinary hearing for voting with the opposition. Chairperson of the Frances Baard Region in Kimberley Wende Marekwa says the accused members colluded with the opposition to elect a Mayor and a Speaker that were not the Provincial Executive Committee’s (PEC) preferred candidates. “Councillors of the ANC have undermined the decision of the PEC. Some of them have connived to appoint their own Mayor with the opposition. The DC must take the matter forward and we will hear the outcome of the DC on the allegations levelled against the said councillors.”
