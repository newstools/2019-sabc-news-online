Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on all South Africans, black and white, to unite for the betterment of the country, across all spheres including the economy. He was in Soweto earlier on Tuesday as part of the Heritage Day celebrations, accompanied by the party’s provincial leadership of Gauteng. Maimane told hundreds of his party supporters, outside the Mandela National museum at Vilakazi Street in Orlando West, that for South Africa to celebrate Heritage Day, all citizens must enjoy the fruits of a prosperous economy. “If we are going to hand over a heritage of all South Africans, let’s build an economy that ensures that our citizens can prosper together and build one South Africa. How do you hand over a heritage to Sena Mmereko? We are here to say today we most reform our politics to also reform our economy so that more people are included. Then we can talk of a prosperous heritage for future South Africans,” says Maimane.  Maimane says part of growing the country is ensuring that South Africans own property. “We must ensure when we build an economy that works, that we make sure everybody owns property. You know party of the reason why section 25 was put in the constitution was because prior to 1994, black people were not able to own property,” says Maimane.
