The seven-year old girl who was raped in a toilet cubicle at a Dros restaurant in Pretoria will on Wednesday testify in the Pretoria High Court. She will be the first witness for the day.  The state confirmed that she will testify via CCTV. On Tuesday, the case has been adjourned after the state’s other witnesses were not available to testify. It is understood three more witnesses, including the child and her mother, will still testify for the state. A former childminder at the Dros Restaurant started crying while testifying about the emotional impact the incident had on her. The woman, who requested to remain anonymous, says she escorted the little girl to the toilet. When the girl didn’t come back, they went looking for her. The childminder, the mother and three waitresses pushed a door open. The woman told the High Court in Pretoria when the door opened, she saw the little girl with her skirt on but without her purple leggings. Nicholas Ninow had no shirt on, but his trouser zip was open. The woman testified through an interpreter she left her job a few months later because she couldn’t cope. “She said ‘I trusted you with my child’ and to me, it seems she put all her trust on me and now I’m the one that failed her. I was no longer coping; if I go to the toilet I feel scared. And then when I’m supposed to register the child, I was doubting myself that maybe the same thing will transpire again.”
