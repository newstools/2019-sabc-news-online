The parents of learners, who were raped allegedly by three members of staff at a school in eNgcobo in the Eastern Cape, say they fear that their children will be victimised at the school. It is alleged that between June and August, two teachers and a clerk from Bashe Junior Primary School would lure three boys to their homes, give them alcohol and then rape them. Their case has been postponed to the 27th of September by Dalasile Magistrate’s Court for bail hearing. Parents say this has affected their children’s self-esteem. “We will take them for medical examination. How are they going to grow up like men and how are we supposed to send our kids to that school when none of the school staff came to support us today. It is very difficult for them to go back to that school.” “We do not want those teachers to be around our children again because we don’t know what they might do to them again.” The Education Department Spokesperson, Malibongwe Mtima has urged learners to come forward if they are being victimised at their schools. “As the department, we are prepared to even dispatch an EDO who will go there and monitor that school on a daily basis because those educators who have allegedly done something wrong must face the wrath of the law. The kids can’t suffer because of that, because they did not ask that those educators do that. We want the names of those victimising our kids for reporting something wrong that has been done to them and they are going to face the wrath of the law.”
