The only functioning airport in the Libyan capital was closed on Sunday after being struck by artillery fire overnight. There were conflicting reports on the number of injuries at Mitiga airport. A media officer for the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) said four people had been wounded, including three haj pilgrims. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said four projectiles hit the civilian parts of the airport including a runway, resulting in damage to a plane carrying dozens of pilgrims and wounding two crew members. “These vicious attacks are designed to sow fear, create chaos and disrupt operations at the only working airport in the Libyan capital Tripoli,” it said in a statement. Nearby Mitiga hospital received one small girl who had been wounded, a doctor there told Reuters. Photos on social media showed a damaged passenger jet operated by Libyan Airlines. Some cars parked at the airport were also damaged, a Reuters witness said.
