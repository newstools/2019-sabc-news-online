Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says the gender based violence rampant in most parts of the province cannot be tolerated any longer. Winde and his wife Tracy joined the crowds outside Parliament on Thursday who were protesting against gender based violence. The brutal rape and murder of 19-year-old UCT student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, is among the crimes that have provoked national outrage. Winde says plans are afoot to deal with the scourge in the province. “I am here because we actually have to change things. We cannot allow things to carry on the way it is and I have committed that this provincial government will make sure that crime and especially gender based violence is crime which is our top priority.” Related video click below:
