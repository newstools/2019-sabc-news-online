The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) has appealed to the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to conduct more research on the proposed Grade 9 General Education Certificate.   It says the department should not be seen to be encouraging learners to leave school without proper support and resources.   This comes after Minister Angie Motshekga announced at the Sadtu elective conference in Nasrec, on Thursday, that grade 9 learners would receive a school leaving certificate to assist them to acquire technical skills.   Sadtu general secretary Mugwena Maluleke says, “There is a certificate that is proposed by the department of education at grade 9 which people misunderstood it as an exit certificate. It is an endorsement certificate for you to be able to branch into different levels of education like occupational, vocational technical or academic.” “However, go and make sure that we understand the modality, the policies and how we can address these particular issues because it can end up being a deliberate drop out campaign,” adds Maluleke.
