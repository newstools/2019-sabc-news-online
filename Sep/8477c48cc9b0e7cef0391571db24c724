The Department of Basic Education is working on formalising Grade 9 as one of the exit points of schooling. That means learners will be able to finish school at Grade 9 and attain a General Education Certificate. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshega revealed this at the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu’s) elective conference underway at Nasrec, Johannesburg. “Dealing decisively with the quality and efficiency through the implementation of standardised assessments to reduce failure, repetition, and drop-out rates, we are also working on the introduction of multiple qualifications such as the General Education Certificate before the Grade 12 exit qualification. The NDP aims for a ‘world-class assessment system’ involving reliable measures of learning for every primary school.” For more, watch the video below:
