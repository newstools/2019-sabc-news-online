Corruption Watch says the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) ruling that ordered Cash Paymaster Services (CPS ) to pay back an amount of R316 million to the South African Social Services Agency (SASSA) is a victory for accountability and good governance. CPS took the matter to the SCA after Corruption Watch successfully challenged the legality of SASSA’s payment in the Pretoria High Court in 2018. “We believe it vindicates the work that we have done to ensure that the payment of R316-million from SASSA to CPS is checked and there is accountability to ensure that such a payment that has been made unlawfully is not allowed to stand. At the moment we haven’t heard any indication from CPS but we would hope that this is the end of the rather sorted chapter in South African history. We will have to wait and see whether the is an appeal launched by the CPS,” says lawyer for Corruption Watch, Caroline James. Meanwhile, SASSA welcomed the  ruling on its multi million rand payment dispute with CPS. “The South African Social Security Agency welcomes the judgment handed down by the Supreme Court of Appeal. As an organisation we have taken the judgment to be studied by our legal section which aims to make sure that they advise us in terms of what action the organisation has to take with regards to certain aspects that affect SASSA in particular,” says SASSA spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi.
