Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku, says there are fewer people opposed to the National Health Insurance (NHI) than before. He says with more engagement and clarity on what the NHI entails, people are welcoming the new health financing system. He has been addressing stakeholders in the health sector at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital in Parktown. Government is planning on rolling out the new health system and it should be fully implemented by 2026. Masuku says, “Every time when you go out and engage on the universal health coverage, the NHI, you get different aspects all the time, things that you never thought about and things that you need to consider as we move forward as a country to implement the NHI. And I think what we’ve also observed Minister is that they’ve been a clear indication on how people now want us to take the NHI forward, so those who are opposing NHI are becoming less and less.” Watch a related video below:  Meanwhile, Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Health has called on the public to make either written or oral submissions on the National Health Insurance Bill. The aim of the Bill is to provide universal health care to all South Africans. Interested parties can write to the committee or indicate whether they want to make an oral submission. This must reach the committee by October the 11th.
