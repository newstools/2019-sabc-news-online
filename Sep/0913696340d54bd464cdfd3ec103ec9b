The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Chairperson of the Uthukela District Mbuzeni Mkhize has escaped unharmed after unknown persons shot at him at Weenen in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. Mkhize was on his way home from a party meeting when he was attacked on Sunday night. In August, the IFP councillor in the Uthukela District Municipality Mthembeni Majola was shot and killed by unknown people. “Yesterday (Sunday), we were having a meeting where we were thanking voters for voting for the IFP and we were also welcoming new members who were coming back to the party. We left the ceremony around 5 o’clock in the afternoon. Thereafter, we were shocked to hear the news that our District Chairperson, Comrade Mbuzeni Mkhize was attacked, but fortunately, he managed to escape the hail of bullets,” says IFP’s Regional Secretary Bhekokwakhe Majola.
