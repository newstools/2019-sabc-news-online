The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has called on the provincial health department to establish an internet site where families can identify the bodies of their loved ones. The party says more than 1000 bodies remain unidentified in government mortuaries. The DA says the largest number of unidentified bodies are at the Johannesburg mortuary followed by Germiston. The DA’s Jack Bloom says: “One possible solution is an internet identification site. The Gauteng Health Department has promised this for a long time.” “I think they should set it up. Relatives instead of going from mortuary to mortuary they can get access to this site and hopefully they can identify their loved ones.”
