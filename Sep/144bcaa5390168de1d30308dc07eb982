Former President Robert Mugabe was finally buried at Kutma Zvimba in Zimbabwe. The burial service was a small and private event with only those close to the former veteran leader and members of the community in attendance.   Mugabe’s family gathered to pay their last respects and celebrate his life. The government of Zimbabwe had earlier announced that he will be buried at the Ntional Heroes Acre in Harare and a special shrine was supposed to be built. It was expected that it will take 30 days to build the shrine. On Thursday, Mugabe’s body was transported to Kutma  by the military. The spokesperson of the family Leo Mugabe says it was the former president’s wish to be buried at Kutma in Zvimba and the family was fulfilling that. The veteran leader died in a Singapore hospital a few weeks ago, aged 95. His death comes after almost two years after a military coup ended his 37-year rule. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
