Police are yet to confirm the nationalities of one person who has died and five others who were wounded following renewed violence in the Johannesburg CBD on Sunday afternoon. Police have confirmed that the deceased died in hospital after being stabbed. Earlier, some hostel tenants disrupted the former IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi who was trying to curb attacks in which foreign nationals and their businesses were being targeted. Police have confirmed that some hostel tenants have been inciting the violence. Sixteen people have been arrested. Police spokesperson, Kay Makhubela says, “After the protest erupted, we sent other officers to the hospitals and clinics to check if there are any injured persons. We discovered that we had about five people who were reported injured and there was one death earlier – the person was stabbed with a sharp object. We are investigating a case of murder and the other ones will be assault and attempted murder.” Meanwhile, more than 20 people have been arrested in Malvern, east of Johannesburg, following renewed violence in the area. A week ago, shops were burnt and looted. Similar incidents occurred in Tembisa, Turffontein and Jeppestown about a week ago. Click related video below:
