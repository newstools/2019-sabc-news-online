The South African Society of Bank Officials (SASBO) has advised members of the public to withdraw money and fill up their tanks on Thursday. Over 40 000 members of the finance union which is affiliated to Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) are expected to down tools against retrenchments in the banking sector.   SASBO general-secretary Joe Kokela says the country must prepare for a total shutdown of banking services. “The total shutdown speaks to anything and everything that has got to do with banking in this country; it will come to a standstill. The ATM might also not be working on the day of the strike and even those who are using the swipe machines, those machines might not be working.” “We are appealing to the people, especially the motorists that they better make sure that on Thursday they fill up their tanks. We are appealing that they withdraw enough cash on Thursday,” adds Kokela. Meanwhile, Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) has applied for an interdict to halt the strike. That case will be heard on Wednesday.
