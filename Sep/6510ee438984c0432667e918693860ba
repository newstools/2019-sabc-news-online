The family of the slain East London boxing and karate champion, Leighandre “Baby-Lee” Jegels says it will seek legal advice on the circumstances around her death after her funeral. She was murdered by her police ex-boyfriend, Bulelani Mnyaka, on her way to the gym two weekends ago. She was with her mother, Ryta who survived the shooting. In an exclusive interview with the SABC News, the family says it’s still trying to come to terms with their daughter’s untimely death. “She was in big trouble… when she went to get the protection order we thought we were done . “This guy threatened her prior, and he said he will kill her and himself after. He said if he cant have her no one will,” says Baby Lee’s father, Ensil Jegels. Jegels says they won’t rest until someone is held to account. “We are going to to seek legal advice as to what to do, because like my wife has said, if they taken action through the protection order. I mean it speaks for itself… Leighandre would have been alive.”  Watch video below:
