A 32 year old man accused of killing his partner is on Monday expected to appear at the KwaMhlanga Magistrate’s court in Mpumalanga. Police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says the body of the victim was discovered a few days after the murder. The 32 year old woman’s body was found stuffed in a steel case. Investigations led the police to the arrest of the man who was found in Limpopo. Hlathi says the suspect is being investigated for other serious offences.
