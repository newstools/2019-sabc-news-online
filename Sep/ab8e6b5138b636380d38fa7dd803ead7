The National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi, has dismissed allegations that she was among those who received money from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC leadership campaign. This follows reports of leaked bank statements that allegedly provide details on donors for President Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign. Batohi’s name has surfaced with allegations that she received over R1 million from the campaign in March 2018. Batohi says these reports are attacks against her. “It’s a lie. I don’t know why people do this and I don’t want to speculate about it and I will not be distracted by it. I think these are tactics to try to distract you from doing your work. This is the start of it; there’s going to be a lot more and I realise I have to fortify myself against these attacks. When I was interviewed, I said this is a shark tank and it seems like the attacks have started, but this will not distract us from our important work.” WATCH BATOHI’S MORNING LIVE INTERVIEW BELOW:
