The women of OR Tambo District in the Eastern Cape are to hold a Women’s Dialogue with President Cyril Ramaphosa in Lusikisiki on Monday. The President is to engage with the community on gender-based violence and killing of people with albinism. He is expected to launch his District Coordinated Service Delivery Development Model, known as Khawuleza. The women will also voice their grievances which include the growing number of incidents of abuse and violence against women and children. There have been several cases affecting various villages of Lusikisiki and Flagstaff in the Ingquza Hill area. In the past two weeks there were five incidents which saw the rape of three women, including a six-year-old girl. Three others were killed. In most cases, the elderly women are killed on suspicion of practicing witchcraft. Hundreds of residents brought the town of Lusikisiki to a complete standstill last week, expressing disappointment and frustration. This, after the rape of a six year-old girl, allegedly by a 55-year-old man who’s believed to be a senior official of the Department of Education.
