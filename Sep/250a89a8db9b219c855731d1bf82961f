The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and party spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi will be hauled before the courts for allegedly assaulting a police officer. Malema and Ndlozi are accused of attacking a police colonel at the funeral service of struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in April 2018. The details of the NPA’s decision are contained in a document that has been circulating on social media on Friday, indicating that the two EFF leaders must be charged and prosecuted. The Gauteng NPA spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane, confirmed the NPA’s decision to prosecute Malema and Ndlozi. “The NPA in the Gauteng Local Division confirms the authenticity of the document that is circulating on social media platforms. Yes indeed it is a document that was drafted and signed by an NPA official and that decision has been communicated to the suspects and the complainants as required by the law.”
