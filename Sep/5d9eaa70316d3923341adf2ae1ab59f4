Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed appreciation to the South African government for its efforts in dealing with the recent violent attacks on foreign nationals. President Cyril Ramaphosa said this during his address to a special joint sitting of Parliament. Ramaphosa called the joint sitting to discuss crime against women and children. The President says he has spoken with his Nigerian counterpart. “Earlier today (Wednesday) I spoke to the former Minister Jeff Radebe who told me he was well received by the President of Nigeria, President Muhammed Buhari, who expressed a great respect for the effort we are taking to deal with this matter. But he also confirmed as he and I have agreed that yes he will be coming for a state visit in our country not withstanding what has happened and I really appreciated that .”  Ramaphosa says there is a need to create laws that will regulate how foreign nationals operate their businesses in South Africa. He says laws regulating businesses operated by foreign nationals would help in preventing conflict with locals. “We should consider as many countries have, the regulations that will regulate how people from other nations can operate businesses, how they can participate in businesses within the small and medium enterprises.”
