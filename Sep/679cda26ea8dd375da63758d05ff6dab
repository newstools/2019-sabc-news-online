The State Capture Inquiry will on Wednesday continue hearing evidence relating to the SABC. Former GCEO, Lulama Mokhobo and two members of the SABC 8 are scheduled to testify. On Tuesday, current Head of News Phathiswa Magopeni testified that when she took up her position, she found the news department in a state of decay. Mokhobo is expected to give clarity on abuse of power and improper conduct in a provisional report by the Public Protector for appointing the former Chief Operating Officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng. In 2016, eight journalists stood up in dissent against the censorship imposed by Motsoeneng and the capture of the newsroom and were dismissed from the organisation. A subsequent hearing at the Labour Court found the dismissals were unlawful and ordered the reinstatement of four of the full time SABC journalists. Watch a related video below:
