The bail application of three people arrested in connection with the kidnapping of Amy’Leigh de Jager will continue in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court in the Vaal on Friday morning. Amy Leigh was kidnapped earlier this month outside the Kollegepark Primary School as her mother was dropping her off. She was released unharmed by her kidnappers.  The state is opposing bail, arguing that the accused are a flight risk. The two women and man were arrested in their homes in Vanderbijlpark.  One of the accused, a teacher at Amy’Leigh’s school, was a close friend of the child’s mother.
