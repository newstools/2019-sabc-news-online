Businessman Reuel Khoza says matric should still remain the only point of exit in basic education. Khoza was speaking after delivering the 10th annual Eskia Mphahlele Memorial Lecture at the UNISA Polokwane campus on Friday night.   This year’s lecture focused on transformation in higher education with the hope of producing ethical leaders. Khoza says learners exiting school at grade nine need to be intellectually prepared. “Given an opportunity, I would suggest you only go vocational granted but after you have developed your brain sufficiently. I would say even that exit should be at matric and not at grade nine so there is a sense in which matric, in my humble submission, should still be the point of exit; but come tertiary education I would advocate combining practice with theory.” Click on related videos below:
