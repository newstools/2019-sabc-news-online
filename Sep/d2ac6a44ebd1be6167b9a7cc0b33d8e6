The Economic Freedom Fighters  (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has urged the authorities in Zimbabwe to put their differences aside to give the late President Robert Mugabe the funeral he deserves.  Malema was speaking at the memorial service organised by the EFF in Soweto on Thursday. ” Give an old man a dignified funeral, whatever the difference you had put them aside, let us bury the old man in a dignified way, because if it becomes anarchy, the enemy will be happy.” The service was attended by hundreds of EFF supporters and some members of Mugabe’s family.  The EFF chose to remember Zimbabwe’s former president Robert Mugabe as an African hero. Malema says Mugabe’s legacy should be preserved the same way many remember the likes of Nelson Mandela and Muammar Gaddafi. He also urged the people of Zimbabwe to unite in their time of grief.  Malema’s political career was inspired by Mugabe among others. He spoke fondly of Mugabe, who he said was prepared to host him in Zimbabwe when he was expelled from the African National Congress (ANC).   Meanwhile, Mugabe’s nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, said Mugabe died in a foreign land because his own organisation hated him.
