The Democratic Alliance  (DA) says it is escalating efforts to woo back voters. After a hammering in the national elections, the party continues to bleed support. It has lost at least eight wards in by-elections since May. The opposition party’s Federal Executive concluded a two-day meeting in Johannesburg. It says it is reflecting deeply on its showing at the polls. The DA’s performance in the May national poll was disappointing. Support dropped by over 2%, to 20,77% with smaller parties like the Freedom Front Plus gaining traction. This week it lost a further two wards in the North West to the African National Congress and the Freedom Front Plus. Watch the video below for more on the story:  The party says it is worried.  The DA has also thrown its weight behind its Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. This is despite allegations of corruption levelled against him regarding a “R1 billion ‘smart city’ tender.” The DA has also raised concerns over the crime statistics released earlier this week. With the 2021 local elections looming large, the DA says it will be holding a federal council meeting In October to discuss among others its electoral performance, and most likely a fight back strategy.
