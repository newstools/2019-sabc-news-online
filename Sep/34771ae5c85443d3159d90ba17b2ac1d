Ten people have been arrested during a protest against gender based violence in the Cape Town CBD. Thousands of people, mainly dressed in black, took to the streets; calling for an end to violence against women.  Officers fired stun grenades and used a water cannon in an effort to disperse crowds. The protest follows the murder of UCT student, 19 year old Uyinene Mrwetyana and UWC student Jesse Hess, among others. Police spokesperson, Andre Traut, says the ten protesters were arrested for public violence and assaulting police officers. “During the protest action today in the Cape Town CBD, a total of ten persons were arrested; eight for public violence and two the assault of a police officer. Once they have been charged, they will make a court appearance in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court.”
