In celebrating Heritage Day and promoting tolerance and social cohesion, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, in collaboration with Laerskool Schweizer Reneke, hosted a Legacy Walk in Schweizer Reneke in the North West to honour the late struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada. The school made headlines earlier this year following the circulation of a picture of black children separated in class from the main table of their white peers. The image sparked tense racial confrontations between white and black people in the area. “Something that did not get publicity is the very fact that uncle Kathrada was not allowed to attend that school and that forced him to go to Johannesburg and that tells us a story of where we were and where we are. Today we have a school that is non-racial, people of all races attending the school. Despite the negative publicity we have to remember where we come from,” says Chairperson of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation Derek Hanekom .
