Hurricane Humberto is expected to become a major hurricane with 178 kph winds by Tuesday night or early Wednesday, forecasters said, as the storm tracked towards Bermuda after strengthening early on Tuesday. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that Bermuda could be hit with tropical storm force winds and up to three inches of rain by Wednesday, and was at risk of life-threatening waves and tides. The center of the hurricane is expected to approach the archipelago Wednesday night, the NHC said, and current tracks show it side-swiping Bermudaâ€™s west coast Thursday. Packing 90 150 kph winds early Tuesday morning, Humberto was 920 km west of Bermuda, picking up speed and moving at 13 kph, the forecasters said. After gaining hurricane strength late Sunday, Humberto dropped another two inches of rain on the storm-ravaged North western Bahamas as it churned away from the US coast, the NHC said. It is bringing life-threatening waves and tides to parts of the US east coast from Central Florida to North Carolina and dangerous conditions will remain for the next few days, forecasters said.
