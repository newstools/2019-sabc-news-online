Nigerian nationals fleeing the recent wave of violence in Gauteng are now boarding a flight back home. The flight was delayed at the OR Tambo International Airport as officials were trying to verify their documents. An estimated 20 Nigerians including women and children have been turned back for not having the necessary documentation. A privately-owned airline has offered to transport those wanting to leave South Africa for Nigeria free of charge. Some Nigerian nationals are not happy that some have been left behind. “I don’t see the reason why they should not allow people to go.” “Even though there’s a document issue, I expect the Nigerian and South African immigration to settle it. It’s not supposed to affect people. This is not nice. We want to go back to our country.”
