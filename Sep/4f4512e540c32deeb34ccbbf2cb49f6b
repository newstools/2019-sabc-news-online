The International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor says she does not expect South Africa to receive any backlash from the 193 member states of the United Nations General Assembly, due to the recent violence in the country. Pandor says many countries are aware of the government’s efforts to tackle the violence. She was speaking ahead of South Africa’s participation in the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, to be held in New York. “And I will expect that South Africa will be treated in a proper manner given that as a government we haven’t done what’s been done by some countries on the continent, where hundreds have been expelled. Where there are illegal immigrants, we’ve tried to be humane in our efforts. Yes, there’s been this violence, but we’ve not behaved as other African governments, and those that did those things were not rejected by the international communities.” Meanwhile, Pandor has criticised the media’s role in the recent wave of attacks on foreign nationals. “I note the resistance in the media, which seems to find that something which is kept alive consistently even when respected actors on matters on Human Rights have said it is wrong to call South Africans xenophobic as a nation. But the events that occurred are concerning and we need to take steps.” Click below for more on the story:
