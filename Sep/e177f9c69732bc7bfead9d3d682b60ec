Mineral Resources and Energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, is expected to visit the family home of deputy minister in his department, Bavelile Hlongwa. Hlongwa was among five people who died on Friday night in a vehicle crash in Hammanskraal. Speaking to the SABC on Saturday, Mantashe described Hlongwa as energetic and brilliant. She has been hailed for being a bright, young leader who called for youth inclusion in national leadership. A steady stream of ANC leaders visited the Durban home of the late deputy minister Hlongwa on Saturday, among them Minister of Co-Operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Doctor Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma who was among the last to see Hlongwa alive on Friday night. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala and several MECs also paid their respects to Hlongwaâ€™s mother. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said that Hlongwa will receive an official provincial funeral.
