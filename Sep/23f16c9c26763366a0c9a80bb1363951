The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has condemned the looting of foreign-owned shops in Gauteng. This follows the widespread looting incidents across the province.   The party says it is against the violent attacks perpetrated by some South African citizens targeting foreign nationals. IFP chairperson in Gauteng, Bonginkosi Dhlamini, called on South Africans to desist from painting the country negatively. “We are calling upon South Africans to desist from painting our country negatively internationally. Yes, we agree that there are undertone issues that need to be addressed – issues of unemployment, bad service delivery. We are calling upon government to open up forums where we are really going to deal with these issues because it is wrong for South Africans to be difficult for them to open businesses, but it is easy for foreign nationals to do so. But that does not justify people taking the law into their own hands.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
