The family of Uyinene Mrwetyana, a University of Cape Town student who was murdered in a brutal attack has urged the justice system to take punitive measures against her alleged killer. The family of the 19 year-old woman from East London said they’re still struggling to come to terms with the loss. Her body was found in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats on Monday last week after she went missing for more than a week. A 42-year-old Post Office employee confessed to the murder. Family member, Nosipho Luvuno says they’re still hurting, “We were looking forward for her to go forward and further her studies. She was so humble and we are very sad about what happened and we don’t wish this to happen to anybody’s child. I would like the perpetrator to rot in jail because what he did to the child was very cruel.”
