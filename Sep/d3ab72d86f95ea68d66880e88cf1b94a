North West premier Job Mokgoro says government urgently needs skills to improve services to the people. He was speaking to academics at the South Africa UNESCO Engineering conference at the North West University’s Mahikeng campus. Over the years, government has been blamed for appointing people without skills to critical positions. This is said to be hampering the delivery of basic services. Mokgoro says the provincial government recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the university to help achieve its goal to address the skills shortage in government. “We are so desperate to address the question of skills shortages. We have an entity within government called Ikatisong School of Governance. And through that vehicle, we’re going to make sure that men and women who drive are appropriately qualified so that we really expedite development of skills. I’m also talking to business to say let’s work in partnership and make sure that we speed up the question of skills development.”
