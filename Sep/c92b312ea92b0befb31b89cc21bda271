KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) police say they have opened an inquest docket into the death of Durban woman Natasha Conabeer. Conabeer was found at the weekend dumped unconscious outside her house, after being reported missing three weeks ago. According to reports, the 23-year-old was then rushed to a Durban hospital where she received treatment in the ICU  but passed away. “We can confirm that a case of inquest is being opened for further investigations by the Durban North Police after we received information that a woman who has been allegedly reported missing has died at a Durban hospital. We are still waiting for post-mortem results to show us what really happened to her,” says KZN police spokesperson, Thulani Zwane.
