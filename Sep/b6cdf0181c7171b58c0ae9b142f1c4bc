National Council of Provinces (NCOP) delegates start their provincial week in the nine provinces from Monday but will have to return on Wednesday for a special Joint Sitting of Parliament called by President Cyril Ramaphosa. These are just some of the activities in Parliament, a week before the start of a two-week break from next week. National Assembly committees are also expected to continue with their usual oversight work this week. Parliament says three National Assembly plenary sittings are scheduled to take place this week. In one session on Tuesday, there will be a debate led by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, on building state capacity through in-sourcing of government and all state-owned company workers. On Wednesday, President Ramaphosa will address a joint sitting of Parliament on a new approach to tackle gender-based violence. Parliament says soon after the President’s address, Ministers in the Governance Cluster will answer oral questions in the National Assembly. The last plenary session this week will end on Thursday with the heritage debate under the theme “Celebrating South Africa’s literacy classics in the year of Indigenous languages”.
