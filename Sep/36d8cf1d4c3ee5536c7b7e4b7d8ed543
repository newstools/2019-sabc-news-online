Mineral Resources minister, Gwede Mantashe says the country has lost a brilliant, young mind, in the passing away of Bavelile Hlongwa. Thirty-eight-year-old Hlongwa died on Friday in a car crash which claimed the lives of four other people on the N1 from Polokwane. Hlongwa was one of the young appointments made by President Cyril Ramaphosa into his executive earlier this year. Mantashe says Hlongwaâ€™s strong academic background made her a force to be reckoned with. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/745151">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko says Hlongwa will be honoured with a provincial official funeral and flags will fly at half-mast in the country until Hlongwa is laid to rest.
