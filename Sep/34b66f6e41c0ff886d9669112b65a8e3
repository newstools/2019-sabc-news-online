The tourism sector in Gauteng is feeling the brunt from the recent violence and looting of businesses in the province. Since the wave of violence in the country there has been less tourists arriving and the Gauteng Tourism Authority has been fielding enquiries from concerned tourists with some cancelling their planned trips. Head of Destination Media and Communications at the Gauteng Tourism Authority Barba Gaoganediwe says businesses have recorded losses over the past two weeks. “The recent spate of hate, attacks that have engulfed Gauteng, are not assisting us in our efforts to increase visitation into the province and into the country. there has been a lot of enquiries coming down, whether its airlines or ground transport. A couple of airlines from British airways have been cancelled. A lot of tourism businesses have literally recorded losses over the past two weeks. So it has a direct effect on tourism.” Click on the video below:
