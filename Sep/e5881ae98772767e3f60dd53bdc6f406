The Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union (Demawusa) insists that the Metrobus strike will continue this week. The union’s Deon Makhura says the court judgment on Friday did not interdict them from continuing with their strike. This after Metrobus warned that the strike would be unprotected but Makhura says there is no such thing. “Our members will continue to embark on the strike the other serious issue, I tried to speak to Metrobus on Friday. Maybe they read that judgment differently. If they go for appeal and if they lose, the Labour Appeal Court says that demand of pay progression, we can continue to strike. They are at the losing side,” says Makhura. The union is demanding salary progression and office space. Watch a related video below:
