Branches of the African National Congress (ANC) from the five regions of Limpopo have converged on the ANC’s Luthuli House Headquarters demanding the reinstatement of the provinces’ Deputy Chairperson Florence Radzilani and treasurer Danny Msiza. The ANC’s Integrity Commission recommended the two step down from their positions nearly a year ago until their names had been cleared with regards to the pair’s alleged role in the VBS mutual bank scandal. The marchers from Limpopo have accused the ANC leadership of being selective. Regional Chairperson of Limpopo’s Peter Mokaba region, John Mpe, says a KZN Deputy chairperson is facing criminal charges, but has not been removed as chairperson. “In KZN, you have a deputy chairperson that is facing some serious criminal charges… in fact, has already been charged, he is appearing in court. His assets have been confiscated, but that comrade is still the Deputy chairperson of the province. We are also concerned, a few months ago there was a march to Capricorn municipality under the name ‘fighting corruption’ where the chairperson of the Integrity Commission was also part of the march. Now we are questioning the integrity of that chairperson.” ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule says a Committee will be established by the National Executive Committee (NEC) to resolve the leadership challenges in Limpopo. Magashule says Radzilani and Msiza did the right thing by stepping down. “The Integrity commission said the comrades must step aside and the comrades did what they said. So the comrades have now been given the opportunity, because they appealed to the highest decision-making body the National Executive Committee, and that’s why the National executive Committee has now set up a committee to deal with this matter because they have followed processes and it’s now beyond the integrity commission.”
