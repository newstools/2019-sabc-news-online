Northern Cape Premier, Dr Zamani Saul, has labelled the new Kimberley Mental Health Hospital as the statue of corruption. His utterances come after it took more than 12 years for the facility to be finally completed at a cost of about R1.3-billion. Dr Saul officially opened the new Kimberley Mental Health Hospital on the eve of mental health care month. He says the project reflects the provincial government’s weakness to implement infrastructure projects. The premier was speaking on the side-lines of the opening event. “What worries me is basically the fact that the implementation of this mental hospital, of this massive infrastructure project reflects some major weaknesses in our capacity to implement infrastructure projects, on time and on budget. So, that’s something that we need to urgently attend to taking into cognisance, the roll out of infrastructure projects that will be taking place in the province over the next five years.” For more watch video below:
