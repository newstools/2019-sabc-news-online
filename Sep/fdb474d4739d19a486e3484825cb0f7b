Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has expressed disappointment at attempts to attack other languages in South Africa. Speaking on Heritage Day,  he says the likes of Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi and ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, seek to divide the country along racial lines. Lesufi has been outspoken against the establishment of an Afrikaans university, saying that a race-based institution would fail the country. Maimane has told DA supporters in Soweto’s Vilakazi Street that an attack on the Afrikaans language could also lead to the attack on other South African languages. “I heard even from bo Panyaza who are trying to shut down the language of other people. Remember one thing; if today they start to attack a language such as Afrikaans, then tomorrow they will be attacking Tswana and then tomorrow they will be attacking Zulu and then where is our constitution, we lose the right to stand together united.”
