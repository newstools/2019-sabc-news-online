Former SABC COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that he has never lied to the public broadcaster about having a matric certificate. Motsoeneng has told the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that he joined the SABC in 1989 and went on to hold many positions. He says those who accuse him of lying about his matric, including the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, are insulting him. “It is an insult for people to say that I have lied about matric. I was approached by the head of current affair and I declared from the onset that I don’t have matric. Then he said to me that you are so talented and I don’t think you need matric to work for SABC. I have seen your contribution when you were still freelancing. Before I joined the SABC permanently, chairperson, they took me to a course to learn about broadcasting.”  Motsoeneng is responding to allegations that he interfered with the public broadcaster’s editorial mandate. He was removed from the position after it was found he lied about his qualifications. Motsoeneng says he chose work over school. “It is so painful chairperson, because media have tarnished my name about matric certificate. Worse part, it’s the Public Protector I dont know what was happening in her mind; with due respect chairperson because here is the Public Protector if you check the transcript chairperson or listen to the recording I denied lying about matric several times.”
