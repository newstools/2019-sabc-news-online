The Labour Court in Johannesburg is yet to decide on an application by Metrobus to interdict the workers’ strike.  Metrobus workers belonging to the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union (Demawusa) have been on strike since Monday. The union is demanding salary progression for experienced workers. Demawusa says it has been agreed in a meeting that the union will be given office space at Metrobus depots. Metrobus has approached the Labour Court seeking to interdict the strike pending their application for leave to appeal the court’s earlier decision to grant Demawusa the right to strike.  However, the presiding judge advised the parties that they need to approach the judge who granted Demawusa the go ahead to strike. Demawusa’s spokesperson Dion Makhura says the strike continues. Click below for more on the strike:
