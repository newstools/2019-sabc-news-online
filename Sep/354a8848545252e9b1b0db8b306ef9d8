And she fought for women. She believed in the woman’s struggle she was fighting side-by-side with all women of our country who had experience and a form of abuse she did not tolerate any such actions by males and she was very clear that women are equal to two lanes in in the Republic of South Africa.” Hlongwa will be laid to rest at the Chesterville’s Heroes Acre in Durban.
