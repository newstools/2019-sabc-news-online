Dean of Foreign Ambassadors, Ben Mpoko, says fake news fuels hostility towards foreign nationals. Mpoko was speaking after Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor announced that government would take the necessary steps to tackle the scourge of attacks on foreign nationals. Minister Pandor and Mpoko were speaking in Pretoria after meeting with ambassadors that have representation in South Africa. Mpoko says fake news can cause major social upheaval “Members of the community sometimes they react to that, and they think that’s the reality. People in continent of Africa have been sending us messages believing what they see in the video and so forth, it’s a reality, which is not.” “The challenge is how you deal with that. It becomes very difficult.”  Click video below:
