The N1 North and N1 South have been completely closed to traffic following a multi-vehicle collision that claimed at least three lives on the N1 just after the Pumulani Tollgate at Kameeldrift in Gauteng. Arrive Alive reports that two trucks and at least eight cars collided just before midday. The collision is believed to have been caused by the heavy smoke from a veld fire on the side of the road. The vehicles caught alight in the collision, but have since been doused by fire and rescue services. Motorists are advised to use alternatives routes as the closure is expected to last until approximately 6pm on Friday night.
