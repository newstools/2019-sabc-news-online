Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has lambasted the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, saying the economic recovery proposal plan will do nothing to help the poor, but only serve to further entrench white monopoly capital. He was speaking in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. “The EFF has noted the Tito Mboweni now ANC internal discussion document on the economy as a direct declaration against the working class and black people in general. After the ANC conference was openly bought by white monopoly capital we don’t take it for granted that their policy direction is going to be dictated from imperialist Euro-American academy like Harvard University.” <a href="https://iono.fm/e/741635">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Malema has called for independent trade union movements, political formations inside and outside of legislature to unite for what he calls the coming ANC war against the working class. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/741636">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
