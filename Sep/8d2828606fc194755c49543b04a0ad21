Police have confiscated large quantities of counterfeit goods following a raid at Dragon City wholesale centre in Fordsburg, Johannesburg. This is part of the policeâ€™s ongoing raids on businesses selling counterfeit goods. Last month police recovered R15-million worth of counterfeit goods during a raid on traders operating in the Joburg CBD. Hundreds of people including illegal traders and undocumented migrants were arrested. Gauteng police together with the South African Revenue Services and Home Affairs officials are moving from store to store breaking-open packaged goods searching for any counterfeit products. Some of the mostly Chinese owned businesses closed shop immediately when word got out that police were raiding the stores for counterfeit goods. Some of the business people could be seen running away and jumping over fences. Police have confiscated large quantities of counterfeit products including home appliances, watches, big brand clothes and sneakers.
