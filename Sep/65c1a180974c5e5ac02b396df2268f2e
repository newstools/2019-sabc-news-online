Tshwane Member of Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Community Safety and Emergency Services Karen Meyer has accused some SAPS officers of dealing in drugs. Speaking on Morning Live, Meyer says she has received reports and footage showing police dealing in drugs. This information comes on the back of collaborative efforts between the taxi industry, law enforcement officials and the City of Tshwane to restore order across the City. In August, violence erupted in the Tshwane CBD after a taxi driver, identified as Jabu Baloyi, was shot allegedly by a foreign national.   The drivers had confronted alleged drug dealers in the CBD. In retaliation, some angry Tshwane residents set alight and looted numerous stores suspected of being run by foreign nationals on Wednesday, accusing them of selling drugs to young people. The Lilian Ngoyi and Brown Street intersection is popularly known as a hotspot for drug dealing.Â Often, nyaope addicts gather at this intersection to buy and smoke drugs. Watch related video:
