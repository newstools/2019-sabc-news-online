ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, says he is not concerned at all after being implicated by several people at the State Capture Commission. In his testimony last week, former Free State Economic Development MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana implicated Magashule in corruption during his time as premier.  Magashule and other NEC members have been in the North West to introduce the party’s newly established Interim Provincial Committee.  Magashule rejects the allegations against him, but he remains elusive on whether he will consider defending himself at the Commission. “Let’s give that commission a platform. Many people want to go to that commission so leave it there. I am not worried at all. The truth shall prevail. It’s a commission not a court of law. So lawyers and legal people are the advisors.”
