The case against former apartheid police officer Joao Rodrigues has been postponed to the 12th of December for a trial date. Rodrigues appeared in the High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. He is accused of the murder of anti-Apartheid activist Ahmed Timol in 1971. An inquest found Timol was thrown to his death from the 10th floor of the Johannesburg Central Police Station. Rodrigues seemed relaxed and listened attentively as the judge addressed him. His application for a permanent stay of prosecution was unsuccessful. It was rejected by the full bench of the High Court in Johannesburg last week. His bail has been extended.
