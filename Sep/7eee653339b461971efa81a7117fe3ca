Former Hawks investigator, Colonel Kobus Roelofse, has described how top senior police officials obstructed his investigation into the looting of a crime intelligence secret service fund and investigations into then Crime Intelligence boss, Richard Mdluli. Heâ€™s also detailed how then Hawks Head Berning Ntlemeza, stopped him from investigating Mdluli. Roelofse concluded his testimony at the State Capture Commission on Friday. He said several senior police officials either failed to act or deliberately frustrated investigations by not declassify documents related to the probe. Among those listed, are former police commissioners Riah Phiyega and Kgomotso Phahlane. Roelofse also fingered the current commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, as having failed to act. He says attempts by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate to obtain the documents were also unsuccessful. Eight years later, Roelofse says, the documents have still not been declassified, much to the dismay of the inquiry chair, who said the commission would be applying its mind to the matter.
