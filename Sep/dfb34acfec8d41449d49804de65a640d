Residents of Mathanga in Nxarhuni, near East London, say they’ve been without water for the last two months, and this has put a strain on their lives. This as the province’s water crisis deepens with dam levels dropping drastically in some areas. A resident Nomvula Jikija says the water trucks that the Buffalo City Metro has been sending are unreliable. “Sometimes we have water and sometimes we don’t, and now we don’t have water at all. We only received water from the water trucks but they are unreliable. We last had water last week Saturday.” Buffalo City Metro spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya says measures have been put in place to ensure that communities that are without water are met half-way. “We’ve gone through the assessment and we’ve realised that they need a very important intervention and as such one of the main areas is the fact that our pipes there are old as well as they are also broken. Secondly there is no channel between Nahoon River as well as surrounding villages like Newlands and Nqonqweni. So what we’ve done as the municipality we’ve appointed a service provider which is expected to be on site in the next month, so that we can actually have one decisive intervention to the area.”
