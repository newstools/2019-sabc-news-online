The High Education, Science and Technology Minister Blade Nzimande has called on technological front runners not to leave behind students from rural universities in South Africa. Nzimande was addressing the Southern Africa Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference in Ballito north of Durban. The meeting looks at how technological advancements can improve people’s lives in various sectors from education to health. He says universities in rural areas must also benefit from the opportunities in the fourth industrial revolution. “Don’t continue to leave behind your former black universities in South Africa. Which are mainly rural and still carry the scars of having being built to serve a population that is oppressed.” “It’s fine that SATNAC must partner with our more developed universities, but at the same time you can’t leave the University of Zululand, Fort Hare University. Innovation is everywhere in our country including youngsters who come from rural areas.”
