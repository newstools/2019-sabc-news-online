Thursday marks 42 years since Black Consciousness leader, Steve Bantu Biko, died in detention. According to SA History Online, Biko was a popular voice of Black liberation in South Africa between the mid-1960s and his death in police detention in 1977. According to his biography, Biko was arrested four times in the late 1970s and detained for several months at a time. He was arrested in Port Elizabeth in August 1977. A month later on September 11, Biko was found naked and shackled several kilometres away in Pretoria. He died from a brain haemorrhage the following day on September 12, 1977. It was later discovered that the haemorrhage resulted from the injuries he had sustained while in police custody. Bikoâ€™s death caused national outrage.
