An Uber driver has allegedly been hijacked and his cash and his cell phone taken in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. It is alleged that the driver received a request to pick up a person in the Young Park suburb, where he found three men who got into the vehicle and requested that he go to Greenacres Shopping Centre. As he was about to drive off, it is alleged that the two men at the back seat of the Uber car held him at gun point and ordered him to get out. Police spokesperson Priscilla Naidu said the suspects allegedly drove off in the Uber driverâ€™s white Datsun Go. Investigations are under way
