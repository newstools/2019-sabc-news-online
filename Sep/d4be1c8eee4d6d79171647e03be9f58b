The Hawks in the North West have confirmed that they are investigating a case of extortion against former Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipal Mayor Themba Gwabeni, and Public Works and Roads MEC Saliva Molapisi. This is after former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo laid criminal charges against the two. Mahumapelo alleges that Gwabeni and Molapisi approached him with the intent to extort money from him when he was still a premier. “I have taken a decision to open a criminal case with the Hawks against Mr Gwabeni and Mr Molapisi. Around 2016, these two gentlemen accompanied by others, whose details will be made while we are in court, approached me with an attempt to lure me into a corrupt arrangement, which related to the management of the buses of a company called NTI here in the North West.”
