Political analyst Khaya Sithole says the current controversy surrounding Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane may be a result of the factionalism within the party. Maimane has denied holding onto a car provided by now disgraced Steinhoff executive Markus Jooste – despite concerns it could hurt the image of the party. The DA has reiterated that it is fully behind Maimane. Maimane says he returned the vehicle soon after allegations of misconduct at Steinhoff emerged. Sithole says the DA has displayed evidence of internal factionalism with its approach to the matter: “Accountability is when you come out to the public long before somebody leaks the story and long before someone finds a way to make the story available to the public and say look, we’ve done something like this and we feel that it’s important for us to come to the public and disclose the nature of the circumstances so that we can be aware of what it is that went on. Now what seems to have happened here is that because there are some particular factions within the DA that are possibly trying to unseat Mmusi Maimane, at least according to his version, they are now leaking the story and then the DA is saying oh we did the right thing, we returned the car when it was appropriate to do so.” WATCH BELOW:
