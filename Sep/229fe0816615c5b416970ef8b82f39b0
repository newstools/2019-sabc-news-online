The Automobile Association (AA) says fuel prices are likely to rise in October following the attack on an oil refinery in Saudi Arabia. The AA predicts that 95-Octane petrol will increase by around 19 cents a litre, diesel by 25 cents a litre and paraffin by 24 cents a litre. However the AA says the price of 93-octane looks set to decrease by four-cents per litre. The Association says the Rand performed fairly strongly against the US dollar during most of September helping to offset some of the impact of increased oil prices. “Without the Rand’s performance, we could have been looking at price rises in excess of 40 cents a litre for some fuels,” comments the AA.
