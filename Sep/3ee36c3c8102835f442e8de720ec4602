Hundreds of staff from Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong formed a human chain to join a city-wide strike in support of anti-government protesters on Monday. Local Hong Kong media showed footage of hundreds of hospital staff holding hands and standing along hospital hallways, many of them carrying placards and banners. “I’m quite disappointed in society, that there are people that can say such unreasonable things. We have no choice but to come out (and protest),” one unnamed protester said. The strike follows a weekend marred by some of the worst violence since unrest escalated more than three months ago, with protesters burning barricades and throwing petrol bombs, and police retaliating with water cannons, tear gas and batons.
