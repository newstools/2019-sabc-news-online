The Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has blamed what he terms government’s policy incoherence for the country’s unemployment crisis. South Africa’s current unemployment rate stands at 29%, with the young being the most affected. Maimane says the DA will on Thursday table an economic recovery plan in Parliament which will compel government to find urgent solutions that move beyond party lines. “Starting with the constitutional obligations which say we need to be able to guarantee citizens’ rights now. A hungry citizen is not going to have their rights guaranteed. Clearly, poor people in this country are on the rise.” “It’s clear to me that South Africa needs to make decisions about SOEs, decisions about how to help small businesses.” “How do we ensure that cities take a forefront, how do we ensure that our citizens are safe and so we’ll be tabling a plan to say here are the immediate steps that we need to take ensure that our economy begins to create work, begins to grow.” Click video below:
