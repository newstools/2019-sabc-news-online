The Eastern Cape government says it is focusing on the social environment that leads to gender-based violence as the country mourns a boxing star that was shot dead allegedly by her ex-boyfriend. Premier Lubabalo Mabuyane and Sports MEC Fezeka Bayeni are expected to visit the mother of slain boxing star Leighandre “Baby Lee” Jegels in an East London hospital. She was wounded in the shooting. Mabuyane’s spokesperson, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha says the premier is concerned about gender-based violence in the province. “The premier welcomes the swift action to arrest the killer. The premier is calling on the people of the province to soundly and physically fight gender-based violence by reporting any incidents similar to it or that triggers such violence to the police early so that we can end against women and children.” The provincial government has held round table discussions in King William’s Town. The province is one of the worst affected by gender violence. In March 2019, Busisiwe Ngwadla was brutally stabbed to death by her boyfriend in East-London. Busisiwe’s mother, Nobubele Mbolekwa says: “Those people who murdered their wives and girlfriends and children must rot in jail, all of them, because the family of the members have no peace after the incidents.” Related video click below:
