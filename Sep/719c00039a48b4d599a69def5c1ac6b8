Business leaders in Durban have told the city’s new mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, what they feel are the most pressing challenges that ought to be addressed. They were attending a CEO Forum meeting with Kaunda, who was recently redeployed by the African National Congress (ANC) to lead the metro amid service delivery challenges. Kaunda has vowed to engage with the business community to explore ways in which business and the city can develop the economy together. The newly elected eThekwini Metro mayor Kaunda says bringing back stability within the municipality is top of his agenda. Kaunda admitted there a lot to do to improve poor service delivery. There’s a new drive to change the image of the municipality.  But it will be an uphill battle after the tense political climate during the process of replacing former Mayor Zandile Gumede and her executive. But now stakeholders have pledged support for the new mayor and also called for change. The eThekwini Mayor says while he’s up for the task,”it won’t be possible without a collaborated effort.” “The issues of ensuring that we bring about stability, we have plans to engage stakeholders especially building strong safety committee to work with a provincial government to bring about safety of our citizens.” Although the mayor admits he needs help to turn things around – he emphasized those on board better deliver or face consequences.
