Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams is hopeful the much-needed funding relief for the SABC will finally come through this week. National Treasury agreed to provide the SABC with interim financial relief in March to prevent the broadcaster from collapsing. The SABC has been struggling to pay its creditors. It was declared technically insolvent at the end of January 2019. Ndabeni-Abrahams says: “I have received a report of the senate. SABC has managed to do all the things that we spoke about which therefore qualifies them for a certain amount that they are gonna be getting.” She says she will not disclose the exact amount as officials from her department and Treasury are working together to agree on the final amount to be transferred. “Hopefully it will be by this week,” adds Ndabeni-Abrahams Watch video below:
