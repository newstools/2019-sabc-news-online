The body of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been taken back to his home village of Kutama Zvimba. This according to a reliable family source who spoke to SABC News. There is a strong indication that Mugabe will be buried in Kutama. Following Mugabe’s death on September 6th in Singapore, there was disagreement between his family and the administration of current President Emmerson Mnangagwa on where the former leader would be buried. It was then agreed that he would be laid to rest in the Heroes Acre in the capital Harare. However, due to construction, the burial was delayed for 30 days and Mugabe’s body has been kept at his Blue Roof home. Mnangagwa is currently not in the country as he is attending the UN General Assembly in New York. Watch the video below for more on the story:
