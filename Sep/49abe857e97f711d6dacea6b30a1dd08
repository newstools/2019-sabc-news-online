Community leaders in Nyanga, Cape Town, say they will hold a crime summit in November in an attempt to resolve the crime situation. With 289 murders in the last financial year, Nyanga has once more recorded the highest murders in the country. The community handed over a memorandum of grievances to the local police station decrying the very high crime rate. Community leader, Tulani Pike, says they are seeking long term solutions. “We want the national department to assist our police because stats which are a tool of analysis, stats have been showing that there is a problem in Nyanga, hence we are saying Nyanga must be a focus area. We want that change.” Watch related video below:
