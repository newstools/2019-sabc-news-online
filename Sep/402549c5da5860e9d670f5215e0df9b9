Former Head of Free State Agriculture Department, Peter Thabethe is back at the the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Monday. Thabethe will continue his testimony about his role in the controversial Vrede dairy farm project in the Free State. Part of the agreement was that Estina, a Gupta-linked company, would provide the “capital injection” of R200 million. However public funds were instead allegedly channelled into a project which was the provincial government’s initiative to promote and benefit black emerging farmers. During his appearance before the commission last month, Thabethe conceded that the department had not done proper due diligence on Estina. It was further revealed that the Gupta linked company only had R16 in its bank account – this a day before the agreement with the Department was signed.
