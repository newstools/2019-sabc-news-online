President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned the resurgence of violence that claimed two lives in Johannesburg on Sunday. The President has called on law enforcement agencies to maintain vigilance and firmness in dealing with individuals or groups who take the law into their own hands. He has applauded the police for arresting at least 17 people after a group went on the rampage following an event at which former Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, addressed hostel residents on Gauteng’s East Rand.  The strongly worded statement issued by the Presidency says those who upset the country’s public order must expect to face the gravest impact of the law. It states that government will not allow sporadic lawlessness and violence to disrupt the safety and livelihoods of millions of South Africans and foreign nationals. The statement further points out that lawlessness, injury and death inflict a great psychological and economic cost and against South Africa’s prosperity and stability as a nation.
