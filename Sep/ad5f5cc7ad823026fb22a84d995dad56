ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says the high unemployment rate in South Africa is worrying and drastic changes need to be urgently implemented soon to tackle the problem. He says the ANC National Executive Committee will meet with the SACP, Cosatu and Sanco this weekend to draft a strategy that will assist to grow the economy. Ramaphosa was addressing thousands of members of teachers’ union, Sadtu at Nasrec south of Johannesburg. He said initiatives in which trade unions are consulted would see the country change for the better. “This unemployment rate is just not acceptable. It has to be brought down and it now requires all of us to apply our minds on how we are going to unlock the real energy of our economy, so that we have an inclusive economy that is going to answer the issue of reducing poverty among all our people.” WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW FOR MORE ON THE STORY:
