The South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) says its planned banking strike on Friday, September 27, will see a total shutdown of all banking services, including ATMs. Sasbo Secretary-General Joe Kokela says members of the public may not be able to access funds on the day. All 73 000 Sasbo members could down tools in protest against planned retrenchments. Koleka says the financial institutions displayed an arrogant attitude during negotiations. He says all of the countryâ€™s four major banks will be affected by the strike. Watch a related video below:
