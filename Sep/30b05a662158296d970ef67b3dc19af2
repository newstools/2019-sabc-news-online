Former President Jacob Zuma’s wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma also known as “MaNtuli” is considering a civil litigation case after the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) declined to prosecute her for the alleged poisoning of her estranged husband. Acting KwaZulu-Natal director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate Elaine Zungu has reportedly written a letter to the Hawks in which she says there’s no evidence to pursue the case. Zuma had reportedly also not provided a statement detailing the alleged poisoning attempt on his life. Zungu said because of this, she could not even refer to Zuma as a complainant. In 2015, the then State Security minister David Mahlobo banned MaNtuli from his Nkandla residence following “revelations” of her suspected involvement in a plot to poison Zuma. MaNtuli’s lawyer, Ulrich Roux says this was abuse of power. “She obviously suffered severe reputational and emotional damage. To have an attempted murder charge hanging over your head for five years and then to find out that there was in fact never any evidence suggesting so; obviously someone needs to answer to that. She is at the moment considering her position regarding that and whether we will be instituting civil action for damages against the NPA as well as the SAPS, but also against the people in charge of this institutions in their personal capacity.”
