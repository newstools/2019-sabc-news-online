The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) led by Mzwanele Nyontsho has vowed to set up a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge to investigate factionalism within party ranks. This is one of the resolutions taken at the end of the party’s National Executive Committee held in Vereeniging, south of Johannesburg on Sunday. The PAC has been rocked by infighting with another faction led by Narius Moloto also claiming to be the legitimate leadership structure of the party. The newly-elected Party Secretary General Apa Pooe says they want to deal with factionalism in the party once and for all. “With regard to factionalism, this continues to bedevil our organisation as we have taken a decision that we are going to have an inquiry within the organisation that will be possibly led by a retired judge or a lawyer who is associated with the PAC; who understands the PAC dynamics; who will be going throughout the breath and length of our country engaging with our structures, trying to find a source of factionalism. Because we do not understand what are the other external factors that are at play here. So, we are doing that as an organisation so that we get to the root cause of these problems.”
