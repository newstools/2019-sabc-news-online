Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has welcomed the Labour Court’s decision to interdict the banking strike. The Labour court on Thursday ruled the intended protest action by union the South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) and Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) is unlawful and cannot go ahead. The strike was planned for Friday. Judge Hillary Rapkin-Naicker says the two unions failed to comply with the provisions of section 77 of the Labour Relations Act. Earlier this week, Busa filed an urgent application at the Labour court to stop the protest action from going ahead. Busa argued that the period between the notice to the National Economic Development Labour Council and the protest action did not satisfy the requirements of a protected action. Nedlac’s convenor for Busa, Kaizer Moyane, spoke to SABC News. Watch video below:
