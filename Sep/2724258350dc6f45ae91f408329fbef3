Mzwanele Nyhontso has been re-elected as the president of one of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) factions, with Lunga Mantashe as his deputy. They were elected during the party’s elective congress held in Bloemfontein. Apa Pooe has retained his position as the secretary general of the party. The new NEC has also been elected.  Another faction held its national conference in Polokwane last weekend, where Narius Moloto was elected as President. The party’s veterans say they are tired of factions and leadership squabbles within the party. The party has been marred by infighting and court battles. The new leadership says the public must know that there is only one PAC. Nyhontso says he is against reports that there are factions within the party. He says they will take action against those who divide the party. “So the SABC must stop calling us factions. Stop dividing PAC; stop confusing the people tell the people the truth. This is the only PAC we won the court case; we were given a go ahead to hold this congress and anyone who is calling himself PAC has defied himself outside of the PAC and that person is an enemy of the PAC. PAC is one.” Watch related videos below:
