Former SABC Board chair, Dr Ben Ngubane, is on Monday expected to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. He was the chair of the public broadcaster’s board from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, the former public protector Thuli Madonsela made damning findings in her report titled, “When Governance and Ethics fail”. Leonard Lekgetho and Anton van Vuuren will also testify. In her report, Madonsela found that, during Dr Ngubane’s tenure as the board chair, the board was dysfunctional and that Ngubane performed functions of an executive by authorising numerous salary increments for former SABC COO Motsoeneng. The report also found that Mr Motsoeneng was allowed to operate above the law, undermining the GCEO and caused staff to perform unlawful duties. Click related video below:
