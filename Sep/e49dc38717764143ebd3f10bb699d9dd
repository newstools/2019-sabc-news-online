President Cyril Ramaphosa says the Constitutional Court ruling – that confirms that corporal punishment at home is unconstitutional – will further assist in combating the abuse of children. Ramaphosa had called a joint sitting of Parliament to discuss violence against women and children.   The President says the many forms of child abuse must be fought on all levels. “ConCourt handed down extremely important judgment. When talk about violence against children, focus on sexual abuse but battering of children is a very serious problem that must also get attention. Children must be protected from all forms of violence, in home, streets or schools,” explains the President.
