Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says it is up to the people of Marikana in the North West to decide whether or not they want President Cyril Ramaphosa to visit them. He was reacting to the recent call by Cosatu that Ramaphosa visits Marikana. Malema was among the first people to arrive in Marikana after the tragedy in 2012 that saw 34 miners killed in a hail of police assault rifle fire. When he delivered the eulogy of the late ANC stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, President Ramaphosa promised to fulfil Madikizela-Mandela’s wish for him to meet with Marikana widows. However, Malema says ordinary residents of Marikana must be consulted. “The people of Marikana will decide what they want but they know Cyril for who he is. It’s a man that issued emails and declared fellow workers as criminals. If they want to welcome him, it is their own call, it is a democratic country.” Related video click below, Joseph Mathunjwa addressing the 7th Marikana massacre commemoration
