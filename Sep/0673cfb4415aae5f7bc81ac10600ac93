A church service is taking place at the Mugabe home in Borrowdale ahead of the transportation of the former President Robert Mugabe‘s body to the Rufaro National Stadium, where his body will lie in state for two days. The body arrived at the Robert Mugabe International Airport on Wednesday. Mugabe, aged 95, died last week Friday in Singapore. Scores of ZANU-PF branch members have arrived at the veteran statesman’s home and will accompany the body across the capital Harare on the first day of public viewing. The body is expected to arrive at the stadium at nine am with early morning traffic in the capital expected to experience major disruptions as the procession travels across town.
