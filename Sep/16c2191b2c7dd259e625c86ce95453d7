The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that a mediation agreement led to the withdrawal of sexual assault and crimen injuria charges against former African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape Chairperson Marius Fransman. Fransman’s former personal assistant Louisa Wynand had accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were on their way to the ANC’s January eighth celebrations at Rustenburg in the North West in 2016. Wynand has declined to comment further. “The parties concerned reached a mediation agreement where all the parties were happy with the terms of that agreement and the prosecutor satisfied herself that the complainant is in full agreement to withdraw the matter,” says Northern Cape NPA spokesperson, Phaladi Shuping.
