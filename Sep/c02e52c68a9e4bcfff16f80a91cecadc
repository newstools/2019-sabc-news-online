The African Farmers Association of South Africa in Limpopo says the drought conditions have negative impact on their business. The farmers have problems accessing water due to drying dams and rivers as well as water restrictions. The UN Climate Action summit gets underway in New York on Monday. Organisation chairperson Tshianeo Mathidi wants the summit to discuss ways of dealing with climate change. Mathidi says they need assistance to continue with the farming business. “Farmers themselves, what they need is a technical information, technical support and also the finance, so that they will be able to survive under this industry… normally you will find that in this international conference they discuss more about the policy, not the final details that can upgrade farmers.” Department of Water and Sanitation spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says most provinces are slowly recovering from 2014 and 2018 drought situations except the Eastern Cape. “The most concern for us at the moment is the Eastern Cape it hasn’t quite recovered as much as the other provinces in terms of recharging of rivers, especially speed into our dams, when you look at other provinces there are recoveries but there are still maybe pocket like you would have in Limpopo the province has recovered but you still have pockets around Sekhukhune Vhembe and around Giyani where you may find Middle Letaba been a bit dry.” Click on the related videos below:
