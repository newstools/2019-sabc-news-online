The Ekurhuleni Metro Municipality says blood samples were not taken to establish whether the suspended Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department officer was drunk or not. The municipality has now suspended a metro police superintendent and another female officer for allegedly defeating the ends of justice and dereliction of duty. A video of the officer allegedly drunk and consuming more alcohol inside the police vehicle has gone viral on social media. The female officer is accused of assisting the allegedly drunk officer to escape from the scene. The acting municipal spokesperson Solly Mashabela says: “The officer was suspected of being drunk and blood tests should have been taken and they were not taken. We suspect it is the assistance of the two officers so they are investigated to find out whether they assisted the officer to avoid having blood samples taken from him.”
