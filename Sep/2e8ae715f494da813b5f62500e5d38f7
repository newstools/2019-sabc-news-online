A man has allegedly stabbed his partner’s 3-year-old boy to death and critically injured another 7-year-old boy in Mahikeng in North West. Police have launched a manhunt for the 32-year-old man. The incident took place earlier on Wednesday at Bokone Village in Mahikeng. Police spokesperson, Yvonne Tshabile has appealed to community members to assist in tracking down the alleged suspect. “The suspect, who is 32 years old … he stabbed and killed the 3-year-old boy and injured a 7-year-old boy. Unfortunately, the 3-year-old died at the scene of the incident, while the 7-year-old is currently in hospital receiving medical care. It’s further alleged that the suspect fled the scene.” Meanwhile, two men have been handed double life sentences each by the Bhisho High Court in the Eastern Cape. Luthando Kondile and Hlumani Baleka shot and killed 61-year-old Nonkululeko Swartbooi in front of her autistic son. They further killed her 23-year-old son, Libona, in April 2015. “They kidnapped the son of the deceased who was their friend and took the keys from him, broke into his home, tied the mother with the rope, shot and killed her, stole her firearm and her vehicle and then they also killed their friend, who was the son of this mother. I think this sentence goes a long way into making sure that it sends a strong message to the youth out there, that crime will never be tolerated by our court. Even if they are young, they must think twice before committing crime, because these youths are in the prime of their lives, but now they have to go and spend time in jail.”
