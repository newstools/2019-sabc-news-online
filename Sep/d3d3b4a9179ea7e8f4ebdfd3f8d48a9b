National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Chairperson, Amos Masondo, say they are shocked and saddened by the passing of MP and Deputy Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Bavelile Hlongwa. They say Hlongwa is one of the new MPs and member of the National Executive who brought great energy and remarkable enthusiasm to the new administration’s plan to radically change the quality of lives of South Africans. Hlongwa died in a car accident on the N1 highway near Carousel outside Pretoria. “As a qualified and experienced leader who rose through the political, public and corporate ranks, she fitted like a glove in the portfolio in the Mineral Resources and Energy Department. And she infused necessary youthful energy in driving this important sector of our economy. The presiding officers have said that the passing of such a young talented and vibrant leader with incredible sharp mind and clarity of thought, who was genuinely dedicated to the cause of social and economic transformation of the people, is a devastating loss not only to Parliament and government, but the entire nation. The Presiding officers on behalf of the leadership of Parliament, extend their heartfelt sympathies to Deputy Minister Hlongwa’s family, friends and her comrades in the African National Congress,” says Parliament’s spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo. The African National Congress (ANC) through its General Secretary, Ace Magashule, has added its voice to many tributes following the passing of Hlongwa. “In her we saw a real potential, real capacity a person passionate about matters affecting young people, affecting women, affecting children. Well grounded, qualified she was an engineer and I think we’re actually passing condolences to her family, to the ANC membership, to her friends, to the society, to the people of the continent; and we bow our heads and say we’ll pick up the spear and aluta continua.”
