The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro says all is set for the by-elections special votes which will commence on Tuesday. The IEC has received over 600 requests for special votes, with more than 200 of them being home visits, while more than 450 people will visit the voting stations. Wards in four municipalities which include Buffalo City Metro, King Sabatha Dalindyebo and Engcobo Municipality will be contested in these by-elections. The electoral commission is calling on residents to ensure that they are registered to vote. Nelson Mandela Bay IEC Regional Supervisor, Crosby Bacela, says they are expecting a lot of people for these by-elections. “I think we can expect an active by-election just because this is a decider in the wards. You’ll know that the council requires that vacancy to be filled so that decisions can be taken hence I am saying it’s going to be a very busy by election,” says Bacela.
