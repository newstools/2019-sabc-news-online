About 40 000 aviation enthusiasts have converged on the Zwartkop Air force Base in Pretoria for the annual museum air show.  The 2019 edition of the show began on Friday under the theme, “Collective Heritage.” The aim of the show is to show gratitude to members of South African Air Force. An exhilarating event attracted the young and old from all walks of life. Thousands of people were treated to some precision demonstrations which included flights doing double-knife edge passes.  However, the Cheetah fighter jet stole the moment with a stunningly professional display. The event also showcased a variety of businesses, providing an opportunity to celebrate military aviation in both static and flying conditions. South African Air Force Lieutenant General Zimpande Msimang says this year’s event is a build-up to the Africa Aerospace and Defence 2020 Expo which is the largest contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product.
