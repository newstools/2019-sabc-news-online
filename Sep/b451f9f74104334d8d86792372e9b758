The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the fact that the South African National Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL) has only managed to collect R678.7 million for the 2018/2019 financial year again shows that the e-toll system must be scrapped. SANRAL’s integrated annual report shows that the agency collected R1.87 billion in the previous financial year. The DA’s Gauteng Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport Fred Nel says his party will continue to pressure premier David Makhura to lodge an inter-governmental dispute on e-tolls. Many Gauteng motorists have been refusing to pay for the e-tolls since the system was introduced in 2013. In August, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula was supposed to make an announcement on the e-tolls, but instead he asked for extra time to consult stakeholders on the matter.
