The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef)  says it welcomes the decision by Tiso Blackstar to grant its associate editor Ranjeni Munusamy special leave in light of allegations against her at the State Capture Commission. Tiso Blackstar says Munusamy is innocent until proven guilty – but has placed her on special leave because of the seriousness of the allegations. Hawks officer Kobus Roelefse told the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that more than R140 000 from the Crime Intelligence slush fund, was allegedly paid in 2008 into a WesBank car finance account to settle Munusamy’s debt. Sanef says in a statement that they will closely monitor Munusamy’s co-operation with the State Capture Commission, and will await the outcome of Tiso’s internal investigation.
