The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Johannesburg has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of sabotaging service delivery in the municipality. This is after the ANC disrupted council meetings twice this week. The DA accused the ANC of bringing proceedings to a halt on Friday after pushing for another motion of no confidence in Mayor Herman Mashaba. The DA’s Tsepo Mhlongo says all the ANC wants is to contravene the law. “What is happening is not allowed. The rule states clearly. They withdrew the motion of no confidence. They, themselves, withdrew it. It takes plus minus three months for it to come back. That is the rule. Now, we respect the rule of law. Council procedures state clearly that it cannot be put on the agenda the following month. You cannot do that.”
