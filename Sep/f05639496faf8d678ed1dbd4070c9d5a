Learning and teaching has been disrupted at the Dumani Junior Primary School in KwaMashu north of Durban. Learners had to be sent home after the body of a woman was found by learners at the school’s female toilets earlier on Monday. The learners informed the school caretaker Bongani Memela. The school is situated near a popular drinking spot. Parents fear its proximity to the school might have contributed to the death of the woman. Memela says although the school had a series of break-ins before, this is the first time someone was killed within the school premises. “Today, we were shocked here at school. When I arrived to open, I noticed that the learners were pointing, indicating that something had happened… and when I went to look, I found a woman laying on the floor. When I examined her I found that she was dead. We are still shocked as it is it’s painful. We are not okay; even the kids were sent back home because they were going to be traumatised. It’s the first time that a person has died inside school premises, but we usually have break-ins.” Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education Spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa says the incident is worrying. “The Department notes with grave concern the incident that happened at Dumani Primary School in KwaMashu. It’s sad, you know, that something like this had to happen in one of our schools, but at the moment, we do not wish to speculate in terms of what led to this situation. We are going to wait for the report a formal report will be submitted to us by our officials at a circuit and district level and we take it from there.”
