Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Dr Blade Nzimande says diplomatic relations between South Africa and China are beneficial to both nations, not just China. Nzimande says the relations are grounded in the respect both countries have for one another. He says they will also play an integral role in improving the country’s weakened state-owned enterprises. Nzimande was speaking during the celebration of the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, at the Chinese embassy in Pretoria. “So, our interaction with China is based on total respect of the sovereignty of each country, as well as the sovereignty in the decisions that we are making. So, the cooperation is mutually beneficial. We cannot enter into relations that take South African back to some kind of colonial dependence and so on.”
