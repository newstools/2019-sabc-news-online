More than 700 Rand West City Local Municipality employees could soon be unemployed on Gauteng’s West Rand. The municipality will from Monday start issuing letters of dismissal. The municipality says the workers have been engaged in an unprotected strike for close to a month, leaving the municipality in serious financial ruin. Service delivery has also grounded to a halt. Workers belonging to the South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) and Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (Imatu) have been on strike demanding salary increases. “In the interest of service delivery and stability in the municipality, we announce the following: All Samwu and Imatu striking workers are dismissed with immediate effect. Management will be issuing individual letters from the 30th of September 2019,” says Themba Goba, Municipal Manager.
