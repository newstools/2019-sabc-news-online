Pretoria is deploying Special Envoys throughout Africa to demonstrate solidarity with the continent. The move comes in the wake of a spate of attacks on foreign nationals in the past few weeks. The team will travel to countries like Nigeria, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo  (DRC) and Zambia among others. President Cyril  Ramaphosa says the envoys will reinforce the message that Pretoria remains committed to Pan Africanism. “I think it’s important that we should recognise that we are connected to the whole globe, to other countries. We have responsibility which is recognised by the United Nations (UN), by the migration protocol. We have that people when they move to our country we have to treat them like human beings as we want to be treated like human beings.” For more watch video below:
