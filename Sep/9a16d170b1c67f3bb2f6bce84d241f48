KwaZulu-Natal police are preparing to combat alleged planned xenophobic attacks in Ndwedwe and Verulam, north of Durban. A message circulating on social media is calling on community members to engage in among other things assault against foreign nationals and looting. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says all those who participate in illegal activities will be arrested. “Now that we have heard of the attempts of xenophobic attacks and observed actual attacks on foreign nationals in other areas, we as KZN police have been proactive by being vigilant and making sure that foreign nationals are checked on at all times. There have not been cases reported by targetted groups,” says Mbhele. Watch related video below:
