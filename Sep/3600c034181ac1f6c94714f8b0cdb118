The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein has dismissed with costs the appeal of Cash Paymaster Services (CPS). The court has ordered CPS to pay the legal costs of civil society organisation – Corruption Watch, including those of two counsels. CPS had approached the SCA to challenge the ruling of the High Court in Pretoria which had ordered it to pay back R316 million to the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). CPS had submitted that it would be unfair to pay back the disputed R316 million to SASSA as per the High Court order. They’ve argued that the initial contract with SASSA did not include the registration of the children. However, SASSA submitted that CPS should have sought clarification regarding any inconsistencies with the contract. The High Court had ordered CPS to repay the money after Corruption Watch took both CPS and SASSA to court to challenge the decision. This is how Justice Mandisa Maya handed down judgment. “The appeal is dismissed. The appellant is directed to pay the third respondent’s costs including the costs of the two counsels. I hand down the judgement.” Click video below for more:
