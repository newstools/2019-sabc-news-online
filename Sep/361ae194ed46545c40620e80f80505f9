The family of the slain boxing star, Leighandre “Baby-Lee” Jegels, and the boxing fraternity say she has been failed by the justice system. Her memorial service was held at East London City hall on Wednesday. The 25-year-old former South African boxing and karate champion died after she was shot multiple times allegedly by her ex-boyfriend at Mdantsane near East London two weeks ago. The boyfriend, Bulelani Mnyaka, was a police officer who allegedly used a service pistol to kill Jegels.  Mnyaka died in hospital later from injuries sustained in a car crash while fleeing from the police.  Family spokesperson and manager of Jegels Mlandeli Tengimfene says they are devastated by her death. “The system has failed us and the family also feels so, even the mother has told the president during his visit at the hospital that she was failed by justice. Because in the interdict one of the reasons we stated was that – take off the firearm of this boy and it was not taken so we say were not protected.” As the country lays to rest Jegels this weekend, Boxing South Africa (BSA) CEO Tsholofelo Lejaka says Jegels’ painful death will be etched in their minds for a long time. Lejaka says BSA will devise a plan to honour the young prospect to forever remain an inspiration to upcoming boxers. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/743968">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Last week, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) announced that they will investigate the alleged involvement of a police officer in the death of Jegels.
