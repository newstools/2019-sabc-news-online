The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein is on Monday expected to deliver judgment on a matter involving Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) and South African Social Security Agency. CPS approached the SCA in an effort to challenge the ruling by the high court in Pretoria, which ordered them to pay back the more than R316 million to SASSA that was irregularly paid in 2014. The high court had ordered CPS to repay the money after Corruption Watch took both CPS and SASSA to court. CPS has now petitioned the SCA after they were refused leave to appeal the High Court ruling. CPS had submitted that it would be unfair to pay back the disputed R316 million to SASSA as per the High Court order. They’ve argued that the initial contract with SASSA did not include the registration of the children. However, SASSA submitted that CPS should have sought clarification regarding any inconsistencies with the contract. While on the other hand, Corruption Watch challenged the legality of the questionable payment to CPS. They’ve argued that the re-registration of beneficiaries of social grants was already catered for in the original contract between CPS and SASSA.
