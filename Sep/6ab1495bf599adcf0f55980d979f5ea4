Johannesburg’s Metrobus management has decided to stop all bus services as the strike enters the second day. Metrobus says this is due to acts of intimidation. On Monday a Metrobus was reportedly hijacked but later found parked at the Ghandi Square bus terminal in central Johannesburg. The strike is led by municipal workers union Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union(DEMAWU) . However, other unions SAMWU and IMATU are not on strike. DEMAWU is demanding salary progression for experienced employees and office space to be allocated to the union in all three Metrobus depots. Metrobus spokesperson, Goodwill Shivuri says they could not guarantee the safety of commuters and the staff. He says: “The strike is in full swing, we are not operating any of our busses today and that is a result of intimidation that we experienced on Monday. The service has been halted indefinitely.” He says negotiations are starting again this morning. “We are hoping that we should be able to resolve the issue because there are only two demands that we are focusing on,” adds Shivuri.
