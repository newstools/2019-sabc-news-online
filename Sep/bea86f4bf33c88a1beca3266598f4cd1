The Nelson Mandela Foundation says it accepts Tuesday’s court judgement in their case against Afriforum CEO Ernst Roets regarding his display of the old South African flag. The High Court in Johannesburg ruled that Roets was not in contempt of court for posting a picture of the old flag on Twitter. The Nelson Mandela Foundation had submitted an urgent application to the court after Roets displayed the old flag on Twitter just hours after the Equality Court ruled that the gratuitous displays of the flag constituted hate speech, harassment and unfair discrimination. The Foundation’s Luzuko Koti says they will study the judgement in detail to ascertain if further action can be pursued. Koti says: “We accept the judgement. We think that this process we engaged in is an important one for our democracy but also for the rule of law.” “I think for us as the foundation, it would be irresponsible to comment on the judgement itself primarily because the judge gave a summary judgement and I think we need to go and read the full judgement and understand where he is coming from and what his judgement was based on and then think about our next steps.”
