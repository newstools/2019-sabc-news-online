Former SABC Chief Operating Officer (COO) Hlaudi Motsoeneng, will continue with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. Last week, the commission heard how relentless Motsoeneng was in his attempts to interfere with the public broadcaster’s editorial mandate. The Public Protector at the time, Thuli Madonsela, found that Motsoeneng had lied about his qualifications and paid himself generous increases. The SABC eventually fired Motsoeneng for bringing the public broadcaster into disrepute. On Tuesday, he admitted to editorially interfering at the public broadcaster, saying that it was in fact his job. “It was my job to interfere because their argument is that they are independent. The question we need to ask is independent to whom, if they are independent because independency is an organisation not an individual. It is an organisation, independent in the Broadcasting Act. Chairperson, it’s clear the independence of the broadcaster or broadcasters not individuals,” says Motsoeneng. Watch a related video below:
