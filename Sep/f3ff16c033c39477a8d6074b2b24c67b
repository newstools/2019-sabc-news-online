Schooling has been disrupted in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni after fake news about child abductions made the rounds. Parents rushed to schools to pick up their children following a message that children were being kidnapped and schools burned. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has been visiting the area to calm the situation. He says he will be holding a meeting to ask parents to let their children go to school on Thursday. “This message unfortunately created panic and parents started to remove their children from school but upon investigation it was clear this is fake news no one has burned either disrupted or attacked our schools.” “We are urging parents to allow their children to come back to school tomorrow, today unfortunately schools have been disrupted in this area we are holding a community meeting around 4 o’clock.”
