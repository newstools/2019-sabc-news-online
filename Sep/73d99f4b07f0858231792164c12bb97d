Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has granted a two-week extension for submissions regarding the future of e-tolls. Organisations like OUTA have been campaigning against etolls in Gauteng since the gantries became operational in 2012.Â They say there was insufficient public consultation, and that there are more efficient ways to pay for highways. The Gauteng government has said it would like to see the scrapping of etolling and the Western Cape administration has also taken action on the matter. Mbalula was to have submitted a report on the e-toll matter to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday. However, he says he has granted a two-week extension for submissions on e-tolls in a bid to allow for further consultations with NGOs, labour and other interested parties.
