Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) president Joseph Mathunjwa says the new labour relations laws to be implemented next year, are an attack on unions. Mathunjwa was re-elected as president of AMCU for the fourth time at the unionâ€™s elective conference on Friday. He was elected unopposed. He says the new legislation will disable unions. AMCU says they will fight back against the legislation which requires a secret ballot before a strike can go ahead. AMCU has the largest number of members within the platinum industry. Mathunjwa expressed his gratitude to members at the Congress in his acceptance speech. He has also promised to continue to fight for the rights of the labourers. He criticised government for caring less for the less fortunate and working population.
