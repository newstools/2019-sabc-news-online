The family of late former Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe say they want to be compensated by his party ZANU-PF. Mugabe’s body is expected to arrive in his childhood village of Kutama on Monday for a wake. Authorities and family members are still discussing how to preserve the body until his burial in around a month’s time. A site is also being prepared for Mugabe’s body at Heroes Acre in Harare. The funeral service for the Zimbabwean statesman took place on Saturday. The Mugabe family says their hearts still bleed for the betrayal of ZANU-PF towards Mugabe when he was removed from office in 2017. His cousin, Augustine Chidakwa says: “They must compensate our family for what they did. It’s like killing someone, when you kill someone you must compensate.” “An apology won’t be enough, they must pay Mombe. In shona, kuRipa goze, they must otherwise we are not happy about the apology,” says Chidakwa. Watch video below:
