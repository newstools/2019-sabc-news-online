Cooperative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says South Africa could benefit from opening its borders to other African countries. Dlamini-Zuma was speaking during a ceremony to inaugurated her as the first female chancellor of the University of Limpopo. She says recent attacks on foreign nationals have the potential to damage the country’s reputation on the continent. Dlamini-Zuma, however says, should the open border system be implemented, strict measures should be in place to root out foreign nationals with bad intentions. “Rwanda has actually opened its borders to every African. You can fly from here straight to Rwanda without a visa. But that has not flooded Rwanda, because people know they can come and go from Rwanda. So, I think it’s a lesson that we must learn. However, we should also make a distinction between those who come to our country illegally. So, those should be deported. We should also make a distinction from those who are here and commit crime. Those should be treated like criminals.”
