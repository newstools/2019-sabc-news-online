The community of Kliptown Township in Soweto has threatened court action against the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development (DID). This follows the DID’s plans to spend R7 billion on the Kopanong Precinct Development project, which the community say smacks of poor planning on the part of the Gauteng government and undermines their needs. Formerly known as the Gauteng Provincial Government Precinct, the project was launched in 2003 to accommodate all government officials in 21 buildings in downtown Johannesburg. At the heart of the Kliptown residents’ grievances is the Gauteng government’s housing backlog, which they say should take priority over office space refurbishment. “While the government has for many years neglected this community without providing housing, despite numerous unfulfilled promises to build houses, they find it shocking that they want to commit R7 billion to rearrange buildings for office space,” reads in part a statement released earlier on Wednesday by the Kliptown Community Forum. “The housing backlog in the province is above 1 million mark, (200 000 in the City of Johannesburg) yet the government is still prioritising offices over housing for the people.” According to the statement, the community is calling upon government, which it accuses of poor planning, to halt the project. “… particularly Premier David Makhura to straightaway instruct the DID to stop Kopanong Precinct Development plans immediately.”
