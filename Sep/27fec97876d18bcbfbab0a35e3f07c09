The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Hawks have contradicted one another in parliament regarding access to a Steinhoff audit report on accounting irregularities at the company. Specialised Commercial Crimes Head Alfred Khana told a meeting of parliamentary committees, looking into the Steinhoff share price collapse of 2017, that they are unable to proceed with investigations because they had not been given the report. It turned, however, that the Marshall Mokgatle of the NPA, which co-wrote their presentation to parliament with the Hawks, expressed satisfaction with the access they had. “At the last sitting the former Chairperson went as far as instructing Steinhoff to release that report to us as the police. We have been saying we are waiting for the report. We don’t have access. Now it must be stated up front that we did not get that report from Steinhoff. There’s team of prosecutors guiding the hawks, guiding the investigation. Prosecutors and the hawks had access to the PWC report,” says Mokgatle.
