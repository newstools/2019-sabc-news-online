Senior Hawks investigator, Kobus Roelofse will continue with his testimony at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday. Roelofse has already been testifying for two days. He earlier revealed how a Crime Intelligence Unit’s secret service account was abused to benefit the unit’s senior officials. He was the lead investigator in the criminal trial of former Intelligence Unit’s Head, Richard Mdluli. Roelofse says his probe led him to the discovery of the looting of the slush fund. He told the commission that the fund was also used to pay reporters to write articles – as instructed by Solomon Lazarus – who was the financial head of the secret service account. “An amount of R143 621.78 was paid from Atlantis motors business account to Wesbank vehicle finance account in a settlement agreement of a vehicle registered in the name of Ranjeni Munusamy and as far as I know she’s a journalist. It reflected as received on the same date as the Wesbank vehicle account held in the name of Ranjeni Munusamy – this amount was debited against Atlantis Motors’ Beruit account on the 30th of July 2008,” says Roelofse.
