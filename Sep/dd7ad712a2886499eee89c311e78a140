Police Minister Bheki Cele says as police they are satisfied with the crime statistics that were released on Thursday. He says this year’s official statistics were certified by the Statistician General in partnership with the Police Commissioner. Cele pleaded with community members and those who are affected by crime, to not give up reporting crime if and when it happens. He says these stats are a true reflection of work that still needs to be done to reduce high level of crimes committed in different parts of the country. “For the first time this year crime statistics have been certified by the Statistician General. There has been MOU signed by the national commissioner of the South African police and statistician general that all police crime stats have been subjected to the known and standardise methodologist so that they can be regarded and be declared as official statics. So far we are very satisfied as the South African police, whoever wants to question them further can speak to Statistician General.” Listen for more: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/744720">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
