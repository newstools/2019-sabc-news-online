Six-year-old Amy-Lee de Jager, who was kidnapped by a group of men outside her school in Vanderbijlpark on Monday morning, has been found. The Laerskool Kollege Park learner was found unharmed on Tuesday morning. De Jager was kidnapped by a group of four suspects driving a white Toyota Fortuner, who later demanded a R2 million ransom. Apparently, the kidnappers, who were not paid ransom, dropped the little girl near her home on Tuesday and left. A family member also says results of a medical examination have confirmed that she was not harmed. The national police spokesperson, Vish Naidoo, says no arrests have been made: “We want to appeal to all to please allow for this investigation to take its course. Investigators are investigating both her disappearance and her sudden return and we would really appreciate if the investigations can be allowed to take its course.”
