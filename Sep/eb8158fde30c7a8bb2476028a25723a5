Members of Parliamentâ€™s Sub Rules Committee have agreed that a panel must be appointed by the Speaker to investigate whether prima facie evidence exists for a head of a Chapter 9 Institution to be removed. This, as the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, instructed the Rules Committee to start a process of drawing up draft rules for the removal of the head of a Chapter 9 Institution. Currently Parliament does not have rules in place for such a process. The instruction by Modise follows a request by the Democratic Alliance (DA) for the removal of the current Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The Sub Rules Committee has resolved that the process to remove the Head of a Chapter 9 institution, must go through four stages. The first is an initiation process followed by a preliminary assessment for prima facie evidence then an inquiry by a committee and a final decision must be taken by the National Assembly.
