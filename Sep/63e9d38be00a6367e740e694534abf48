The Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) says the suspension of over 200 of its firefighters will not have an impact in is ability to render services. The Johannesburg EMS says the workers were suspended for engaging in an unprotected strike in July. The city has about 1350 firefighters. Johannesburg EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says all their 30 fire stations are fully operational. “We have suspended over 200 firefighters. They involved themselves in an illegal strike. They were having a dispute in terms of supervisory practice when they respond to emergencies. As you know we are essential service, we don’t involve ourselves in protest action. So as an organisation we decided to put them on suspension.”
