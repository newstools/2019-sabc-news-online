Confusion is reigning as a tussle between the family of  late former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and the country’s government becomes apparent. The two are at loggerheads over the arrangements for Mugabe’s funeral. In a statement, the family has raised concerns about what it says is a lack of consultation on the programme and burial which have not taken into account his final wishes. Mugabe died in a hospital in Singapore on Friday at the age of 95. His body arrived on Wednesday at the capital Harare at the international airport which is named after him. While the family says it is willing to work with the government it insists that proceedings must conform to the late former President’s final wishes. Among these it stipulates that his wife Grace never leave his casket until he is finally buried. This raises questions as to which parts of the proceedings she was to be excluded from.
