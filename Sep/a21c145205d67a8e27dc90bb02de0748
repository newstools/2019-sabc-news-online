Johannesburg’s Metrobus says one of its busses has been hijacked Monday morning as some drivers embark on a strike action. The bus driver escaped unharmed. The bus was travelling from Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg, headed for Ghandi Square in the CBD to pick up passengers. Metrobus has described this as an act of intimidation. Metrobus spokesperson Goodwill Shiburi says, “We are able to operate over 80% of our buses. But the moment you have intimidation and cases like that it sends wrong message to those who want to work. We need to make sure that our drivers are safe and passengers are safe. But at the moment we are assessing the situation and if it continues with intimidation we might halt the service.” Some Metrobus commuters will have to find alternative means of transport as members affiliated to the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (DEMAWUSA) down tools on Monday. Employees are demanding a salary increase and union office space in all three depots in Johannesburg. Shiburi says the southern part of Johannesburg, the eastern parts of Johannesburg, including the inner city and parts of Parktown will be affected by the strike. He says negotiations will continue as planned. “A strike is not in the best interest of our passengers and given the number of people that will be embarking on strike, we are able to operate the service and I’m hoping that it’s only going to be a few routes affected,” adds Shiburi.
