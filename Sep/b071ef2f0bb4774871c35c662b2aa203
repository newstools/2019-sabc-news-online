British royal couple, Prince Harry and Meghan kick off the second day of their visit to the Mother City with a beach event on Tuesday.  They will witness the work of NGO, Waves for Change at Monwabisi Beach on the False Bay coast, where surf mentors provide mental health services to vulnerable young people – a subject close to Harry’s heart. They will also meet up with Royal marines and visit the Bo-Kaap as part of Heritage day celebrations. Their Royal Highnesses will also learn about the work of the Commonwealth Litter Programme which funds research and action to tackle plastic waste. Later on Tuesday morning, Prince Harry, who is Captain-General of the Royal Marines, will meet with members of South Africa’s Maritime Police Unit who receive training from the Royal Marines. In the afternoon, the Royal couple will visit the Auwal Mosque, the oldest mosque in South Africa, where they will view the first known manuscript of the Qu’ran in South Africa before meeting members of different faith groups. The day’s programme will end with a reception at the High Commissioner’s Residence. Click on the videos below:
