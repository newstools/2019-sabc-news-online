Disgruntled African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) members from branches in Lejweleputswa, one of the five districts of Free State province, have embarked on a march through the streets of Welkom. They are demanding the disbandment of the region’s league leadership saying its time in office has lapsed. The league members also accuse their leadership for failing to represent their needs and using the resources of the organisation for their benefits. They are expected to handover the memorandum to the league’s provincial secretary.
