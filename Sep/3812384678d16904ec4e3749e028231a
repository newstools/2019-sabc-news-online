ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has called on teachers across the country to make sure the quality of education in South Africa improves. He was addressing about 1 500 delegates attending the 9th SADTU National Congress at Nasrec, Johannesburg. He says he’s aware of teachers’ challenges such as violence that they face inside and outside the classroom everyday. Ramaphosa however says they should not stop trying to raise the quality of education to levels that compare competitively internationally “We thank you for the work that you do, even as the general secretary is saying – you are not remunerated as you wish. I stand here before you to say thank you. Your congress happens at a time where there are many challenges, at a number of levels.”  Click video below:
