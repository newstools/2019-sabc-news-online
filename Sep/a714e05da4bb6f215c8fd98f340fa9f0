Hundreds of people have gathered in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats to pray for peace following a spike in gender- based violence. A number of churches and faith-based organisations have joined the prayer service. Protests erupted in Cape Town last week following the murder of 19-year-old University of Cape Town student, Uyinene Mrwetyana and 19-year-old University of the Western Cape student Jesse Hess. Mrwetyanaâ€™s body was found in Khayelitsha. Hess and her grandfather were murdered recently in Parow.  Click below for other prayer sessions held across SA:
