The African National Congress’s (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule says a decision on the embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will be made on Tuesday. The Top Six officials of the governing party met with the Kwa-Zulu Natal provincial leadership to discuss her fate. Magashule says Gumede has made the commitment to abide by whichever decision they are going to make. “We will conclude this matter by tomorrow (Tuesday) having listened to both sides… Comrade Zandile and the others, as well the leadership of KZN. We hope that this matter will receive the necessary attention, and it will be resolved by tomorrow, amicably by all parties,” says Magashule. Last week, Gumede resigned as the Executive mayor of the City, but later retracted her resignation. Magashule says the decision on her fate will be communicated within the next 24 hours.
