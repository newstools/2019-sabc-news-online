The bail application of the man accused of murdering his girlfriend and burying her body in a shallow grave inside his shack in Vlakfontein, south of Johannesburg, is expected to resume in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto on Monday morning. Thokozani Sibeko’s case was postponed last month due to a strike by legal aid workers which included lawyers. He faces charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Police found the body of his 41-year-old girlfriend two months after she had disappeared. Sibeko allegedly confessed to one of his friends at a shebeen that he had killed his girlfriend and buried her body in a shallow grave under his bed. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko also confirmed to SABC NEWS that Sibeko allegedly confessed to having committed other murders as well, prompting the MEC to urge the community of Vlakfontein to come out and report any missing relative. During his previous court appearance,  Sibeko initially declined to be represented by a state lawyer, saying he wanted to tell his own story but later changed his mind after the Magistrate said it would be impossible for him to apply for bail without a lawyer.  He remains behind bars.
