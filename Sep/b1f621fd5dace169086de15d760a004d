The Eastern Cape government will on Saturday commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Bhisho Massacre. The massacre occurred on 7 September 1992 when the Ciskei government soldiers gunned down 28 African National Congress (ANC) members and wounded hundreds of others during a march. They were protesting against former Ciskei homeland ruler, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. It is estimated that over 20 000 took part in the march, which started in King William’s Town towards Bhisho to hand over a petition to Gqozo. General manager at the Arts and Culture Department, Sakhiwo Sondo, says they will ensure that the massacre is commemorated. “It is to remember those people who fell during the time of the Bhisho massacre. In the province, we have a number of sites of historical significance. The Bhisho massacre site constitutes one of three sites in the province that are recognised nationally that are supported by the Department of Arts and Culture as part of the resistance and liberation heritage root. So we will be going to Bhisho, targeting to commemorate the event with 500 people,” says Sondo.
