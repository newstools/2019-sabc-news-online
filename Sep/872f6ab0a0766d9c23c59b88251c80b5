Gauteng police are investigating the alleged gang rape of a Grade R boy by fellow learners inside a classroom at a primary school in Tsakane East of Johannesburg. The incident reportedly happened last week. Authorities are also investigating allegations by the child’s mother that she was not assisted when she went to report the matter at the local police station. The Gauteng Education Department is reportedly aware of the incident and is looking into it. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says a case against the four learners has now been registered. “The child himself will be taken for counselling and the boys will be placed on probation and assisted.”
