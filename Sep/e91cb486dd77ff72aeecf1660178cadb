Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has attributed the now postponed protest in the banking industry to what she says are the ‘banks’ failure to re-skill employees’. Earlier this week, Business Unity South Africa obtained an interdict against the planned protest. However, workers who are members of the South African Society of Bank Officials say they still intend to protest over mass retrenchments as banks go digital. Ndabeni-Abrahams was speaking during the celebration of the International Day for Universal Access to Information at the University of Pretoria. “We need to improve on the enrolment of the digital skills that we must provide the citizens with. Because we can give internet to all but if people don’t know how to participate in the internet space then they will end up being victims. Now our’s is to say how do we use these platforms that are available to us to drive the right messaging so that people can be able to identify solutions to their own problems without them looking upon government to so do?” Click on the video below:
