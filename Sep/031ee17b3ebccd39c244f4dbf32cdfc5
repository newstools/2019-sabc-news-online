The AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini says President Cyril Ramaphosa has written to him to inform him that a delegation of ministers would like a meeting with his Majesty to discuss the land issue. This relates to the Ingonyama Trust which administers more than 2.8 million hectares of land in KwaZulu-Natal under which he is sole trustee. The AmaZulu King was addressing maidens who are attending the 2019 Reed Dance in Nyokeni palace in KwaNongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal. “In one of the letters, I wrote to President Ramaphosa. I invited him to come here where I will call my nation for him in a stadium, where he will address my nation on the issue of land. We were to give him a platform, to tell my subjects if he has any plans as far as our land is concerned… Ramaphosa told the Parliament that he received my letter. Today, I can also confirm that Ramaphosa has sent me a letter to inform me that he will be sending a delegation of ministers to further the land issue, although I do not know what those ministers will say upon their arrival.” Watch the video below for more on the story:  The King has also called on men to protect women and children.  He has called for an end to violence in which foreign nationals are being targeted in some parts of Gauteng. He has criticised government officials for trying to meet with some traditional leaders from some hostels, saying this creates the impression that his subjects are attacking foreign nationals.
