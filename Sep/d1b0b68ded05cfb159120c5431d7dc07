Police Minister Bheki Cele has met with the Indunas and residents of Jeppestown in Johannesburg to end the looting and violence at foreign owned shops. Chief Induna in Gauteng, Simphiwe Mhlongo says the violence must come to a stop. Cele says he’s going to have an Imbizo with residents on Sunday. “They agreed that we meet on Sunday. And we hope that as law enforcement, we will work hard to prevent everything that would be coming before Sunday, and Sunday we will be working hard and I hope that we would be able to find a final solution,” says Cele.  Earlier, President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the recent violence and looting that has plagued some parts of Gauteng and Kwa Zulu-Natal. More than 100 people were arrested nationwide. Ramaphosa said he would be meeting with the Minister to discuss a way forward. He says such violent acts by South Africans should not be justified “I want it to stop immediately. The people of our country want to live in harmony and whatever grievance and concerns that people have we need to handle it in a democratic way. We need to handle it by discussing concerns and problems so there is just no justification for any South African to go out of their way to attack people from other countries. This must be stopped.”
