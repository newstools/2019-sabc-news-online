President Cyril Ramaphosa has cautioned police officials that they will face prosecution should they be found to be working with drug dealers in the country. President Ramaphosa gave the warning as he addressed a crowd in Katlehong on Gauteng’s east rand. He used the opportunity to further address the scourge of attacks on foreign nationals and gender-based violence in recent times. The area has been one of the hotspots for the attacks on foreign nationals over the past weeks. President Ramaphosa – speaking in English and then switching to isiZulu  – says corrupt police officials will find themselves in big trouble. “The last thing we want to hear is that the police are working with drug dealers and they are protecting drug dealers. People have been saying that they see police officers visiting the places where drugs are being sold. They are saying they see the police protecting drug dealers and those police officers working with drug dealers will get arrested as well.” Click on the video below:
