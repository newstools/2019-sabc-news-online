Senior Hawks investigator, Kobus Roelofse has told the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, how his efforts to investigate former head of Crime Intelligence, Richard Mdluli were frustrated. Roelofse is on his third day of testimony about his investigation of Mdluli which led to the discovery of the alleged looting of the secret service account. He says the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) Lawrence Mrwebi was deliberate in his attempts to stop the investigation into Mdluli’s conduct. “This was not just resistance. It was a deliberate attempt not to continue with the investigation. I thought that if the NPA says to the SAPS the matter is closed, the matter will not be dealt with, it will not be investigated further. But in this regard, to me it was quite deliberate to stop the investigation,” says Roelofse.

This after the Commission heard on Wednesday that Mdluli used the unit’s secret slush fund to travel overseas. Roelofse testified that Mdluli personally benefited from the unit’s slush fund. Mdluli says it would be difficult for him to comment on classified information. “As a trained member of SAPS and an intelligence person, it would be difficult for me to comment on classified information. I can only comment at the right time like when I did brief the Parliament on intelligence and I briefed other structures such as the AG. Those are the areas one can explain what was happening in that environment. I don’t have a problem with that (appearing before the Zondo Commission). Even tomorrow I can go.“
