The Wyebank community west of Durban is traumatized over the death of four children who have allegedly been killed by their father. The body of the oldest sister of three children who were found hanged in their home in Wyebank in Pinetown, west of Durban, has also been found. Police spokesperson, Thembeka Mbhele, says the body of the 17-year-old was found hanging in bushes in New Germany. This after her mother found the three children aged 4, 6 and 10 hanged in two rooms in their home. Mbhele says the police are still looking for their father, who is the last person who was seen with them: “The child was found at a bush in New Germany. She was hanged. Since yesterday the police have been working hard to find the culprit. We are looking for the father of these children because he is the last person who was seen with the children, even at home he is the last person who was seen with them.” Watch a related video below:
