Judge Segopotje Mphahlele says she could not find any reason to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence in the case of a 24-year-old woman who was convicted of killing her four children. Zinhle Maditla has been given four life jail terms by the High Court sitting in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. She had pleaded guilty to intentionally poisoning her children at Klarinet in Emalahleni in December last year due to the anger she had against her boyfriend. This is how Judge Mphahlele handed down the judgment, “I am of the considered view that the life imprisonment on each of the murder counts is the appropriate sentence and as a result I sentence the accused as follows for the murder of the little Minenhle Maditla, you’re hereby sentenced to life imprisonment. In respect of the murder of the little Blessing Maditla, you’re hereby sentenced to life imprisonment. In respect of the murder of Shaniqua Maditla,  you’re hereby sentenced to life imprisonment. In respect of the murder of the little Ivan Maditla, you’re also sentenced to life imprisonment.”
