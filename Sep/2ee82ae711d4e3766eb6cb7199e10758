Police Minister Bheki Cele says criminality will not be tolerated in South Africa. Cele has visited the satellite police station that was burnt earlier this week, allegedly by some students of the University of Zululand in KwaDlangezwa near eMpangeni on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Thirteen students have been arrested for burglary and being in possession of stolen property. It’s alleged that the students broke into the university book store and vandalised it. This after days of violent protest by the students over safety and accommodation issues, but Minister Cele says criminality will not be tolerated. “We will deal with those criminals, because they are criminals. We will treat them as such. It’s like if you burn state institutions you are a criminal and must be dealt with like one. “You can’t burn down the only police station you have just because you want another one. So, they must carry on and come report to this police station with ashes. We will not build another one. There are many places in this country that want police stations,” says Cele.
