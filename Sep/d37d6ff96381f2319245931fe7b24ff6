The Banking Association of South Africa (Basa) says it will return to the drawing board to engage unions, government and banks on the way forward. This is after Business Unity South Africa (Busa) succeeded in getting an interdict to stop a protest in the banking sector which was to take place on Friday. Basa says it respects the right of workers to protest, but a solution must be found. Members of the South African Society of Banking Officials (Sasbo) organised the protest. They are demanding an end to retrenchments and digitisation in the banking sector. “It’s unfortunate that we had to go to court to get an interdict because if proper procedures were followed and Section 77 notice was issued we wouldn’t have gone to court.  I think what we need to now do is to get to National Economic Development and Labour Council  (Nedlac) and discuss the underlying issues that actually created a situation in the economy where retrenchments actually need to be considered,” says Basa’s Cas Coovadia.
