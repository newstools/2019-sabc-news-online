The South African High Commissioner to Uganda, Professor Solly Mollo, says those who are perpetrating violence in South Africa should be condemned. His statement comes as concern grows across Africa over the violence in which some foreign nationals are being targeted in South Africa. In Uganda, lawmakers are demanding that the Foreign Affairs Ministry secure the safety of the country’s citizens living in South Africa. The violence and looting of shops occurred in Johannesburg and surrounding areas. Similar incidents occurred in Pretoria. Nigeria summoned its South African High Commissioner to express displeasure over the treatment of its citizens and it dispatched a special envoy. Nigeria also called for the boycott of South African companies in the west African nation. Mollo says, “This is not time for us to start blaming one another. People have lost their lives. People have lost their livelihoods. It is time for us to reflect and reconnect. We belong to one continent. We are one people.” Meanwhile, the Catholic Church in Johannesburg will use the Day of Prayer on Sunday to break the silence against gender-based violence and xenophobia. It says it will encourage people to speak up about this social ill. The Catholic Church has responded to government’s call for a day of prayer by convening a special prayer meeting on Sunday afternoon at St Margaret’s Catholic Church at Diepkloof in Soweto. Convenor of the prayer meeting Father Mduduzi Ndlovu says men, women and children of all faiths are welcome to attend the prayer which will end with a healing and reconciliation service.
