Zimbabwean President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has praised his predecessor, Robert Mugabe  for his vision and fortitude. Mnangagwa was speaking on Saturday at the state funeral of Mugabe at the National Stadium in Harare. He told his African counterparts and the world about the new path he said Zimbabwe was embarking on and demanded the lifting of sanctions. “There is no place in our modern world for punitive unilateral sanctions imposed in pursuit of selfish interests, undue influence in colonial time expansionism. As we mourn our icon we call for the unconditional and immediate lifting of the sanctions imposed on us. We invite the world to work and walk with us in the brighter future for our people. A Zimbabwe free of the albatross of sanctions is indeed a better Zimbabwe for the world.” For more watch video below:
