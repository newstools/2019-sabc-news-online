The South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) has condemned the behaviour of 702 reporter Barry Bateman after he was caught on camera using foul language allegedly aimed at Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema. The Media house Primedia has since apologised to Malema for Bateman’s actions and said that it will launch an investigation. The EFF rejected Primedia’s apology.  The forum said in a statement that it does not condone unprofessional behaviour. It has also urged people not to use the incident to attack journalists. “We believe this should not be used as an excuse to trigger an all-out attack on the media and journalists as a collective. Rather than a verdict being debated on social media, we ask that this matter be dealt with via the media house concerned.” SANEF has also condemned threats levelled against journalists. This follows an incident on Wednesday where Journalists Alex Mitchley of News24, Hanti Otto of Netwerk24 and Pule Letshwiti from Etv were threatened by a witness at the trial of rape accused, Nicholas Ninow. Mitchley alleges that the witness was upset at being named by the media.
