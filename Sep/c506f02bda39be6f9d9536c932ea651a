The International Organisation for Migration has facilitated Thursday’s repatriation of more than 150 Mozambican nationals. This is according to the Mozambican embassy, which has been assisting its citizens to leave South Africa. Their repatriation follows last weeks violent attacks on foreign nationals in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, as well as in other parts of Gauteng. The Mozambicans who left the country on Thursday together with 98 Zimbabweans were uprooted from their homes at the Mandela informal settlement and Nhlapo section in Katlehong east of Johannesburg. Mozambican Consul General Gilyaan Tamele says: “We are working with the international organisation for migration who are sponsoring their transport and all the facilities they will be getting when they arrive home. Because when they get there they will be taken to a centre there is a place after the border, about 60 kilomiters or so from the border there is where they will be accommodated. They will be screened again and will be taken to their different destinations.” Earlier, almost 100 Zimbabwean nationals who’ve been living in community halls in Katlehong were repatriated to their country of origin. A total of 98 Zimbabwean nationals went through their final documentation processes with Home Affairs officials at the Tsolo hall in Katlehong. This before boarding the buses that took them back home. Officials from the City of Ekhurhueni were on hand dishing out food parcels and clothing to the women and children as they prepared to make their long journey to the Beit Bridge border post and into Zimbabwe.
