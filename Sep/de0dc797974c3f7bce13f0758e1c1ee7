The Izinduna in Gauteng have disputed claims that they have given government ministers 24-hours to address them on their issues concerning foreign nationals. This follows Saturday looting in central Johannesburg. The incidents were preceded by former Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) President Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s failed meeting with hostel dwellers about the violence targeting foreign nationals. Chief Induna in Gauteng Simphiwe Mhlongo says they condemn the criminal activities and the killing of people. “It was said by the people on the floor it was not said by us Izinduna. We never made any demands – it was those people who were unruly; they did not behave well because they wanted the government to be present because they say Shenge has no answers.”  Related video click below:
