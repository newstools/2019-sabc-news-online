President Cyril Ramaphosa has told a restive crowd at the National Stadium in Harare that the late Zimbabwean statesman, Robert Mugabe, played a crucial role in the liberation of South Africa. President Ramaphosa was jeered by the crowd as he prepared to speak. Officials appealed for silence so that President Ramaphosa could begin his address. This comes on the back of a wave of attacks on foreign nationals in Gauteng. At least 12 people were killed in the violence – ten of whom were South African nationals. Shops of foreign nationals were among those burnt and looted. South Africa has been condemned by a number of African countries for the recent attacks on foreign nationals. Ramaphosa has told the crowd that South Africa owes a debt of gratitude to Mugabe and Zimbabwe. He told the crowd that his administration is working hard to encourage a welcoming attitude among South Africans toward foreign nationals – including those from neighbouring Zimbabwe. #RIPMUGABE President Cyril Ramaphosa booed in Zimbabwe as he takes to the podium. This is obviously related to Xenophobia. Ramaphosa tells the crowd he regrets what happened in South Africa and apologises.#sabcnews pic.twitter.com/cLGG7DR6X7 — Chriselda Lewis ™️ (@Chriseldalewis) September 14, 2019
