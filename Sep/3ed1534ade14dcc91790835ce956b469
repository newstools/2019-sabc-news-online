African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) leader the Reverend Kenneth Meshoe says many Nigerian members of the Nigeria-South Africa Unity Forum acknowledged that many of their countrymen are involved in crime in South Africa. The aim of the forum is to provide a platform for healing for both South Africans and Nigerians following the recent violence in which foreign nationals were being targeted. Some businesses were looted and burnt and at least 13 people were killed in the violence. Reverend Meshoe says, “Well, the forum is just beginning to do its work. Many from a group of Nigerians have admitted that many or some among them have caused much harm in South Africa by being involved in drug trafficking and sex trafficking and so on. So, they say they want to apologise for that harm they have caused.”
