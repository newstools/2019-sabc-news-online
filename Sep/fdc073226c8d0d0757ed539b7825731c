On the eve of a jointing sitting address on gender-based violence by both houses of Parliament that President Cyril Ramaphosa has called, the Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling for radical legislative reforms to address the problem. Addressing journalists in Parliament earlier on Tuesday, the DA came up with what it called a nine-point Strategy proposing new pieces of legislation, including repealing the existing laws that deal with domestic violence. The party says in light of the recent spate of gender-based violence in the country, it challenges Ramaphosa to heed its call to legislate new laws. DA Chief in the National Assembly John Steenhuisen says it can no longer be business as usual. “What we want to do is to ensure that what is announced tomorrow (Wednesday) is not so much virtues. And what we have seen so often in this administration where you have this PR exercise with very little substance. What we want to do is to issue a real challenge to the President and to the governing party to say if you are really serious about this issue, here are nine concrete proposals that you can do relatively quickly that will make a big difference in addressing all sorts of these things. We have heard all sorts of things by the President for tomorrow (Wednesday). But we need to go beyond just government by announcements.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
