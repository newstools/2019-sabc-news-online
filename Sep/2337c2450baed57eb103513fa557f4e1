The Transport Department in the North West has confirmed that it has terminated a contract for the operation of a shuttle between Mahikeng and OR Tambo Airports. The contract was between the Department and aviation company, SA Express. Director responsible for Airports within the provincial department, Olebogeng Baikgaki, says they terminated the contract as they were not happy about the performance by the service provider. Baikgaki says the over R500 million deal, has since landed them at the State Capture Commission, as there were allegations of corruption surrounding the contract. “We were somehow not happy with their performance, we are still reviewing our SLA with them. They did not communicate with us until such time that we decided to terminate their service. We know about the corruption allegation, that came about with the SA Express contract, we were even called to the Zondo Commission to testify, unfortunately, some of those allegations were not actually true,” says Baikgaki.
