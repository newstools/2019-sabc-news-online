Residents living near the Sedibeng Regional Sewer Scheme in Sebokeng, in the Vaal area, will meet with the Deputy Minister of Water and Sanitation, David Mahlobo, on Monday, in an effort to resolve the impasse which has suspended work at the treatment plant. The meeting comes after Deputy President David Mabuza addressed angry residents on Thursday who are demanding employment at the treatment plant which has not been functioning well, leading to sewerage spilling into the Vaal River. Mabuza promised a cash injection of R1.1 billion into the treatment plant. Meanwhile community leader, Themba Nkuna, says he hopes the meeting with Mahlobo will be fruitful. “We really appreciate the Deputy President coming here and we are really hoping that whatever he is promising, that after two weeks, he wants to see progress and the job that continues. We really hope that that can happen. We are hoping that can be a meeting that can be fruitful for the community and the training that has been promised to the community. We really hope it can be done as soon as possible because the community is angry,” says Nkuna.
