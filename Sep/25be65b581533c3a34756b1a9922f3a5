The University of Witwatersrand (Wits) has called for decisive action to be taken to end gender-based violence, xenophobia and afrophobia on its campuses and in society. This follows the murder of 19-year University of Cape Town student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, who was laid to rest on Saturday. Wits will host an inter-faith service at its main campus in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Monday afternoon. The Wits Student Representative Council will also hand over a memorandum to the university executives. “For the first lecture of each day for this week, lecturers are requested to start each lecture with a moment of silence in memory of those whose lives have been lost to gender based violence and to xenophobia. The University says it strongly condemns all forms of violence, abuse and discrimination. It is calling on the state and relevant role-players to create a society in which everyone feels safe and secure regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, nationality and other factors,” says Shirona Patel, Wits spokesperson.
