The Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande says he is aware of challenges at the University of Zululand on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Violent protests by students against the high levels of crime at the university and off-campus student residences recently erupted. The students say they feel that the university is being neglected because it is situated in rural areas. Nzimande says the  institution is at the top of his priority list, and he is also planning to visit the local Inkosi under which the institution is situated. “The issue of the University of Zululand is at the top of my priority list. I am planning to visit all rural institutions including Ungoye. I also want to speak to students and unions to see how we can work around ensuring we help these universities that are based in rural areas. I will also go and speak to Inkosi uMkhwanazi where the University of Zululand is situated,” says Nzimande. Watch a related video below:
