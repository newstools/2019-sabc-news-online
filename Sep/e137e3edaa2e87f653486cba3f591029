The chairperson of the Security Cluster, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, has admitted that the government does not know who is behind the recent spate of violence and looting in parts of Johannesburg. Ministers serving on the cluster, consisting of State Security, Defence, Police, Home Affairs and Justice, briefed journalists in Parliament on Tuesday, on interventions to try and curb the violence. Mapisa-Nqakula says such information would also not be made public. The Defence minister says more than 700 people have been arrested since violence broke out on the first of this month. “The charges for arrested range from arson public violence damage to property, theft, possession of stolen property possession of illegal firearms, attempted murder, and murder and contravention of gatherings act.”    Meanwhile, Justice Minister, Ronald Lamola, says due process must be followed when granting or denying bail to anyone who has previously been convicted of a sex crime. Lamola was part of the security cluster briefing at Parliament about the interventions government aims to make to bring an end to gender-based violence. Lamola says while the Constitution provides guidance, judicial officers can also use their discretion. “We have to look into what constitution says, due process, but magistrates across the country are able to look at conditions and concerns of communities, like with parole… when rehabilitated, use your discretion to give parole… but laws allow for person using that discretion to regard the concerns of the communities.”
