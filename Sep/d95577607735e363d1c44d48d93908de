The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will write to Police Commissioner, Khehla Sitole, to deploy the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure to curb the ongoing violence across the country. The party’s spokesperson on Police in Parliament, Andrew Whitfield says they’ve noted violence in the form of attacks on foreign nationals, truck drivers and violent riots. Whitfield says these attacks have a direct effect on the country’s economy. “The recent violent attacks on SA roads are an attack on the economy and SAPS needs to act proactively in order to halt the economic sabotage that’s taking place on our roads, that is undermining economic growth and leading to more joblessness. DA is calling to activate Natjoints to ensure we can anticipate and prevent any further attacks on the logistic sector,” says Whitfield.
