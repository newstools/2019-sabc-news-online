The Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) has launched an investigation after a video surfaced on Twitter showing an allegedly drunk man in full EMPD uniform. It shows the man swaying a little before he is approached by other metro police officers, who take away his firearm after it nearly fell of the holster fastened to his hip. The video was taken at a parking lot of an unspecified shopping mall. Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesperson, Kobeli Mokheseng, says they are aware of the video.
