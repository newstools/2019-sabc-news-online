Nigeria’s Consul General, Godwin Adama says they are consulting authorities over the attacks on foreign-owned shops in Johannesburg and Pretoria. About 90 suspects have been arrested since the looting started in Jeppestown on Sunday and spread to Malvern, Tembisa, the Johannesburg CBD and Alexandra. Adama says they want the police to restore calm. “We have constantly been in touch with the South African authorities and some of the instances they have responded to our call to deploy. But I believe the situation has overwhelmed the security forces to the extent that many times in many of the places the looting goes on without anyone trying to stop it,” says Adama.
