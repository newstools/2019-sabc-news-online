Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) has advised consumers not to panic ahead of the South African Society of Bank Officials’ (Sasbo) planned strike on Friday. The Labour Court in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, is on Wednesday expected to make a ruling on the application for an interdict against the strike. BUSA has applied for an interdict to halt the nationwide strike by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) affiliate that is against the retrenchment of workers and the digitalisation of banking. “This is obviously a serious situation but our banks are geared to deal with the situation. Our banks will do everything in their power to minimise the impact. There could be huge pressure on Friday, we would urge customers to do their banking today and tomorrow. Banks will take the necessary precautions to ensure that cash machines are loaded,” says Cas Coovadia, BUSA Acting CEO. Sasbo says it’s not surprised that BUSA has approached the Labour Court to seek an interdict against the planned strike. Sasbo is against the retrenchment of workers and the digitalisation of banking. Sasbo General-Secretary, Joe Kokela, says news of a strike has come as a shock to BUSA. “They never thought the strike would happen. All along when we were talking to them, they thought that we were threatening. I told them that this thing is going to happen if they don’t give in. So now we are not surprised about what they are doing. We are going to oppose and we’re sure that we’ll be successful,” says Kokela.  Watch a related video below:
