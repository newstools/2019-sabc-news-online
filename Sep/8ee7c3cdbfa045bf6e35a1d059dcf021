Two suspects are expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday on charges of running an illicit abalone drying facility in Plattekloof. Ismael Mohamed (35) and Hirsi Mohamed (36) were arrested by the Hawks just over a week ago for being in alleged possession of wet and dry abalone worth about R4 million. Hawks spokesperson Philane Nkwalase said a firearm and ammunition were also found on the premises. Further investigations revealed that the firearm had been reported stolen at the Booysen police station in Johannesburg. The accused have been charged under the Marine Living Resources Act and for the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.
