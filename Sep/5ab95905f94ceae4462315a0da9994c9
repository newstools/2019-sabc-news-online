The trial of a mother accused of attempted murder is expected to start in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court north of Durban. This is after she allegedly dumped her new-born baby in a storm water drain in Newlands East at the beginning of the year. A passer-by heard the baby’s cries and the subsequent three hour rescue operation made international headlines. The woman, who may not be named to protect the identity of her three other children, was arrested in hospital a few days later. The rescued baby was placed in the care of the Social Development Department. The accused was granted bail of R5000.
