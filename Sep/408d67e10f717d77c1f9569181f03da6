The SABC Board  has condemned the leaking of a memorandum. The memorandum authored by two non-executive Directors, containing untested allegations, has been widely distributed to the media. The Board said in a statement that a memorandum by Deputy Chairperson Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi and Dr Marcia Socikwa was submitted for Board consideration. It alleged improper conduct by the SABC’s Group Chief Executive Officer, Madoda Mxakwe, and the Chief Financial Officer, Yolande van Biljon. The memorandum was not discussed by the Board as the document was distributed shortly before the meeting was set to commence. The SABC Board believes that the leaking of the memorandum is highly prejudicial to the SABC GCEO and CFO as it contains allegations that have not been tested. Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini says the leaks are an attempt to destruct the board.
