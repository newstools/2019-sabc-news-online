Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola said prison officials are also to blame for the smuggling of illegal items for inmates, while speaking at a raid at Durban’s Westville Prison last night. A number of items including drugs, home-brewed alcohol and cellphones were confiscated from inmates during the raid which was conducted in various cells that house inmates convicted of serious offences.  Lamola says they have introduced a procedure in which prison wardens will also be scanned when entering and leaving the prison. He said those who break the law will be decisively dealt with. “Obviously, there is communication between officials and inmates – that is why we have also introduced a process to search officials. The searches here are not only for inmates but also for officials,” added Lamola.
