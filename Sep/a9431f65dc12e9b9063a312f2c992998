The African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule has  appealed to members of the public to pay for municipality services. He says municipalities can only function properly if members of the public pay for services. Magashule was briefing the media in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, where the ANC National Executive Committee is holding a special meeting He says it is time for people to understand that they must pay for services. “We are saying to all our municipalities they must up their game and deliver services and make sure people pay for the services they get.” Magashule also  took the opportunity to warn under-performing municipal officials that strong action will be taken against them. He says the ANC will closely monitor developments in all municipalities it manages because it will not tolerate under-performance. “We are talking about consequence management, you don’t do what is expected of you, obviously there must be action.” WATCH BELOW:
