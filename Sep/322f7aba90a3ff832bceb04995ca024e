President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned the recent violence and looting that has plagued some parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.  A number of shops owned by foreign nationals in Gauteng were looted and torched and trucks driven by foreign nationals in KwaZulu-Natal were set alight. More than 100 people were arrested nationwide. Ramaphosa says he will be meeting with the Minister of Police Bheki Cele to discuss a way forward. He says such violent acts by South Africans should not be justified. “I want it to stop immediately. The people of our country want to live in harmony and whatever grievance and concerns that people have we need to handle it in a democratic way. We need to handle it by discussing concerns and problems. So, there is just no justification for any South African to go out of their way to attack people from other countries. This must be stopped,” says Ramaphosa.   Watch video below for more on the story:
