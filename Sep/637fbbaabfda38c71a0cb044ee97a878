Police Minister Bheki Cele will meet with community leaders from Denver and Cleveland hostels on Tuesday over the violence and looting of shops across Gauteng. Cele has condemned the violent attacks, describing them as acts of criminality that must be stopped. The violence and looting of shops belonging to foreign nationals started in Tshwane last week. They then spread to Johannesburg after three people died in a building in Jeppestown on Sunday. On Monday numerous shops were looted and vandalised in Malvern, Tembisa, Turfontein and the Johannesburg CBD. More than 100 people have been arrested for various offences including public violence, theft and damage to property since Sunday. Cele’s spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, says the Minister will meet the leaders of the two hostels because that’s where many of the looters are believed to have come from. “What has been happening is that people who were responsible for looting and some acts of violence in the past two days when they were being chased by the police they would run into these places. That’s the reason why the Minister will meet with the community from these hostels.” Related video click below:
