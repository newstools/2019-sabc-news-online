Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that he’s not there to defend himself but to tell the truth. Motsoeneng is appearing before the commission for the second consecutive day to respond to allegations that he interfered with the public broadcaster’s editorial mandate. He served as COO of the public broadcaster from 2011 to 2013 and was removed from the position after it was found out that he lied about his qualifications. Motsoeneng says he’s not happy with how the media has been reporting about his testimony. He says, “I’m concerned when the media reports that I’m here to defend myself. I’m not here to defend myself, I’m just telling the truth – the way I understand issues, chairperson. I’m not blaming anyone chairperson and the other point is the media, I think their role is to discredit me.” Watch video below:
