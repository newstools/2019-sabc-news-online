The Democratic Alliance (DA) has suspended its councillor in the Rand West City Local Municipality west of Gauteng. DA leader, John Moodey, says the councillor was arrested together with two others for allegedly robbing a business in Randfontein also on the West Rand. They were allegedly found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. “As the DA we do not condone any acts of criminality. He has to face the allegations against him. If police have enough evidence before the courts of law and if he’s found guilty, he has face the full might of the law and he has to face the music. The DA in the meantime had to suspend him. And once this matter has been concluded by the court of law further disciplinary action will be taken,” says Moodey.
