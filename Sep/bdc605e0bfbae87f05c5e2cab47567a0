President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the extension of the deployment of the SANDF to crime-ridden areas of the Western Cape until March the 31st 2019. The deployment of the army to the Western Cape was scheduled to officially end on Monday. The army was deployed in July following a series of gang-related murders. The recent crime stats show that the murder rate has increased by 3.4% while sexual offences have seen an increase of more than 4%. Ramaphosa has informed the Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Amos Masondo of the extension. In a statement the Presidency says members of the regular and reserve forces of the SANDF will undertake operations in cooperation with the police. It adds that they will support the prevention and combating of crime as well as maintaining and preserving law and order in the province. “President Ramaphosa commends all the law enforcement agencies for the work done so far.”  See some of the crime hotspots around the country on infographic below:  Loading… (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
