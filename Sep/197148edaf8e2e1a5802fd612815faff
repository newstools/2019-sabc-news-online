The KwaZulu-Natal Transport Department has dispatched a team of investigators to establish the cause of a crash in which six people were killed at KwaXimba near Cato Ridge on the province’s midlands. Another eight people were injured in the collision involving a truck and several vehicles on a district road near the Umsunduzi clinic. Two years ago, 20 people were killed on the same road when an overloaded vehicle they were travelling in veered off a bridge and rolled down an embankment. Department Spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane has cautioned motorists to obey rules of the road. “The preliminary investigation indicates that a truck lost control and collided into two vehicles. The truck also overturned and all the six people died on the scene. There are others who were taken to hospital and the recovery is still in progress. We wish to caution everyone who is driving on provincial roads to make sure that they adhere to all traffic rules. Currently, the team is on the scene to establish exactly what the cause of the accident was.”
