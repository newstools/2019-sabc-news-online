Deputy President David Mabuza has reiterated that an attack on a police officer, is an attack on South Africa. He delivered his Keynote Address at the Annual South African Police Service Commemoration Day at the SAPS Memorial site, Union Buildings, in Pretoria. Joined by Police Minister Bheki Cele and National Police Commissioner Khehla Sithole, Mabuza says fallen police heroes selflessly served the country. “ I’m greatly honoured as we commemorate the fallen heroes and heroine of the South African police officers. We are gathered here to solemnly honour these great men and women who selflessly saw to serve our country and indeed who served South Africa with distinction. We take this opportunity to salute these deceased heroes. A total of 27 police officers, including a reservist, have died between April last year and March this year. Mabuza says an active partnership between the police and the public will prevent the murder of police officers. He says police need the help of communities to root out crime. Whilst paying tribute to the fallen men and women in blue who put their lives on the line to keep South Africans safe, Mabuza paid homage to officers who served their communities without fear or favour. “To the families and colleagues, your loss is our loss. Your pain is our pain. Your grief is grief that is shared by all South Africans,” he told the families. “We say this as recognition that police officers are rare and steadfast patriots who place their lives, on a daily basis, on the line for the cause of keeping us all safe and protected. To the families of the heroes whose names are engraved in this memorial cite rest assured that their death was not in vain.”
