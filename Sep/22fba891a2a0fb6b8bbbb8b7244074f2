The Gauteng Provincial Government has voiced its confidence in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in its attempts to probe the Life Esidimeni tragedy. This after the NPA referred the Life Esidimeni docket for a formal inquest before a judge in the High Court in Pretoria. It comes three years after the Esidimeni tragedy in which 144 people died. Many of them died of starvation and neglect after the Gauteng Health Department cancelled their contract with Life Esidimeni, resulting in thousands of patients being transferred to facilities that were not licensed. In a statement, the NPA says the evidence at their disposal is not enough. “As the Gauteng Provincial Government, we continue to be confident that the NPA will do what they have to do. The matter has been referred to them following their investigation into the matter and we believe they are acting on those recommendations. We await the conclusion of this matter,” says Thabo Masebe, Gauteng Provincial Government Spokesperson. Watch a related video below:
