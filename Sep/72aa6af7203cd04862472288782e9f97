The Gauteng Community Safety Department has commended a Johannesburg Metro Police Officer for going the extra mile in attempts to stop a motorist from dodging a fine in Krugersdorp on Friday. In a 17-second video – currently doing the rounds on social media, a police officer can be seen hanging on to the bonnet of a moving vehicle. Law enforcement thereafter brought the vehicle to a stop. Gauteng Community Safety spokesperson, Ofentse Morwane, says the officer was attempting to issue the driver with a fine when the driver chose to drive away, with the officer desperately clinging to the car’s bonnet. “We want to commend the bravery of our officer in making sure that he stood his ground and ensured the work that needed to be done at the time. She was stopped for being on the phone and when the officer was issuing a fine, she decided to drive off. We can confirm that this person was arrested and charges were laid against her.” Click on the video below:
