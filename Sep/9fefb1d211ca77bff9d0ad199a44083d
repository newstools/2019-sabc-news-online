Nicholas Ninow has pleaded guilty to raping a seven-year-old girl in a toilet cubicle at the Dros restaurant in Silverton in Pretoria last year. He also pleaded guilty to defeating the ends of justice and possession of drugs at the High Court in Pretoria. However, he did not plead guilty to the charge of assault. He was found allegedly half dressed with the little girl in a toilet cubicle in the restaurant after she called for help. A doctorâ€™s report indicated her private parts were swollen, bruised and torn. Watch a related video below:
