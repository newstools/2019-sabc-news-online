President Cyril Ramaphosa says government is attempting to repair the damage caused by recent attacks on foreign nationals by sending a team of South African envoys to other African states. Ramaphosa was speaking after returning from former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s funeral service in Harare, where he apologised to the continent for the spate of attacks. At least 12 people were killed in the past few weeks and foreign-owned businesses were looted. Speaking at Grace Bible Church, in Soweto, on Sunday morning Ramaphosa said the envoys will again offer an apology on behalf of South Africa: “Our image, our standing, has been dented. I’ve taken steps to send envoys around various parts of the continent. “Jeff Radebe is going to Nigeria and west Africa. “I am sending other envoys to the AU and various countries to go and explain to them what has happened and to offer our apologies. For those who have been killed, our condolences, and for those injured as well. So we will be trying to repair the damage that has been caused by all this.”  Click on the video below:
