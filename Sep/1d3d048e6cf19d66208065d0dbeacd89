Mpumalanga Premier, Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane has challenged men to help in curbing the scourge of Gender-Based-Violence (GBV). Mtshweni-Tsipane led a public awareness walk-about against GBV in Moloto village, outside Kwamhlanga, in Mpumalanga. The walk follows an upsurge in the number of reported cases in the province and around the country. Mtshweni-Tsipane wants rape and all forms of crimes against women and children to come to an end. “We are saying we cannot sit back as government and fold our arms seeing this happening day in day out to our children. At some point, this has to stop and it has to stop now. We are saying enough is enough. We will join hands working with our civil organisations, our communities, our faith-based organisations and also our traditional leaders and healers.” The Department of Social Development in the province is offering assistance to GBV survivors. Community members say the thought of living in a world without the threat of women and children being abused brings relief. Mtshweni-Tsipane has called on all men to take a firm stand against gender-based violence, and allow women to live without fear of being attacked. Watch video below for more:
