President Cyril Ramaphosa has repeated the call to protect the women of South Africa against abuse. The President was addressing members of the community at Ekurhuleni on Gauteng’s East Rand, following the recent wave of looting and violence that has rocked the province. Ramaphopsa says it’s up to men to change their attitudes. “As the men of this nation, we must respect our women. We are called upon by the people of South Africa, we must respect the women of our country. They don’t deserve to be beaten up. They don’t deserve to be raped. They don’t deserve to be killed. Yebo.” Earlier, women staged a march to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in Sandton to raise awareness about gender-based violence and crimes against children.
