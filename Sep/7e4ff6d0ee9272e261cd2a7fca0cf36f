Nooitgedacht Primary School at Bishop Lavis and Cravenby High at Elsies River in Cape Town have received awards for the hashtag #MySmartChallenge. The awards recognise schools that save water through maintaining infrastructure. Spokesperson for the Western Cape Premier, Bianca Capzorio says these two schools saved the most water in the hashtag challenge. “They were the two schools who saved the most water in the hashtag SmartWaterChallenge. The challenge was started at the hype of a drought in the province and by measuring and tracking the use of water and instituting behavioural change, both learners and staff. The project has been able to save a total of about 515 million litres of water,” says Capzorio.
