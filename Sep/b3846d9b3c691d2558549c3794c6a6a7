Another group of foreign nationals fleeing the violent attacks in Gauteng is leaving South Africa. Almost 100 Zimbabwean nationals whoâ€™ve been living in community halls in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni are being sent to their country of origin. Earlier about 153 Mozambican nationals also left in three buses from a hall also in Katlehong. The foreign nationals were displaced after they fled from their homes at the Mandela informal settlement and Nhlapo section following violent attacks in Ekurhuleni last week. 98 Zimbabwean nationals are now going through their final documentation processes with Home Affairs officials at the hall in Katlehong before they board the buses that will be taking them back home. Their belongings have already been loaded onto trailers and some can be seen bidding farewell to their loved ones who have chosen to remain behind. Officials from the City of Ekurhuleni are also on hand, and have been dishing out food parcels and clothing to the women and children as they prepare to make their long journey to the Beit Bridge border post and into Zimbabwe.
