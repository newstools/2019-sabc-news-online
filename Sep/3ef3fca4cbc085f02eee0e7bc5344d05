Labour Minister Thulasizwe Nxesi says he will soon present a report which will outline the way forward in dealing with violence in the truck industry. Nxesi, together with his counterparts from the Home Affairs and Police departments, will hold a meeting following the ongoing violence, road blockades and intimidation of drivers. Nxesi says the report will assist with how truck owners can comply in the sector. Nxesi says harsh action will be taken against those who continue with violent acts. “What they need to know is that it’s not these truck drivers who are causing the problem. The issue is the truck owners, the employers. There is a programme that we will announce this week to ensure that they are aligned with what is meant to happen. They can’t hire a large number of foreign drivers, there has to be a certain percentage. Having said that, it doesn’t mean that foreign drivers should not be hired, they should, they also have rights.” Meanwhile, police are on high alert as members of the National Truck Drivers’ Foundation threaten to embark on a national shutdown of all major routes. The foundation is protesting against the employment of foreign nationals as drivers. On Sunday, two trucks were set alight on the N3 at Ashburton and on the N2 near Port Shepstone in KwaZulu-Natal. In both incidents, the drivers of the trucks were asked for their nationalities before the trucks were torched. Transport Department spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa says police presence has been increased on the N2 and N3 routes. “Police have put together an integrated plan working with the traffic police to increase police visibility on all major routes into the province. We would like to urge truck drivers to co-operate with the police to ensure that no damage to property and injuries take place.” Watch a related video below:
