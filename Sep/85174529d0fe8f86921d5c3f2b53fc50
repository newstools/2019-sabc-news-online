Hundreds of young people in Kenya have taken part in a strike to demand action from global leaders against climate change. The strike is in protest of the inaction by decision-makers to halt greenhouse gas emission responsible for global warming. They have called on the Kenyan government to stop plans to establish coal power plants and instead concentrate on 100% renewable energy. Waving banners and singing songs, the young people demanded that the Kenyan government and the global community takes more ambitious action against climate change. United Nations Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, will be convening a Climate Action Summit in New York on Monday to demand urgent action to combat climate change as per the Paris Climate Agreement. Scientists say global warming has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods.
