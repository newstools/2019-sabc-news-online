A blast in the centre of Afghanistan’s capital Kabul killed at least six people on Tuesday, police officials said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. “We are investigating whether it was a suicide attack or whether a magnetic bomb was attached to a motor-bike,” interior ministry spokesperson Nasrat Rahimi said. In a separate incident, an explosion near an election rally attended by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani killed 24 people.
In the same incident 31 people were injured. This happened in Charikar, capital of Parwan province, northof Kabul, health officials said. Taliban commanders have said they will intensify clashes with Afghan and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting in the September 28th presidential election. This is when Ghani will bid for a second five-year term.
