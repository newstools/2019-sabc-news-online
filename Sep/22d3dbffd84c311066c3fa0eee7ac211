The South African Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, the Reverend Thabo Makgoba has urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to demand that the relevant branches of government act swiftly to curb violence against foreign nationals. He was delivering his Sunday sermon. Makgoba says the violence cannot be tolerated. “We can’t be ambivalent; we can’t be insensitive to God’s people who happen to be from outside our borders. We condemn the violence meted out against them – and as Archbishop, I express our prayers for the traumatised and our condolences to those who have lost members of their families.” Click below for more on attacks on foreign nationals:
