The Special Investigating Unit’s Special Tribunal is set to begin efforts to recoup funds lost by the state from corruption or irregular spending after regulations governing the tribunal were gazetted last week. The tribunal will offer an alternative to the civil litigation that was previously followed by the SIU. Justice Minister Ronald Lamola last week said R14 billion could be recovered. Corruption Watch Executive Director David Lewis says, “We are delighted at the establishment of the tribunal which has been long provided for in the legislation. It will enable the SIU to fast track civil claims for the return of the money lost by the state.” “There is a lot of money involved and the SIU are a leading organisation attempting to tackle corruption. They will now have a dedicated court, a dedicated tribunal that they can go to recover money lost by the state,” says Lewis. WATCH
