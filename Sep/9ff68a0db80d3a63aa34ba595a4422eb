Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has expressed shock about the poor service delivery Kimberley residents are receiving. Mkhwebane paid a surprise visit to an office of the Sol Plaatje Municipality and the Galeshewe Day Hospital as part of her office’s outreach programme in the Northern Cape. Mkhwebane also met with the San community at Platfontein near Kimberley. “I went to the Galeshewe Municipal office; I think it was a concern to find that it was only junior officials who were there to service members of the community. The acting senior manager was not there, the next in charge was not there, they don’t know who is acting. When I engaged with them what they said is that they need to put their community first. We visited the hospital and also not impressed with the kind of service received.” Platfontein community leader, Wentzel Katjara says the lack of efficient service delivery is negatively affecting their daily lives. “We need the government to recognise the Khwe and San traditional leaders. One of the issues, very important, is in our school, we don’t have subjects like example biology, science and mathematics and so on.”
