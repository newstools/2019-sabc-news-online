The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it will investigate leaks emanating from the institution. A recently leaked memorandum by the board deputy chairperson Mamodupi Mohlala was apparently leaked before it was discussed by the board of directors. The document advocates for a Commission of Inquiry into various allegations, mainly related to labour practices within the institution. It also recommends that the Group CEO be put on compulsory leave to prevent him from interfering with witnesses. Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini has denied that there is conflict between the public broadcaster’s executives and non-executives in the board. The Board believes that the leaking of the memorandum is highly prejudicial to the GCEO Madoda Mxakwe and CFO Yolande van Biljon as it contains allegations that have not been tested. Makhathini has also condemned the leak, saying that it looks like it is part of a fight-back strategy. “Of course, we will investigate these leaks because they are a problem for us and they worry us. Because it ends up overshadowing the great work that we have been doing. But we understand that there is a clear fight back strategy by those who are being held to account. A lot has gone wrong at the SABC and as we drive the renewal and rehabilitation. There are individuals who are working with certain media houses to destabilise what we are doing.”  SABC Board condemns untested allegations in leaked memorandum
