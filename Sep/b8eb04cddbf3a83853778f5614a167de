National head of investigation in the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) Matthews Sesoko, says the suspension on former Hawks head Anwa Dramat in 2014 was a shock for them since their report did not recommend such a move.   Sesoko is testifying at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg about the investigation into the rendition of five Zimbabweans between November 2010 and January 2011.   The case was seen as a political ploy to remove Dramat and his Gauteng Commander Shadrack Sibiya. The two were later exonerated of any wrongdoing. Sesoko says he doesn’t know where former police minister Nathi Ntleko got the report that recommended the suspension.   “That’s when now the conflict between the Executive Director and the Minister started. In January, we were confronted with this other report which Mr Khubo had signed. The report was sent to Advocate Musin from what Mr Khubo told us. As far as we are concerned, the only report that went to the minister is the report where we exonerated General Dramat and General Sibiya. We don’t know how the minister would’ve got this report,” explains Sesoko. Watch video below:
