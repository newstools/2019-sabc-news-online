President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for an end to hostilities between some South Africans and foreign nationals. Foreign-owned shops were targeted and looted -while some were hounded out of their shops. Five people have died in the violence – while about a hundred have been arrested. Ramaphosa said the World Economic Forum starting on Wednesday in Cape Town should be used as a platform to showcase the true nature of South Africa. Watch video below:  Meanwhile a Nigerian journalist at the United Nations, Harrison Arubu, has raised the issues of attacks against foreigners in South Africa with the Secretary General’s spokesperson in New York. “Is the Secretary General aware, and if yes, what does he have to say about the renewed wave of xenophobic attacks against foreigners in South Africa. The government has refused to recognise these attacks as xenophobic and the security agencies too, appear to be doing little or nothing to prevent these attacks.” UN Spokesperson for Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric  says: “As we said yesterday, the Secretary General condemns the acts of violence, we have seen in different provinces of SA, including attacks against foreigners, destruction against property, business owned by foreigners.” “It is very important that all political leaders clearly and openly reject the use of violence, we will note as we said yesterday President Ramaphosa’s unequivocal condemnation of the violence and his call for strengthened accountability of those who perpetrated the violence. “
