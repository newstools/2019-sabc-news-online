The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has denied claims that it is shielding some of its employees from court action. A Sunday newspaper has been reporting that Economics Editor Thandeka Qubule-Mbeki and Provincial General Manager Mamontha Motaung have been shielded from the current court action involving 28 employees. In that case the SABC wants the Labour Court to declare their appointments unlawful. The newspaper reports that more than 100 employees have been identified as having been appointed illegally. The newspaper says eyebrows were raised when the two managers were excluded from the court action. SABC Spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu whose appointment was also flagged by the newspaper, says the accusations are unfounded. “The SABC has noted the article, ‘Broadcaster Shielding Tainted Staff’, published in Sunday World. It has also noted the alleged ‘internal forensic report’ quoted in the article, of alleged irregular appointments within the organisation. The SABC is on record as having disassociated itself with such a faceless list and does not know of its origins.”
