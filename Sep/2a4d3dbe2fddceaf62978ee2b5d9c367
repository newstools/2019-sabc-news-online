Comic Con Africa is on its last day, and fans young and old have taken advantage of the opportunity to be creative in Cosplay, live-action role-playing and delving into a world of fiction. Since the weekend, over 50 000 people have immersed themselves in DC Comics, Marvel, anime, sci-fi and the new addition of Kids Con. SABC News spoke to Hollywood Star, William Shatner in an exclusive interview – at Gallagher Estate in Midrand – the 88-year old Star Trek legend described his use of time management to be successful. “That’s the way, passion. How do I find time for the projects? There are 24-hours in a day, subtract 4 hours for sleep. Subtract half an hour for working out. You got to eat, so I spend 7-8 minutes eating times 3, that’s 21-minutes. You can do a lot in those hours.”
