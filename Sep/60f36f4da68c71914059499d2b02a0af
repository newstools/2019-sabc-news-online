Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says in the absence of proof of alleged corruption by judge, he has to believe his colleagues’ denials. Justice Mogoeng has challenged those using social media to make claims of corruption in the judiciary to provide proof and reveal themselves. The claims were made by anonymous profiles on social media. They mention a list of judges, who are alleged to have received cash from the Cyril Ramaphosa 2017 presidential campaign. The Chief Justice was addressing journalists in Midrand, Johannesburg. “Make your true identity and contact details known to us and the South African public; 2. Tell us which Judge has been captured or corrupted and by whom; 3. If money or benefit was given, how much, when, and produce the verifiable documentary or electronic proof; and 4. For the sake of the South African public that deserve a corruption-free Judiciary, be prepared to give evidence even in a court of law or Commission of Inquiry.” However, in an unexpected twist, a businessman from Limpopo, Motsile Rahube, made fresh allegations at the media conference hosted by Justice Mogoeng.
