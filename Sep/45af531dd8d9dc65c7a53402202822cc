The Nigerian High Commissioner to South Africa said the country is willing to repatriate more of its people after a wave of violence against foreigners in South Africa. Nigeria announced that it endorsed the repatriation of more than 600 Nigerians back home – who will leave on flights Thursday and Friday. Nigerian High Commissioner Ambassador Kabiru Bala said the Air Peace Airline volunteered to assist with repatriations. Bala said, “If a Nigerian feels he is not secure and feels he wants to go back home, he is free to approach the consulate and the high commission in Pretoria and Johannesburg. We are planning this for tomorrow and the 13th of this month. We so far have 640 and if we had more we would put even more flights…” This is a private initiative – a company called Air Peace decided to put their planes for Nigerians to go back home and the Nigerian government endorsed it.
