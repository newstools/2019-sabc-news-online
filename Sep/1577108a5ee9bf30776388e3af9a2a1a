Former Crime Intelligence official Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo will testify at the State Capture Commission on Friday morning via an audio link from a secret location. Naidoo is currently in witness protection, following an affidavit he wrote, exposing corruption and looting in Crime Intelligence during Richard Mdluli‘s tenure. Last week, Hawks Senior Investigator, Kobus Roelofse told the commission that his investigation of Mdluli, which was based on information from Naidoo, was frustrated by senior officials from the South African Police Service and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). It is understood that 45 people, including the then Police Commissioner and now Police Minister Bheki Cele will be implicated in Naidoo’s evidence. Commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo on Thursday prohibited the broadcasting of visuals of Naidoo’s testimony. “He will give his evidence from the protected witness location 1.4. No cameras will be permitted at the protected witness location 1.5. An audio link from the protected witness location will be provided so that his evidence can be heard in the hearing room when he gives it.” Meanwhile, earlier head of the  Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) in Limpopo, Innocent Khuba, said the investigation into the rendition of Zimbabweans was aimed at getting rid of former Hawks head, Anwa Dramat. Khuba told the Inquiry into State Capture that in 2014 Berning Ntlemeza told him about the dismissal of Dramat, which later came true. He further said he struggled to find evidence that implicated Dramat in the 2010 rendition investigation. Watch the video for more on the story:
