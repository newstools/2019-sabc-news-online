Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board chair, Ben Ngubane, has denied changing the COO job advertisement to suit the qualifications – or lack thereof – of former C OO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Ngubane was testifying at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg about his tenure as the SABC board chair, during which time, former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela made damning findings in her 2014, “When Governance and Ethics fail” report. Ngubane says he only suggested the use of an old advertisement. “Chairperson, when we were talking about hiring a search company, just general discussion, I think it was in the governance committee, my view was the SABC had already appointed a COO who was then frustrated by cabinet or the minister… Mr Mbembe….yes, why don’t we just take that advert and use it, that was my only comment about this.” For more watch video below:
