The State has told the Wynberg Magistrates Court in Cape Town that a 42-year-old man has confessed to murdering 19-year-old University of Cape Town (UCT) student, Uyinene Mrwetyana. Mrwetyana’s body was found in Lingelethu West in Khayelitsha last Monday after she’d gone missing for more than a week. Spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Western Cape, Eric Ntabazalila, says blood was found on the shoes and the car of the 42-year-old accused. He cannot be named as ordered by the court, and faces charges of murder, rape and defeating the ends of justice. During court proceedings, the State informed the court that he confessed to the murder, and showed police where he hid her body. He also has a previous conviction of robbery. The matter has been postponed until the 5th of November.
