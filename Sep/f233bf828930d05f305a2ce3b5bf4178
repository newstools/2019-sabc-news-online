The African National Congress Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to establish special courts that will deal with cases of gender-based violence and rape. The League held a march in Durban, demanding an end to the killing and abuse of women and children. Addressing hundreds of marchers, the League’s provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo says they want law enforcement agencies to make gender-based violence cases their priority. “We want special courts to be created simply to deal with matters of GBV and rape and the killing of women and children across the country so that these matters can get finalised. We want the law to make it clear that all these cases must be finalised within a matter of three months because most of the time the evidence is there during the trial.”
