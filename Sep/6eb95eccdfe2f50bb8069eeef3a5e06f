Men from the Eastern Cape want programs on the prevention of violence against women and children to be discussed at all social gatherings. A group of men from various sectors, including the religious fraternity, held a peaceful march in King William’s Town, denouncing attacks on women and children. Mcebisi Dama, an ex-convict who spent seven years in jail for murdering his fiancee, also took part in the march. “I regret and I am remorseful, that is why I wrote a book “My True Confessions”. In it I am just explaining my mistakes and how I am sorry for what I did. Men should learn to respect women, to give them freedom to live the way they want to live.” Eastern Cape Premier, Oscar Mabuyane, says his government and a number of NGOs have joined the fight against women and children abuse. “Every Friday, we have actually set aside an hour in our work places, municipalities and departments where we make these demonstrations to indicate that we are against this problem of women abuse, this femicide and gender based violence, we are going to deal with this scourge, we are going to confront it.”
