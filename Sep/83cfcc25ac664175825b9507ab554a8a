President Cyril Ramaphosa officially launched the first pilot site of the district-based coordination model dubbed “Khawuleza” at a Presidential Imbizo in OR Tambo District Municipality in the Eastern Cape Province on Tuesday. The aim of the model is to drastically improve service delivery at the district level by creating alignment and synergy between the various developmental plans across the three spheres of government. In other words, local, provincial and national government will outline a five year consolidated plan for the OR Tambo District. “The occasion will also provide opportunity for the community to engage government, as a whole, on societal challenges and further opportunities for development and partnership,” according to the Presidency’s statement.
