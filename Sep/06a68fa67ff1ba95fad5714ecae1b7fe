British Royal couple, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expected to meet with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his wife Leah in Cape Town on Wednesday morning. The meeting will take place at the historic Granary, which was built by slaves more than 200 years ago. The restored building serves as the office of the Tutu Foundation. They last met in November 2015 when Prince Harry awarded the Arch with a special honour. The Queen had named him as an honorary member of The Order of the Companions of Honour in recognition of his services to United Kingdom Communities as well as International Peace and Reconciliation.
