Tourism is a key driver of the economy and contributes to job creation but some towns are battling to maintain tourism infrastructure and some tourist areas are affected by a surge in crime. One such place is the popular Howick Falls in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Parliament’s portfolio committee visited the area this week following complaints of crime and neglect. Howick Falls  is known as KwaNogqaza, the Place of the Tall One, which is a 95-metre tall waterfall. It’s a popular scenic stop-over for tourists to the KwaZulu Natal Midlands but locals say it has lost some of its shine. Crime has increased and vagrants have occupied derelict buildings. “Squatters have moved into the conservancy area. They’ve actually put up shacks. Squatters have also built shacks on top of the Howick Falls and they string their washing across there and they throw their litter into the river and it goes down into the fall and collects into the pool. Other tourists and people who have been walking in the Gorge have been mugged so it’s not safe for people to go there anymore,” says resident, Carol Mcdougal. Business owners and residents say visitors are avoiding the falls completely, opting to visit a nearby shopping centre instead. Watch video below:
