The City of Cape Town has closed three MyCiTi bus stations in Joe Slovo and Du Noon as a precautionary measure due to stone throwing and violence. Several roads in the area remain closed and Sanddrift, Potsdam and Killarney bus stations are also closed. Police have arrested one person in Du Noon for malicious damage to property. The Mayoral committee member for Transport, Felicity Purchase, says there is no justification for the vandalism and anger aimed at innocent residents, commuters, and city staff. ” We will do a final assessment after we have stability on the total cost of damages. Then we will need to decide where to prioritise whether to repair this and where to take the money from because its not a bottomless pit. All the damage that needs to be repaired needs to come out of some other budget and people need to understand this.” Meanwhile, on Friday, a truck and the Phoenix MyCiti Station were set alight. This  was in protest at the City’s clampdown on traffic offences and illegal taxi operators. Two arrests were made for public violence.
