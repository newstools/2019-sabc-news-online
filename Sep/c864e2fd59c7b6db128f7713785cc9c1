Various municipal unions, residents, non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) and political parties at Hartswater in the Northern Cape, have questioned the implementation of Section 139 at Phokwane Municipality during the National Council Of Province’s (NCOP) oversight visit. NCOP’s select committee of Cooperative Governance met with various organisations to get their views on whether the intervention of the provincial government was necessary to place the embattled Northern Cape municipality under administration. Committee Chairperson China Dodovu describes the interaction as an emotive meeting that is a clear indication that there is a crisis at Phokwane Municipality. “The municipality is going down. We need to ensure that we help the municipality to solve the problem and be the municipality that achieves its objectives. We’re going to take the presentation and submission of the Department… why the municipality was put under administration. We’re going to assess the work of the administrator, but importantly, we’re going to consider all these submissions, from political parties, the union, the community and everybody else who gave us information about the situation. We’re going to decide whether we agree with the province, or we don’t agree with the province or we don’t agree.”
