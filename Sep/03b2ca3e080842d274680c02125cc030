ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule warned that as the party seeks to implement its resolutions, which include the nationalisation of the South African Reserve Bank, the country will continue to be under attack by the enemy. He told students at Wits University that, in every revolution, thereâ€™s a counter revolution that will derail the progress in South Africa. Wits University is currently holding SRC Elections. Magashule told students to be careful of the people who claim to be part of the struggle, yet they seek to undermine the efforts of those who fought for the liberation of this country. He says the students must make sure that economic freedom is realised by the next generation of the country. Responding to the concerns that the ANC has old leaders and less youth, who should be participating in decision making within the party, Magashule says the youth must be infused with the older generation.
