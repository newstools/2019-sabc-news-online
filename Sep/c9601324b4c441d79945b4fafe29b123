British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s brother, Jo, on Thursday resigned as junior minister and said he would step down as a lawmaker, citing a conflict between family loyalty and the national interest. “It’s been an honour to represent Orpington for 9 years & to serve as a minister under three PMs,” Jo Johnson said. “In recent weeks I’ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest – it’s an unresolvable tension & time for others to take on my roles as MP & Minister,” he said.
