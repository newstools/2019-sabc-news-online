Several makeshift shacks and a scrapyard have been set alight by angry protesters in Marabastad, Pretoria. It is alleged that the incident is part of the taxi operators campaign to rid Pretoria CBD of drugs and drug dealers. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. Several people were injured including one metro police officer. Tshwane metro police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says a number of protesters have been arrested. He says police will be deployed in the area overnight. “We can confirm that people were injured, including one of our metro police cop is also injured. We are appealing for calm as the City and police. I will deploy our Metro police officers to restore order, and the citizens that are doing business around the city, the people that are supposed to work, the kids that are supposed to go to school, they should not yet panic. We continue to be here, and it’s our duty as police to serve and protect them.” Watch for more:
