Clinical Psychologist, Gerald Williamson, has urged society to explore the various, effective ways to discipline children – other than the use of corporal punishment. This follows yesterday’s Constitutional Court ruling, that corporal punishment is now illegal in South African homes. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng upheld a 2017 High Court Ruling, which declares illegal – any form of corporal punishment including smacking, spanking or physical grabbing while disciplining children. Social media users are divided over the judgement – with some saying they choose not to spare the rod. But, Williamson says there is a lack of knowledge in society over non-abusive ways to discipline children. “There are many who are literally killing their children and abusing them. I often talk about how much learning we as a society here and around the world, need to do. What we have learned, we do. So, we have learned there was corporal punishment and physical abuse, which helps us gain some control over a child. But what we haven’t learned is all the hundreds of ways that one can work with their child and still achieve desirable outcomes. So, there is a lack of knowledge.” Click related video below:
