National Deputy Police Commissioner, General Bonang Mgwenya says drastic action will be taken against members implicated in criminal activities. On Friday, former senior Hawks investigator Kobus Roelofse told Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that the crime intelligence slush fund benefited top officials and their families. Mgwenya was speaking at the provincial commemorative event in Potchefstroom, in honour of police officers who lost their lives while fighting crime. “I must say we are observing and listening to the allegations that are made at the Zondo Commission. Should it be necessary that investigations should be conducted, there will be pronouncement at the right time and at the right levels as well. After having realised that we do have challenges, I will particularly talk about allegations of corruption within the police organisation. Once they commit corruption they will be investigated.” The commission is expected to continue on Monday. Click below to watch former senior Hawks investigator Kobus Roelofse’s testimony:
