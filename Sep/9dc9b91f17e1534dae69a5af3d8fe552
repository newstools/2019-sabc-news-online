The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)  board has reaffirmed its support and respect for the SABC’s Executive Directors. This follows reports that the SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe, the CFO Yolande van Biljon and outgoing COO Craig van Rooyen have threatened to quit over alleged meddling by certain SABC Board members. In a statement issued the SABC Board says it would not be drawn into discussing internal board members and alleged differences between board members.  The board also denied reports that there’s disagreement amongst board directors about meeting the pre-conditions set by government for providing a bailout. The Board says it has written to the Ministers of Finance and of Communications, respectfully disagreeing with the view that the public broadcaster has failed to meet all the requirements for the requested R3.2 billion bailout. The Board says in a statement that it believes the ministers have not been fully briefed on the information provided by the public broadcaster. The Board says it believes the SABC has either complied or substantially complied with each precondition for the financial assistance. The board says it has provided substantial information to both ministries in this regard over the last eight months and has now requested urgent engagements with the two ministers. On Wednesday the SABC told parliament that it is still in negotiations with the National Treasury over an urgent financial injection.  SABC executives told MPs that the SABC was now at risk of failing to comply with relevant legislation.
