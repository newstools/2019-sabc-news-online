Former Crime Intelligence official, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo, has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, that he met Tiso Blackstar’s associate editor, Ranjeni Munusamy, three times to arrange for her car to be fixed. Naidoo says her vehicle settlement payments came from the Crime Intelligence secret service account. He blew the whistle in the alleged looting of millions of rands meant for intelligence work, to purchase luxury vehicles for the unit’s former head Richard Mdluli and paying for overseas holiday trips for senior officials. Naidoo who is under a witness protection programme, is testifying through an audio link from a secret location. “I subsequently picked up the vehicle and handed it back to Munusamy, it was probably a week or two later that I got a call from commissioner Mphego, he inquired why I did not put run flat tyres on that specific vehicle referring to Munusamy’s vehicle.” “I made arrangements again to pick up the vehicle from Munusamy to give back to New World motors I had those specific tyres fitted on in a silver BMW convertible.” Click video below:
