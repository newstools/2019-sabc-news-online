Former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will be buried at the National Heroes Acre monument in Harare on Sunday, family spokesperson Leo Mugabe said, rowing back from comments the family made earlier. “I can confirm that he will be buried at the National Heroes Acre on Sunday,” Leo Mugabe said, adding that the Mugabe family had held further consultations with government since it said on Thursday that Zimbabwe’s founder would be buried privately.
