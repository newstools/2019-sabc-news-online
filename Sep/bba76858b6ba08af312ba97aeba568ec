South African Communist Party general secretary Blade Nzimande, says President Cyril Ramaphosa should not be the only one apologising for the violence that has been gripping the country over the past weeks. Ramaphosa was booed by the mourners who were attending the funeral for former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Ramaphosa apologised to Zimbabweans and their families who were injured and killed in the violent protests in Johannesburg and Pretoria. Nzimande says African leaders should also apologise. “My perspective is that the President should not be the only apologising, some of our neighbouring countries they too should apologise because if you look, some of these countries are experiencing tough economic situation based on the mistakes committed by their governments or presidents.” Related video click below:
