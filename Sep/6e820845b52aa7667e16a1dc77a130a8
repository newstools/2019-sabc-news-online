The former chairperson of the SABC Commission of Inquiry into Editorial Interference, Joe Thloloe, is scheduled to testify at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg. Dr Fhatuwani Mutuvhi, who’s been the chief director of digital migration at the Communications Department is also expected to testify. Thloloe chaired the SABC Commission into Political Interference that released its findings last month. It found evidence of political interference and abuse of news staff at the public broadcaster. Thloloe’s report described the SABC as an organisation crippled by pain, anger, and fear which suffered from the capricious use of authority and power to terrorise staff and to deflect the corporation from its mandate. It however did not find evidence of a direct line between the decisions of the ANC and those decisions in the public broadcasters’ newsroom. The report has however come under fire  with the so-called SABC 8 on Thursday slating its disclosure of whistle-blowers.
