An Ekurhuleni Metro Police Officer who was allegedly found drunk in full uniform has been suspended with immediate effect. A video of the officer, taken at a parking lot of an unspecified shopping mall, shows the officer in full uniform staggering next to an EMPD branded vehicle on Tuesday. The video has gone viral on social media. His colleagues can be seen taking away the officer’s firearm and someone can be heard in the video commenting that there’s alcohol inside the police vehicle. The Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department says two other officers have also been suspended for defeating the ends of justice and dereliction of duty by assisting the officer to escape from the scene without being processed.
