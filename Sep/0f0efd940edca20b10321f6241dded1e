The SA Weather Service has issued an advisory of heavy rain, strong winds and stormy conditions from Saturday night in the Bitou region in the Southern Cape. It could lead to localised flooding along the coast and adjacent interior west of St Francis.   The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has also urged public caution along the Southern Cape coastline ahead of the cold front which is expected to grip the area into Sunday.
