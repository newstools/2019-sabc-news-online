The African National Congress (ANC) flag will be raised outside the home of the late Gavin Watson from Monday until his funeral in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. The 71-year-old businessman and former anti-apartheid activist died in a crash in Gauteng last week. The ANC’s Nelson Mandela Bay Regional Task Team co-ordinator, Luyolo Nqakula, says the party will also make its first official visit to the family since Watson’s passing. Nqakula says hoisting the flat is part of the ANC culture to commemorate a fallen hero. “The mantra is that anyone, for instance any comrade or member of the ANC who maybe in that vicinity, who may not know of the passing of comrade Gavin, once the flag is hoisted outside that particular house, he will know that a soldier has fallen, a comrade has fallen,” says Nqakula.
