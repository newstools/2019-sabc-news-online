The Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (DEMAWUSA) has distanced its members from any acts of intimidation against non-striking Metrobus workers.  The City of Johannesburg bus company says one of its buses was hijacked on Monday morning. The company says whilst it does not blame this on DEMAWUSA, it, however, cannot de-link the action from those that did not report for work. The bus was travelling from Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg to Ghandi Square in the CBD to pick up passengers when it was hijacked. DEMAWUSA’s Deon Makhura says, “Last week, there was one of our drivers who was hijacked by the taxi people, accused of loading the taxi passengers.  We need evidence, they must come with that person and clarify whether that person is our member or not. We are distancing ourselves; it might be an issue of criminality or whatever.”
