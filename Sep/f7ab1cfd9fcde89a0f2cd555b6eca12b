The South African Revenue Service says it will initiate a process of reviewing its policies on gender based violence – in solidarity with women in the country. The call was made by SARS Commissioner, Edward Kieswetter. In a statement Kieswetter writes to SARS staff saying SARS is a microcosm of society and is also accountable to society. Head of Communications in SARS, Siphithi Sibeko says:”We will choose a day next week where we will open an hour late, just as a demonstration of solidarity with our women colleagues and counterparts.” “We would look at all our practices and our policies to see whether or not we could make the necessary adjustments and adaptation of those policies to conform to a more egalitarian society that takes care and deals with discrimination against women.” Related video click below:
