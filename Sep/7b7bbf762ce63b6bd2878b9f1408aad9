Co-operative Governance Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, says Bavelile Hlongwa died as she had lived, serving the people of South Africa. The Deputy Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy died in a vehicle crash on Friday night. It’s believed that Hlongwa and her security detail had stopped to assist the occupants of another vehicle that had overturned near the Carousel Plaza in Hammanskraal, when a truck crashed into them. Dlamini-Zuma describes the evening with Hlongwa at an event at the University of Limpopo. “She was very happy, talking, taking photos and she was just her happy self it was very difficult to process and to reconcile the two. She has passed on and we had just parted on a very happy note. But of course we have to realise that everybody has their race to run. Sometimes you wonder why this person? She’s young, very active. But clearly she has to fulfil because her years are not as long as our years,” says Dalmini-Zuma. Dlamini-Zuma says Hlongwa was one of the young ANC leaders who senior members of the party wanted to groom for the future. “She was a dependable comrade, reliable and a very frank comrade. She would tell you exactly what she thinks, very firm in her views. If you don’t agree with her you must have very good arguments to try and convince her otherwise,” says Dlamini-Zuma.
