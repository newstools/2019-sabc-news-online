The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) in the North West says it has introduced a new electronic system that verifies the rightful beneficiaries for social grants. The system was introduced after the province detected fraudulent activities in the payment of grants. Over 300 clients from over 1.1 million beneficiaries were affected. SASSA General Manager Fanie Setshoga says, “We actually found a new kind of fraud that we started experiencing a lot this year, where people will come with account numbers, saying I am Lucas, here are my accounts, only to find out that the account details does not even belong to you. To avert that, electronic verification mechanism has been introduced which enables SASSA to do back office verification through the relevant agencies.”
