The Minister of Justice, Ronald Lamola, says the Special Investigation Tribunal will begin its work to recover billions of rand looted from the State, next Tuesday. Lamola says the money expected to be recovered currently stands at R14.7 billion. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the appointment of the Tribunal in February during his State of the Nation Address. The Tribunal will be chaired by Judge Gidfonia Makhanya and seven other judges will form the rest of the team. In a statement, the Department of Justice says the tribunal has a statutory mandate to recover public funds that were lost through corruption, fraud and illicit money flows.
