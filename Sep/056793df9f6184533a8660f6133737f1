Transnet has posted a nearly 25% increase in profit for the year ending on 31 March. At its results presentation in Johannesburg on Monday, the locomotives firm says the rise in profits was due to cost containment measures. The group also reported report a 1.6% rise in annual revenue, but irregular expenditure increased from R8 billion to R49 billion in the same period. Acting Chief Executive Officer, Mohammed Mohamedy is, however, querying the irregular expenditure figure with the auditors. He says the controversial locomotive tender is included in the reporting period, which accounts for the figure ballooning to R49bn from R8bn. The audit opinion sparked an argument with external auditors Sizwe Ntsaluba Gobodo over pre-qualifying conditions imposed by Transnet on the suppliers of locomotives.
