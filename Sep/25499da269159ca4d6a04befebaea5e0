The KwaZulu-Natal government and business leaders from Pietermaritzburg have formed a partnership aimed at improving service delivery in the province’s capital city. Captains of industry and the province’s leadership met in Pietermaritzburg to see how to strategically position the city in order to increase economic activity. This after the uMsunduzi Municipality in the city was placed under administration amid poor service delivery. Premier Sihle Zikalala says the structure being formed will meet regularly to address concerns in the city. Zikalala says, “Business and the government will collaborate at a level of the municipality and the local business chamber of Pietermaritzburg. That will help us to address issues of concern and focus on a strategy to grow the economy of the city, but also to develop the surrounding areas.” “We believe that this will put together and build trust between the new exco, the new Mayor as well as the business leadership. We have put together a structure now that will meet monthly to deal with all issues that need to be pursued,” added Zikalala.
