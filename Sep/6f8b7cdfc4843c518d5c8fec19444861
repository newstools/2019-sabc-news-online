Save the Children South Africa has described as appalling and saddening, the recent killing of four children in Wybank, west of Durban. A 44-year-old man, accused of killing the four siblings, has been arrested. Three of the children were found hanging in their home while the fourth was strangled to death in New Germany.  The three youngest victims were the man’s biological children, while the 17-year-old was his stepchild. He allegedly killed the children following an argument with their mother. Save the Children SA’s Sibusiso Khasa says they welcome the police’s swift action in arresting the suspect. “As Save the Children South Africa we are appalled and saddened by the reports of the killing of the children. We also welcome the arrest made by the police because it indicates that some action has taken place. We do acknowledge that the suspect is innocent until proven guilty but we hope that this arrest will lead to conviction,” adds Khasa.
