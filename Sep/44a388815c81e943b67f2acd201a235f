Land Reform and Rural Development minister, Thoko Didiza is expected to deliver the keynote address at District Six Heritage Festival in Cape Town on Tuesday. The festival which forms part of the Heritage Day celebrations will also see the official renaming of the Keizergracht to Hanover Street. About 60 000 residents of District Six were forcefully removed from the area during apartheid under the Group Areas Act of 1950. They were moved to the Cape Flats. Didiza will be joined by among others, Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato. They will lead a march procession from the Grand Parade to District Six.
