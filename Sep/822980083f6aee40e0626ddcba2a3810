Minister for Women Children and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane has declared Sunday the eighth of September as a day of prayer and a moment of silence – in honour of women and children killed in the country. Minister Nkoana-Mashabane and her Justice and Constitutional Development counterpart Ronald Lamola as well as Deputy Social Development Minister Henrietta Bogopane Zulu were addressing the media in Cape Town on recent incidents of gender-based violence and femicide. She said the attacks on women represented a lack of respect and failure to recognise the inherent equality and dignity of women. “The department is declaring Sunday as a day of just reflecting. We can do it in whatever form, Interdenominational. Those who go to whichever form of religious belief, they should go and get together and make sure that this indeed comes to an end,” says Nkoana-Mashabane. Watch related video below
