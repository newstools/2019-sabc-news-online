Former Crime Intelligence official, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo has told the State Capture Commission that his ex boss, Richard Mdluli used the unit’s safe houses for personal use. Naidoo, who is in a witness protection programme, is testifying via an audio link from a secret location. He blew the whistle on the alleged looting of millions from a secret services account that was meant for intelligence work. The money was allegedly used to purchase luxury vehicles for Mdluli and pay for overseas holiday trips for senior officials. Naidoo says he did very little of his work, because he became a lacky for Mdluli and Crime Intelligence’s head of financial services, Solomon Lazarus. “General Mdluli at the time made use of a safe house. I had to make sure that the safe house was stocked with groceries when he was there. He also had a vehicle there, I had to make sure it was cleaned all the time whenever he used it. Also initially for purchasing flight tickets for him this is for General Mdluli so these things took up my time,  so most of the time I was hardly at the office doing the job I was supposed to be doing.”
