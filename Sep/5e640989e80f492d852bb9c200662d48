The Western Cape Human Settlements Department has handed over more than 440 houses and 200 title deeds this month. Houses were handed over in Eerste River, Kuils River, Cape Agulhas and Theewaterskloof. Title deeds were handed over in Delft, Caledon, Tesselaarsdal and Ebenhaeser in the Matzikama Municipality. Provincial Minister, Tertuis Simmers, says this is a clear indication of the provincial government’s commitment to accelerate the delivery of housing. He says: “I am pleased with the pace at which we are moving these handovers. This clearly shows that we are not playing lip service in our aim to improve the lives of our people.” “Our strategy is clear and we are effectively executing it. It is through processes such as these that the dignity of our people is restored,” says Simmers.
