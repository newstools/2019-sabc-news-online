The Chris Hani District and Sakhisizwe local municipalities are to provide food and temporary shelter to the more than 250 residents who were affected by Sunday’s severe storm at Cala in the Eastern Cape. Five people, including a two year-old toddler, died after walls of their homes collapsed. Power lines and roofs were also blown away. Chris Hani executive mayor, Wongama Gela, says they expect the assessment of the damage to be completed by Tuesday. “The preliminary assessment done indicates that there are 250 individuals who are in need of food tonight. But also there are a number of families who have offered to take some of them to accommodate them tonight and then we’ll check which families are going to be accommodated and which are those who are not going to be accommodated so that the municipality will then provide accommodation for those. That is the temporary measure for today.”
