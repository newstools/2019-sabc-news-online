From controversial archive material to the controversial News breakfast briefing on the SABC’s platform,  the State capture Commission zooms into how the controversial Gupta family diverted funds from the public broadcaster. The commission is expected to hear testimony from the SABC top brass and as well some of the SABC 8. The political machinations at the SABC and its influence on editorial decisions will also come under scrutiny. Among those expected to take the stand are SABC GCEO Madoda Mxwakwe, News Head Phathiswa Magopeni and one of the SABC 8, Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki. Among the names expected to come up is that of embattled former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Former ann7 editor, Rajesh Sundaram earlier told the commission of evidence that points to how valuable assets from the SABC’s archive had been sold to the Guptas for a pittance. SUNDARAM  detailed how ANN7 secured SABC material through the friendship of the Guptas with former President Jacob Zuma. However, the SABC man who facilitated the deal refutes these claims, claiming that there was nothing untoward about the deal. The deal transpired because of the former  SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s instruction. Another of the dealings includes the controversial TNA breakfast show, where the Gupta-owned company,The New Age, swindled the SABC out of R20 million. Now the State capture Commission wants answers on how far the Gupta tentacles stretched at the public broadcaster. Click video below:
