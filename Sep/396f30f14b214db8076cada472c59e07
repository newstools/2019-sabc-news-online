The Passenger Rail Agency says it will embark on a series of cash recovery measures after the High Court in Johannesburg’s judgement against Daniel Mthimkhulu who had labelled himself a “Doctor” when his highest qualification was matric. The court ordered Mthimkhulu to repay R5.7-million he had earned as a senior manager. PRASA says Mthimkhulu also played a central role in the dodgy Swifambo contract and judgements in this regard also clear the way for the rail agency to recover more than R2.6-billion. PRASA says it will continue in its efforts to root out corruption at the agency.
