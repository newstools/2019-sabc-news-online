The Communications and Digital Transformation Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has instructed the Post Office board to conduct a thorough investigation into the conduct of the killer of Uyinene Mrwetyana. A 43-year-old Post Office employee has confessed to the murder of the University of Cape Town (UCT) student. Ndabeni-Abrahams was among the ministers that had accompanied President Cyril Ramaphosa to Mrwetyana’s family home in East London. She says that she is pleased to see that there is progress in the investigation. “Well as the department responsible for postal services in this country, we are saddened by what happened. That is why the minister called for an investigation and we are pleased to say there is progress in the investigation. The board sat and have given us some recommendations. We are waiting for them to finalise that as they’ve established a special committee into looking into the matter. “And definitely we are committed to one thing; that a harsh action has to be taken both by government and of course we hope that the judiciary, without undermining its own processes, will act harshly. It’s high time we shouldn’t be thinking about protecting people who kill women,” Ndabeni-Abrahams laments.
