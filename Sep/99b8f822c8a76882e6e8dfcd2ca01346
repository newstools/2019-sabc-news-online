Dozens of African National Congress (ANC) supporters from the Sedibeng region in the Vaal have marched to the Hawks’ headquarters in Pretoria to demand a speedy investigation into allegations of corruption in their municipality. The party says the level of corruption in a number of Vaal-based municipalities which include Lesedi, Emfuleni and Midvaal, is out of control. In Emfuleni, no mayor has finished a term due to instability. In the Midvaal local municipality, which is Democratic Alliance-run, a jobs-for-cash scandal broke out there earlier this year. Jackie Seshaoka read the memorandum of demands to the Hawks. “Case number 7/11/2018, that’s for Emfuleni, 5/08/2019 that’s Lesedi local municipality. We demand conclusion of the mentioned arson cases in Emfuleni electrical department and the ANC regional office. In Midvaal we demand investigation into jobs for cash scandal. In Lesedi we demand the Hawks to investigate fraudulent pay out of insurance and illegal awarding of security tender,” says Seshaoka.
