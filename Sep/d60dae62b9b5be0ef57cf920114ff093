The families of three people whose bodies remain trapped underground at Lily Mine near Barberton in Mpumalanga, say it is difficult for them to partake in Heritage Day activities as they have yet to receive closure. In some cultural practices, families use Heritage Day to visit graves of their loved ones. Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyarenda and Yvonne Mnisi were on duty inside a lamp room container in 2016 when the mine’s surface caved in. Some family members of the three, are still camping outside the mine’s premises. “Since from that day up to this day, psychologically we are not okay that’s why we are begging our government to intervene, to help us in terms of the retrieval of the trio. We are asking for their interventions to try and assist us as the families of the trio in terms of the retrieval of the trio,” says Pretty Nkambule’s younger brother, Sfiso Mavuso.
