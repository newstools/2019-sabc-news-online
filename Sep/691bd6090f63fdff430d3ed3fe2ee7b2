National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss, Shamila Batohi says it is disturbing that 100 cases of gender-based violence are reported to the police countrywide daily. Batohi says 40% of the cases are where children are violated. She was addressing scores of public servants at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Public servants marched through the streets of the Pretoria CBD to highlight the scourge of violence on women and children. Batohi says this cannot be tolerated. “We had met with the National Commissioner of Police about two weeks ago and we put together a strategy on how collectively with our partners we can ensure that these cases … that prosecutors are dedicated, investigators are dedicated and that people who chose to commit these crimes will face full wrath of the law. We need to do this together people, and I look to all your support to ensure that we must not be here in a year or two or three years’ time still chanting this and that we must make the real difference,” says Batohi.

Minister Mchunu says male officials have no right whatsoever to make such demands. “In the workplace we must burn all forms of sexual harassment. We are saying any form of promotion at work is free. It just requires your qualification, skill and capability, finish and klaar. You do not owe anybody anything. Do not sell anything before you are promoted,” says Mchunu.
