[Warning: The following story contains graphic details which could upset sensitive people including children] The trial of Nicholas Ninow who is accused of raping a seven-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant bathroom in Silverton will start at the Pretoria High Court on Monday. Ninow faces charges of rape, kidnapping, drug possession, assault and defeating the ends of justice. He was found allegedly half dressed with the little girl in a toilet cubicle in the restaurant after she called for help. A doctor’s report indicated her private parts were swollen, bruised and torn. It is expected that the state will bring an application to allow for the little girl to testify in a closed court over CCTV with the help of a mediator to ensure she doesn’t have contact with Ninow.
