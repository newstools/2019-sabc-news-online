With some of the best game reserves, large scale mining activities and being home to the Big Five animals, North West presents itself as a destination of choice for tourists. The rich cultural heritage and two biospheres in Groot Marico and Magaliesberg, also upscale the image of the province. Strategically positioned on the border of Gauteng and North West, Hartbeespoort has some interesting tourist attractions. It is situated between Magaliesberg and Witwatersberg mountain ranges. Constructed in 1916, the dam has drawn throngs of local and international tourists to this part of the country. “It’s actually between two richest of mountains, which give a very special tranquility effect of the water and the environment that meets together here,” says Department of Water and Sanitation’s Petrus Venter. On the shores of the dam are different game farms and the zoo where different s kinds of animals are found. “Our culture is diverse, incredibly rich. We sit with platinum fields. There is a lot of farming going on in the area,” says Tourism Hartbeespoort’s Iain Gunn. Hartbeespoort also offers water activities with boat cruises and zip lining. North West has many other tourist attractions in almost all parts of the province. Sun City, Pilanesberg National Park, Molopo Game Reserve, and Madikwe Game Reserves are some of the places where game is found. Some want the provincial government to invest more in tourism and look at this sector for economic diversification from heavy reliance on mining. “The economic structure that’s depending on mines, it is high risk in my opinion, because tourism will always be there,” says one of the residents. North West also shares borders with Botswana and prides itself of being a gateway to some African countries.
