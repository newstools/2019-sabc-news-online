Experts at the fuel retailers’ association’s conference which took place at Nasrec, in the South of Johannesburg, have agreed that small-to-medium-sized enterprises still experience difficulties penetrating the fuel industry. They say there are a number of opportunities that exist in the petroleum industry including professional services, wholesale and distribution. The Chief Director at the Department of Energy’s Leketi Gosetseone says, “It is estimated that in general, from the seven oil merges, they spend about hundred million per annum on total procurement of services.” Gosetseone says,  “So these planned shut downs present  opportunities for small to medium enterprises to equip themselves with the skill for services, for cleaning for maintained…I’ve already spoken to wholesale, there’s also opportunities in distribution.” Earlier, experts said the petroleum industry continues to face a number of domestic and global challenges. The supply of fuel is the biggest issue. They say disruptions in production will affect importers of oil, like South Africa and the latest attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia will have an impact on the petrol price going forward.
