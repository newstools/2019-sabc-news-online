Two women and a man arrested in connection with the kidnapping of six-year-old Amy’Leigh de Jager are expected to apply for bail whey they appear in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court in the Vaal on Thursday morning. Amy’Leigh de Jager was kidnapped earlier this month outside the Kollegepark Primary School as she was being dropped off by her mother. She was released unharmed by her kidnappers. The accused were arrested in their homes in Vanderbijlpark on the Vaal. One of them, a female – who also a teacher at Amy’Leigh’s school – was a close friend of the child’s mother. They appeared briefly in court last week Monday and the matter was postponed to today for a bail application. They were remanded back into custody. They face a charge of kidnapping. The alleged kidnappers had initially demanded a R2 million ransom. Amy’Leigh was returned to her parents unharmed 24 hours after she went missing. Click below for related video…
