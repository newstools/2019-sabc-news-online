The Freedom Front Plus (FFP) says it is conducting an internal investigation after a video surfaced of the party’s Limpopo leader allegedly using the word K-word to refer to black people. Member of the Limpopo Legislature, Marcelle Maritz allegedly used the word in referring to the people attending her church. FF Plus National Spokesperson, Wouter Wessels says the party does not tolerate racial discrimination and action will be taken. “Firstly, the Freedom Front Plus condemns any form of racism and we have a zero-tolerance with regards to that. We are conducting internal investigations because she denies that she used that specific word as a racial slur and that she didn’t use that word, but that it’s a different Afrikaans word that sounds similar. And we can’t at this stage, beyond any doubt, say that she did use the word or did not use the word. That’s why an investigation is necessary and we say that the law must take its course and we will then act accordingly.”
