The family of Durban University of Technology (DUT) student Sandile Ndlovu, who was stabbed in the head while studying in a lecture room on campus, wants the university to release video footage of the incident. However,  DUT spokesperson Alan Khan says they do not have the footage of the actual incident which happened on Monday evening, but adds that other footage has been handed over. The circumstances of the attack remain unclear. Family spokesperson Tshepo Mokoena says they are devastated after the industrial engineering student succumbed to injuries in a Durban hospital in the early hours of Saturday. “At this point in time, we are shattered and we’re still confused on what happened. But we don’t want to focus on that for now. Unfortunately Sandile passed on this morning (Saturday) after a long fight, he fought hard. But he succumbed to his injuries, we are shattered. We had sent Sandile to school obviously to come back with an education, it was never in our mind that we’d bring Sandile home in this format.”
