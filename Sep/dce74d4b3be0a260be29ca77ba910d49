Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) says they have applied for an interdict to halt the nationwide strike by the South African Society of Bank Officials (SASBO) on Friday. Around 40 000 members are expected to take part in the strike – which is against the retrenchment of workers and digitalisation of banking systems. SASBO says the union will ensure that ATMs and banking operations are not functional. In Gauteng, it will start at Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) House down to the bank city where the memorandum will be handed over. In Durban, they will go to the city hall. The acting head of Business Unity South Africa, Cas Coovadia says a ruling on the interdict will be handed down on Wednesday. “We have applied for an interdict and we are expecting a ruling tomorrow. We applied for the interdict because the strike has been planned on the basis of a section 77 notice. That was actually done in August 2017 and our legal people are of the view that the notice is out dated. So, we have applied for an interdict and we are awaiting the ruling tomorrow,” explains Coovadia. Click below for related video….
