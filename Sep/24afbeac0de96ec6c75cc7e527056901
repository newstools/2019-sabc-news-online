The case of five-year-old Michael Komape who died after falling into a pit toilet at a school in Limpopo is heading to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein on Monday. The Grade R learner died on January 20, 2014, at Mahlodumela Primary School near Seshego outside Polokwane. The High Court in Polokwane dismissed a civil claim last year. Komape’s father, James, says five years later, the tragedy still deeply affects them. “We will only be relieved when the case is concluded and government does what it is supposed to do. Michael’s death has caused us a lot of pain and we never thought we would be having a legal battle with government. The authorities have wronged us. We will wait and see what will transpire in court, but our wish is for the court to rule in our favour,” says James.
