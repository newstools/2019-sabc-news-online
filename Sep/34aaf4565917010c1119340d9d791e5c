Gauteng’s Human Settlement and Cogta MEC Lebogang Maile has announced that housing applications in the province will soon be processed through a biometric system to eliminate corruption. Maile told the media that the process of applying and allocating houses has been fraught with corruption and maladministration and that biometric system will curb it. He also announced that they will soon be blacklisting a number of construction companies after billions worth of building projects were abandoned. Maile admits that the biometric system is long overdue. “We want to automate our housing list so that everybody who is waiting for a house must be able to know and see where they are. If we allocate a house we must be able to know you cannot get another house elsewhere,” said Maile.   Alexandra resettlement MEC Maile has also announced mass resettlement of Alexandra residents, saying government will soon be embarking on a program aimed at redesigning the township. He says this is in response to protests by Alexandra residents earlier this year over the mushrooming of illegal structures and other service delivery challenges. Maile says he will be visiting Alexandra this week to inform the residents. “We have understood the problem in Alex is overcrowding and there’s limited space it’s over populated so if you want to deal with that issue you have to be able to take people out of alex and then redevelop it bloc by bloc so it’s scientific so I don’t think people of Alex will have a problem because they want development.”
