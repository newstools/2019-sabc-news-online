Independent Police Investigative Directorate‘s (IPID) national head of investigations, Matthew Sesoko says the Public Protector’s office is being weaponised against the independent directorate. Sesoko concluded his testimony at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg. He was testifying about high profile cases such as the rendition of five Zimbabweans between November 2010 and January 2011. The case was seen as a political ploy to remove former Hawks boss Anwa Dramat and his Gauteng Commander Shadrack Sibiya. The two were later exonerated of any wrongdoing. Sesoko says he views this as a push back because they dared to investigate those who were not supposed to be investigated. “In my view, the Public Protector’s office was now being weaponised against us. There is this fight back campaign against us so that it derails all these investigations. Recently there is a report issued by the Pubic Protector that makes findings against us; we are clear that we don’t agree with those findings, we are taking them on review and interdict them.” A visibly concerned State Capture Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo bemoaned the corrupt behaviour within the law enforcement sector after Sesoko testified. Sesoko told the commission that he believes that some of the Generals in the South African Police Service are being protected from prosecution. Zondo responded as follows. “We can’t hope to clean up corruption in this country if there is a lot of corruption within law enforcement agencies, we can’t and it’s not good for the country for people to know that if you are a low ranking official you will be brought to court but if you are high ranking you will be protected from prosecution. It can’t be and if we can’t sort that out then there is no chance of sorting corruption in this country.”
