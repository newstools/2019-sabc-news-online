Police have arrested four foreign nationals on charges of kidnapping and being in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition in Manenberg on the Cape Flats. The suspects, aged between 17 and 34 allegedly kidnapped a person at Wolseley in the Boland earlier this week. Police spokesperson Andre Traut says members of their Flying Squad and K9 Unit made the arrests. Traut said, “The members spotted a white Toyota Corolla with four occupants driving without backlights on Govan Mbeki Drive, which led to the discovery of a 9mm pistol and 11 rounds of ammunition.” “Further investigation linked the suspects to a kidnapping which was perpetrated the previous evening. The victim was traced to Browns Farm where he was found unharmed. The suspects are expected to make their court appearances in Wolseley once they have been charged.”
