The National Sea Rescue Institute has urged public caution around the coastline this weekend ahead of a cold front. Storm conditions, strong winds and heavy rain have been forecast from late on Saturday into Sunday.  NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon says the spring tide will also peek on Saturday. “We encourage the public to follow the SA Weather Service forecasts and monitor their alerts and changes in weather forecasts over the next 48-hours. Strong rip currents will prevail around the coastline and we urge the public at all times to swim at beaches protected by lifeguards and swim between the lifeguard’s red and yellow flags. We strongly advise against crossing flooding rivers or swimming in rivers near to a coastal river mouth.”
