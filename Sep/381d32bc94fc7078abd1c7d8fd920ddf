Power utility Eskom says it will keep the lights on despite a very challenging winter period. Speaking to the media in Johannesburg Chairperson and CEO of Eskom Jabu Mabuza announced that they have enough coal stock and will continue to keep the lights on over the summer period. Mabuza says however, the power system will remain tight in the coming months due to increased plant maintenance. “It is important to note that summer usually comes with its own challenges. For example, the higher ambient temperature and the wind directions sometimes have a negative impact on some of our plants. The change in customer electricity consumption in summer means an all high during the day and just not the evening peak from 5pm to 9pm which presents a challenge because the demand profile is flat,” says Mabuza.
