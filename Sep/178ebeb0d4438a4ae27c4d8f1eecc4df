Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says no amount of infighting within the SABC Board should threaten the stability of the public broadcaster. Ndabeni-Abrahams was responding to questions from members of the Parliamentary Communications Committee about recent media reports of alleged infighting within the Board. Abrahams told MPs that the ministry has been made aware of some of the problems. “We received correspondence from some board members citing some challenges that they are experiencing amongst themselves. We have written to the Board Chair to inform him this is the correspondence that we have received. So, we would call the members and then call the Board Chair to say this is what the members are saying. The response that we got was that SABC is capable of dealing with their issues as the Board. We have written back in response to say we do appreciate that, but then when Board members complain about each other we also have the right to intervene, because there is a need for stability at the SABC. Whatever infighting that is there, it must then not lead to the organisation being dysfunctional. That’s very primary for us,” explains Abrahams. Watch related video below for more on the story:
