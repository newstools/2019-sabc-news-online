The long-awaited African National Congress (ANC) eThekwini regional conference will be held in two months’ time. The region is currently under the administration of a Regional Task Team that was appointed in July 2019. Some members in the region previously threatened to go to court rejecting the task team alleging that it is not reflective of all groupings in the region. Task Team Co-ordinator, Mluleki Ndobe says they have now re-configured the team to ensure that it is inclusive of all factions. “All branches have accepted the RTT and we have agreed on the programme. We are projecting to start with BGM’s mid-month of October and we have concluded the audit. We are now waiting for the results of the audit from the Secretary General’s office, so that branches can effect corrections where necessary. Then immediately after that, we continue with BGM’s where (we) would nominate delegates as well as nominate leadership of the region,” says Ndobe.
