All driving schools and other road and traffic-related businesses will be required to obtain a permit to operate in the near future. The Transport Department is currently making amendments to the Road Traffic Act which will have far-reaching implications. Addressing the media in Johannesburg earlier on Friday, the Transport Department’s Director-General, Simon Zwane, said they were exploring ways of regulating the system. “We are for instance looking at registration of all driving schools, we are looking at classifying and regulating the categories of instructors that should be there. Issuing of permits to driving schools and what they can and can’t do including the fact that citizens will have to do booking themselves; driving school is not allowed. They must do what they do which is teaching the learners.”
