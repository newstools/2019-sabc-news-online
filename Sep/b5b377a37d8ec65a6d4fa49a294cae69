The Labour Court will on Thursday morning rule whether or not the South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) can continue with its strike against retrenchments. Business Unity South Africa (Busa) filed an urgent court application to interdict the strike. Sasbo plans to hold nationwide protest action this Friday while a second strike is planned for October the 7th. Around 50 000 workers have indicated that they will protest and picket against recent retrenchments in the banking sector. Busa, Cosatu, and Sasbo are all confident Thursdayâ€™s ruling will be in their favour. Sasbo says it will appeal the judgement if the ruling does not go its way.
