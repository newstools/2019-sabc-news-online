The Democratic Alliance (DA), Congress of the People (COPE) and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) want an urgent meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa about the violent attacks on foreign nationals and their businesses in Gauteng. DA Leader Mmusi Maimane, COPE Leader Mosiua Lekota and ACDP Leader Kenneth Meshoe made the announcement on the steps of the National Assembly in Parliament on Wednesday.   Maimane says they also want Parliament to intervene in the matter. “We have written to the Presidency to request an urgent meeting with President Ramaphosa. It is time that we work out a plan that works for all South Africans, that we are able to deploy the intelligence and the intelligence report that deals with what is happening with the sporadic violence in our communities.” “Secondly, we have written to Parliament to establish a National Assembly committee. This committee will seek to engage on the previous report that was tabled on xenophobic acts, what was the remedial actions tabled in that report and why has that report not been followed through.” Click video below:
