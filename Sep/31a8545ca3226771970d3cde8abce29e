Cape Town has kicked off Arbor Month by planting 150 trees which have been donated by the Indian government in memory of civil rights campaigner, Mahatma Gandhi. The City of Cape Town says the planting of trees is also in commemoration of Gandhi’s birthday, who would have turned 150 in October. Mayoral Committee Member for Community Services and Health, Zahid Badroodien says Gandhi was also an avid activist for environmental protection. “The trees are a recognition of the partnership and the friendship that we have with the Indian government, but also a recognition of the teachings of peaceful resistance and environmental conservation that Mahatma Gandhi  has taught, as part of his teachings across, not only South Africa, but in India as well.”
