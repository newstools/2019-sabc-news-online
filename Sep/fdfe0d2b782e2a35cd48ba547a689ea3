Several roads in Africaâ€™s richest square mile, Sandton, north of Johannesburg, are closed to traffic and motorists are advised to avoid the area until Friday afternoon. The roads affected include, among others, Maude, West, Rivonia and Gwen lane.  Hundreds of people have gathered in the business district to raise awareness against gender-based violence (GBV). The protest is being led by Call to Action a consortium representing more than 70 civil society groups; they aim to bring the area to a standstill saying it cannot be business as usual while women and children are being killed daily. They are saying that big business also has a responsibility to also play its part, they have the finance to assist especially the public sector and civil organisations which need the money and the funding to help curb gender-based violence. They are saying that enough has not been done and that they have had enough. The protest action has been sparked by the killing of 19-year-old Uyinene last week.   Click on the video below:
