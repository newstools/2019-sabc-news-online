The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, will on Thursday morning hear an in camera application. The application is from former Crime Intelligence official, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo, who is in witness protection. He is there following an affidavit he wrote exposing corruption and looting in the Crime Intelligence during Richard Mdluliâ€™s tenure. On Monday, Deputy Chief Justice Ramond Zondo postponed the hearing of the application to Thursday. The Commission is also expected to continue hearing evidence from Limpopo head of the police watchdog IPID, Innocent Khuba. Last week, the commission heard from Hawks senior investigator, Kobus Roelofse, who testified that his investigation of Mdluli, which was based on information from Naidoo, was frustrated by senior officials from the SA Police Service (SAPS) and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The proceedings will resume at 11am. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
