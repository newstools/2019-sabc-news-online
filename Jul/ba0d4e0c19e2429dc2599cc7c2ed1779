The RK Khan Action Committee is calling for the dissolution of the hospital’s current board. There has been public outrage after a video went viral on social media last week, showing a patient’s mouth filled with live maggots. 52-year-old Saadick Ebrahim died just days later at the hospital in Chatsworth, the south of Durban. Residents are expected to embark on a demonstration outside the hospital on Monday afternoon. Committee member, Visvin Reddy, says the hospital has become a death trap. “The board of RK Khan was appointed last year. It was not advertised. Nobody even knew about it. We call on the MEC to immediately dissolve this board and put in place a board that is representative of the community. 40% of staff vacancies are unfilled. If you look at the patient nurse ratio it is very high,” says Reddy. Meanwhile, these RK Khan patients and visitors have expressed their frustration at the current state of affairs. “See how long we are waiting. From 6 o’ clock we are waiting. I’m so sick too and we have to wait. Sometimes they are not fair. My brother was here. He got injured at work, but they took long time to help him. After I saw what I saw it’s not too good. I’m not too happy about this hospital. They got no way (sic) of treating the people around here,” say some of the patients.
