Former Black Business Council president Danisa Baloyi and her three co-accused are expected back in court on Wednesday in connection with the alleged misappropriation of a R5 million donation. Baloyi, Dominic Ntsele and siblings Bibi Hawa and Abubaker Khan were arrested in May on fraud and theft charges after they redirected a donation by Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) to another company. According to the Hawks, in 2017 Baloyi approached Acsa for a fundraising donation of R5 million to support the council’s economic transformation lobbying programme. Baloyi allegedly submitted Merit Energy PTY Limited, owned by siblings Bibi Hawa Khan and Abubaker Ebrahim, and its banking details as the company alleged to have been nominated to run the fundraising event. However, the funds were later transferred to Incentive Driven Marketing, which is allegedly owned by Dominic Ntsele and the funds were allegedly never used for their intended purpose. The accused earlier appeared in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court east of Johannesburg and were released on bail of R5000 each.
