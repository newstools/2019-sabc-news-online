A task team has been appointed by Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements Lebogang Maile to try and restore peace in Lenasia South following protests by home owners against land invasions. Earlier on Saturday, police fired rubber bullets as protests flared up again. The community says that government has failed to act over the mushrooming of illegal shacks – which homeowners say is negatively affecting the value of their bonded homes. Maile led a delegation to the area to meet with community leaders. The task team has been set up and they are expected to meet on Tuesday. “We know that there have been court orders for a lot of these land invaded areas to be evicted and moved which it was never ever done by the municipality. Now they hoping to put this into place. We are going to call Mayor Herman Mashaba and hopefully he will be able to come through and also address these issues.” “We will get through to him hopefully sometime, even this evening, so that they could find a way to bring about some kind of peace in Lenasia South,” says Maile.
