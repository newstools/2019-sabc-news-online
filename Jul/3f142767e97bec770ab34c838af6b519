The African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League (ANCWL) has once again called on the justice system to have no mercy for perpetrators of gender-based violence. The call follows Friday’s court appearance of a 19-year-old Welkom man who is accused of brutally killing his 21-year-old girlfriend two months ago. The alleged murderer, Obed Leshoro, is expected back in court on Thursday. He was arrested few days after the disappearance of Naledi Lethoba whose decomposing body was found with several stab wounds. Free State ANC Women’s League Chairperson, Olly Mlamleli, says courts should mete out harsh sentences on those who are found guilty of committing heinous crimes. “Our jails are full of these murderers that are enjoying life at the expense of our children. We are calling on the ANC government to give stricter sentences to make them feel,” says Mlamleli.
