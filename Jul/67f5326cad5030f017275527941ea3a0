The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has come out in support of the Office of the Public Protector, adding its voice condemning what it says is ‘attacks’ on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s investigation into President Cyril Ramaphosa has divided opinions within the ANC. The league released a statement on Friday calling on all its members and supporters to adhere to the call of the ANC leadership to respect the Office of Public Protector. Last week while addressing the Nehawu Policy Conference, SACP’s First Deputy General Secretary Solly Mapaila accused Mkhwebane of being used to fight factional battles within the ANC. In a statement released on Friday, the ANCWL says it’s disappointed with continuous attacks on the Public Protector even after President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Secretary General of ANC, Ace Magashule, respectively made calls for the Office of Public Protector to be respected. The league says it will use internal platforms within the organisation to persuade all members, in particular the National Executive Committee and Cabinet members to be exemplary and adhere to the call.
