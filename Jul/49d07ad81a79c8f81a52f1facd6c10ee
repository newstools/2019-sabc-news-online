Former South African Airways (SAA) Human Resources General Manager Thuli Mpshe will testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Monday. Last week former acting chief procurement officer at SAA Masimba Dahwa and BNP Capital Director Daniel Mahlangu finalised the testimonies. Mahlangu said he regretted the day he met Masotsha Mngadi a personal advisor of former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni and business partner. In 2017, Mahlangu signed an affidavit which distanced Mngadi from BNP Capital. However, there was evidence that Mngadi provided proposal input for an SAA tender through BNP Capital. He was also heavily involved in negotiating the deal. Mpsheâ€™s evidence is expected to shed light on how people who did not toe the line were suspended at the airline.
