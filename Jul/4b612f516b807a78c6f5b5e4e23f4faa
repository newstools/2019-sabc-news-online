The state of health care in Limpopo is deplorable and this according to the Human Rights Commission  (SAHRC) after a fact finding mission in the province. It says aging infrastructure has become a major hindrance to the delivery of quality health care service. Staffing and centralisation of procurement of medicine have been identified as some of the major challenges. The commission says this poses a grave threat to the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI) and other vital services. “In Musina for instance the shortage of stuff was very palpable many places in the hospital were dirty, just dirty in the true sense of the word and the kitchen was not clean. We then went to the CEO and we wanted to know and he told us about the staffing that when a post becomes vacant, they are not allowed to hire,” says Bongani Mojola. The provincial health department says it’s prioritising some of the issues mentioned in the commission’s report. “New hospitals are supposed to be built and that process is under way. It is at a planning stage. With regard to human resources, we currently in the process of employing grounds men and ward attendants as way of filling up those posts. We are advertising the positions of clinic operational managers, chief executive officers and clinical manager,” says Limpopo Health Department Spokesperson, Neil Shikwambana. The commission will also visit other provinces over the next months.
