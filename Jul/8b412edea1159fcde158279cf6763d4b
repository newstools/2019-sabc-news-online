Acting Mayor of the eThekwini Municipality Fawzia Peer says she stands by her claims that the bottled water she drank during the City’s Executive Committee meeting in June was spiked with paraffin. The water that Peer allegedly drank was sent for laboratory testing and earlier this week the results came back negative. Peer says she got a doctor’s report on her condition after drinking the water. “A bottle that was opened and I took a gulp of water, definitely had a paraffin smell. I’m not the only one, there were four others that smelled the paraffin and the chief whip immediately said to me spit it out but was already gone down my throat. We do have doctors report on my condition as well. Four people and even the Speaker had smelled the paraffin so that says much.”
