Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba‘s office has dismissed as cheap politicking, claims by civic organisation Sanco that he promotes land grabs across the city. On Wednesday, South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) opened a case against Mashaba at the Johannesburg central police station. Sanco says Mashaba has failed to act on illegal land occupations and that he promotes land grabs by servicing illegally occupied land. Johannesburg mayoral spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka says Sanco is just playing politics. “The office of executive Mayor and City of Johannesburg has noted the wild allegations made by Sanco against Herman Mashaba.” “The accusations are the worse kind of cheap politicking and must be dismissed with contempt.” Related video click below:
