Former President Jacob Zuma is expected to resume his testimony at the State Capture Commission on Friday. The commission adjourned on Wednesday to allow more time for deliberations over the concerns the former president had raised relating to his questioning. Zuma complained that he is being cross-examined and expected to remember details of events that had nothing to do with his position as head of state. Having expressed reservations from day one about the Commission’s terms of reference, as well as various preparatory processes, the arguments between Zuma’s lawyers and the commission’s evidence leader Adv Paul Pretorius came to a head. Adv Muzi Sikhakhane told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he is of the view that his client was brought to the commission under false pretences, and requested time to advise him to consider his position. After a meeting in chambers, it was announced that both parties will be given more time to consult on a way forward. It is also expected that a large number of people will gather again today in support of the former President. Click below to watch related video:
