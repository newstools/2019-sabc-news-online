Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements Lebogang Maile is expected to give oral testimony when the Alexandra Inquiry resumes in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, on Tuesday morning. The inquiry convened by the Human Rights Commission and the Office of the Public Protector is investigating the socio-economic conditions in the township. Maile is expected to tell the inquiry what problems his department is facing in Alexandra and how they plan to address those challenges. The inquiry follows a spate of protests in the township earlier this year. It is also looking at how these impact the fundamental rights of communities and whether they amount to maladministration, abuse of power, corruption and improper conduct. On Monday, National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole told the inquiry that the Alexandra police station is in desperate need of more resources to ensure efficient policing of the township. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko also testified, saying that a provincial crime summit will be convened this year to find solutions to decrease the high crime rate in the province, particularly in Alexandra.
