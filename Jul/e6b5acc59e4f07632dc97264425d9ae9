Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has slammed the National Prosecuting Authority’s attempts to seek private donor funding. He has warned that some of the donors could be among the ‘capitalists’ who may be involved in crimes which include tax evasion. Malema directed his concern to President Cyril Ramaphosa during the Presidency budget vote debate in the National Assembly. Malema says, “When given an opportunity to  appoint the National Director of Public Prosecutions, you outsourced the function and appointed an NDPP (National Director of Public Prosecutions) who is saying the NPA must accept  private donations from private individuals and companies.” “What is South Africa going to be if the prosecuting authorities is funded by private capitalists, who in South Africa are exclusively white and often engaged in many crimes and tax avoidance, massive fraud and illicit financial flows?” Earlier this month, Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola said the NPA will have to find ways and means to get funding in order to fund its operations. Briefing the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services of the National Assembly, Lamola said a financial injection of about R7 million is needed urgently. –Additional reporting by Abra Barbier Click below to watch  Ramaphosa budget vote speech:
