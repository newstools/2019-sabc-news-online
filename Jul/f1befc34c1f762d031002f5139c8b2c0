Parliamentâ€™s Justice and Correctional Services Committee says the matter of the fitness of the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane to hold office, is likely to be heard by them at the beginning of September 2019. Chairperson of the Committee, Bulelane Magwanishe has confirmed that the committee has received communication from the office of the Speaker in regard to this.  Mogwanishe says MPs will only consider the matter after the Parliamentary recess. The request for the removal of Mkhwebane was made by DA Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen. The Speaker has since sent the request to the Justice and Correctional Services Committee for consideration.  Magwanishe says MPs have not yet had a chance to discuss the issue. He says a provisional date of 3 September has been set down. Earlier in July, the Helen Suzman Foundation also made a similar request to the Speaker. Their call came after a Constitutional Court ruling that ordered her to pay 15% of the legal bill in the Reserve Bank and Absa/Bankorp matter. WATCH RELATED VIDEOS BELOW:
