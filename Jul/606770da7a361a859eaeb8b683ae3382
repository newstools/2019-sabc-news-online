The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has successfully mediated in meetings between residents of Plettenberg Bay,  municipal officials and the local business chamber. This follows violent service delivery protests a couple of weeks ago, when the N2 was blocked for several days and numerous businesses were looted. The chairperson of the Plett Business Chamber, Mike Scholtz, says the different parties have agreed on a feedback meeting within a fortnight. “If the municipality does not supply on time what they promised, they’ll be taken to task. If the community gets upset about something not on the list, they’ll be taken to task. Hopefully we can have that understanding in the town as a community that we’re one community, we work together, we’ll assist one another, but we’ll not tolerate criminality or violence anymore,” adds Scholtz.
