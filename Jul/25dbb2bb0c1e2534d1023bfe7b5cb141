The Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says her department will be the first to expropriate land to build houses as soon as the enabling legislation is passed. Speaking ahead of her budget vote, Sisulu says through land expropriation the department will deliver housing projects closer to cities, thereby reversing spatial patterns. She says the city of Cape Town is at the top of her list for expropriation. Government has delivered millions of low cost houses since the dawn of democracy. Despite this, many more remain on the waiting list. Lack of land has been blamed for this. But Sisulu says there is a plan – the envisaged expropriation process will alleviate this. “When the legislation is put out for comment, we are able to include comments. And the inclusion we are putting is that Human Settlements would like to be first takers. And when that is done, our target is Cape Town.” The Minister says more and more foreigners are buying low-cost housing intended for the poor. “The language that you find now in Cosmo City is largely foreign. If we were to do a census of ownership of houses in Cosmo City, you will find that 67% of those that we gave away free, now belong to foreign nationals. The free houses that we give to our people are as a result of what we have gone through as a country. However, we do have rental stock, and we would like foreign nationals in our country to stick to that. Our houses are for our people.” Sisulu also said 30%  of new social housing projects will be earmarked for student accommodation.
