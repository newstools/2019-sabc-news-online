The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal will soon be announcing its decision on embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede who is on extended leave after a corruption case was filed against her. This announcement follows the completion of a report by an ANC committee that was established to advise the party. KwaZulu-Natal ANC eThekwini Region Convener Kwazi Mshengu says the much-anticipated decision on the Mayor will be communicated soon. “When the ANC noted the charges that were laid against comrade Zandile Gumede, including the bail condition that were attached, so in its wisdom the ANC then established a team to look into all these allegations but also advise the ANC on how it needs to handle the matter of the bail conditions related to comrade Zandile Gumede.” “I am aware that the committee had completed its work and submitted to the officials and the officials will then take through all the structures.” “I am quite certain that in a space of no time a decision of the ANC will be communicated in public on how we intend to stabilize the functioning of the municipality but also the political challenges affecting the ANC eThekwini region.” Related video click below:
