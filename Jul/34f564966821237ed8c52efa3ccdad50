Illegal small scale miners in the Sekhukhune district of Limpopo have called on the Mineral Resources Department to issue them with mining permits. Most residents are mining chrome, including in their backyards. Some have lost their lives while others were injured during the mining process. Sekhukhune Small Scale Mining Association secretary – David Kgoete – says they would like to be treated like their counterparts in the Northern Cape who were given permits. “As the Zama-Zamas we want to receive money legally not illegally because there are a lot that is happening that is caused by illegal mining. So we want them to make an intervention to give us the mining permits so that as a small scale mining association, we need to be seen mining legally rather than illegal mining. Since the deputy minister has left so it seems we are not getting any help anymore, so we need the minister to be intervening in this regard.”
