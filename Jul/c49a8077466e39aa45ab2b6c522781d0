Former Transport Minister, Ben Martins, has told the State Capture Commission that the Gupta family initially sought permission for a welcoming party on the tarmac of the OR Tambo International Airport after wedding guests disembarked from the plane. The plane ultimately landed at the Waterkloof Air Force Base on April 30, 2013. He says he later heard from the Air Traffic and Navigation Services that the plane had entered South African airspace. Martins said he was contacted by Acting Airports Company CEO, Bongani Maseko about the first request. “The permission request that they sought was upon the aircraft landing at OR Tambo airport when the guests disembark from the plane there should be a welcoming reception and Mr Maseko explained to me that it would be unlikely for anybody to give permission for a welcoming reception to take place there,” explain Martins.
