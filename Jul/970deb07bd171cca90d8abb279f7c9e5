Former African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament (MP) Ben Turok has described party Secretary General Ace Magashule’s reaction to revelations that former Minister Derek Hanekom had met with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) as over the top. Turok says when dealing with the matter, the situation at the time should be taken into account. He says it was clear former President Jacob Zuma had identified himself as a friend of the Gupta family and everyone was concerned about state capture. “Malema has an interest in provoking trouble in the ANC. He has certainly a great interest in doing so. So, before the SG accepts Malema’s version of what happened, he should call Hanekom to a meeting to discuss it and give Hanekom a chance to explain. Thereafter, the disciplinary committee must meet and do the thing (sic) properly and not through the media.” There have been calls for Hanekom’s suspension and removal from the NEC after EFF ‘s allegation that Hanekom conspired with the party to oust the former President Jacob Zuma through a motion of no confidence in the National Assembly. Hanekom admitted meeting EFF secretary-general Gordrich Gardee. ANC NEC meeting Meanwhile, the ANC remains mum on the agenda of its National Executive Committee meeting that is under way at Irene outside Pretoria. Speculation is rife that the spy allegations by former President Jacob Zuma at the State Capture Commission will make it to the agenda of the meeting. Another issue that is suspected to be hotly debated is NEC member Derek Hannekom’s admission that he met with the EFF to discuss the ousting of Zuma. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe says they will only brief the media at the end of weekend meeting.
