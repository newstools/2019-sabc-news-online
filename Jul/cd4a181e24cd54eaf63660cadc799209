North West Education MEC Mmaphefo Matsemela has described the continued attacks on teachers as disturbing. Police are still searching for suspects who shot and killed a Grade 12 teacher at Rakoko Secondary School in Mabeskraal, outside Rustenburg. A Life Orientation and English teacher, Christina Raphokwane, was shot dead at the gate of her home while waiting for the school bus earlier this week. Provincial Education Spokesperson Elias Malindi says it’s important for communities to value teachers. “This is more difficult to the department, especially that now that the learners will be writing their preliminary examinations in the next month. Teachers are a light to the society. So, if we lose them like this, our nation will not have teachers at the end,” says Malindi.
