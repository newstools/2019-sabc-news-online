Tributes are pouring in for Soshanguve born Mandla Maseko, popularly known as “Spaceboy” and “Afronaut”, who has passed away in a motorbike crash. He was to become the first black African in space after becoming one of just 23 people to win a ticket into space – sponsored by the Axe Apollo Space Academy. Details of his memorial service and funeral  will be announced this week. “It is really a shattering moment for family and friends. Mandla was really an amazing person. While we did not like his biking scene, it has caused so much pain and taken him away from us,” says family spokesperson, Sthembile Shabangu. Shabangu says the family understands that he appreciated his time with his Tshwane legend bikers and that it made him happy. “The bike he was on collided with a car and he was in Pretoria West. The Mandla that we want to remember is the Mandla that used to laugh,  the Mandla that used to want to inspire the children of Africa,” says  Shabangu. Watch : Mandla Maseko aka “Spaceboy” dies
