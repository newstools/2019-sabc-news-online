The African National Congress (ANC) has lost its application for leave to appeal against the deployment of one of its members to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). The Johannesburg High Court has ordered the party to reinstate Ponani Makhubele to the NCOP. Makhubele’s name was mysteriously removed from the list of party members going to parliament shortly after the general elections. The ANC and Makhubele earlier reached an agreement to send her to the NCOP, but the agreement was not honoured. Makhubele has expressed relief. “It’s not a victory for me but is a victory for all members of the ANC who continue to suffer depression because of the injustices that are taking place within the organisation. The ANC didn’t honour their own settlement agreement. They also didn’t respect the court ruling so today they’ve lost a leave to appeal the court has ruled that they must also pay costs. The only thing that I’m expecting from now on is the ANC to implement the court order that’s all that I expect from them and nothing else.”
