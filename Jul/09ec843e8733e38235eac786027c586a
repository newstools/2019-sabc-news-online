Sentencing of convicted fraudster, Portia Sizani has been postponed to the 6 August at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Port Elizabeth. Sizani was found guilty of 15 counts of fraud and nine counts of money laundering. She defrauded the Department of Education of R1.2 million by creating ghost teachers. Sizani was the early childhood development district coordinator at the time. She is the wife of Stone Sizani, the South African Ambassador to Germany. This week was scheduled for sentencing procedures, but the defence has made an application for a special review of a section of the state’s case relating to practitioners Curriculum Vitaes (CVs). Defence Advocate, Johan Wessel says although Sizani has been found guilty, Magistrate Mputumi Mpofu made a mistake when he forced the defence to close its case. He said documents such as CVs were never handed for his perusal during the marathon trial, which meant he could not strengthen Sizani’s defence in that regard. He argued that this missing evidence was crucial. But prosecutor Ronelle Brink argued that the review would only delay the case, and that the defence must now appeal after the sentencing has been passed. Magistrate Mpofu says the ruling will be ready by Friday, but can only be presented in court on the 6 August.
