Radio and television journalist, Redi Tlhabi‘s lawyers have confirmed that they have applied to the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture to cross-examine the former president Jacob Zuma. During his appearance before the commission last week, Zuma accused Tlhabi of working on a film that is intended to portray him as a rapist despite him being acquitted on a rape charge in 2007. In response, Webber Wentzel partner and media lawyer, Dario Milo wrote to the commission saying that the allegations had created the impression that Tlhabi was part of a group of individuals who are attempting to assassinate Zuma’s character. Milo says the allegations have harmed Tlhabi’s reputation.
