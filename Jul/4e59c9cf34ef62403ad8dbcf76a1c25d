City Power says electricity will be fully restored on Thursday to parts of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. Technicians were unable to complete the work on Wednesday due to shacks built around and along the wall of the substation. The substation caught fire on Tuesday night plunging large parts of the township into darkness. “A process was already underway to build a new one as part of upgrading electricity infrastructure across Alexandra township. A total of R16 million has been budgeted this financial year for the upgrade of this substation that caught fire,” says City Power Spokesperson, Isaac Mangena.
