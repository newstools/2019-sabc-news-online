The former head of  State Protocol Bruce Koloane has attributed his supposed approval of the landing of the Gupta plane at the Waterkloof Air Force Base to a misunderstanding between himself and his personal assistance. Koloane was testifying on Monday before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, during which he was asked about an email in which his personal assistant indicated to the International Relations Assistant William Matjila that Kolaoane had telephonically approved the request for the landing. Matjila had earlier indicated that the necessary documentation for the approval was not in place. Koloane says he simply indicated to his Personal Assistant that Matjila must process the delays in dealing with the Indian High Commission’s request. “I even further said to my PA, ‘Please make sure that the following people are copied, so that because I’m in a meeting they can also follow up’. There are two people copied who are senior managers. If I was of an agenda to do something dubious, why would I say let’s copy some senior managers within protocol who know exactly what process must be followed? I think, for me, there was purely and issue of either I failed to get across to her properly or it was a case of a pure misunderstanding.”  Click below for more on the story:
