The City of Cape Town says it has helped hundreds of homeless people to get off the streets through its various social interventions offered at its Culemborg Safe Space. The City came under fire this week for issuing fines to the homeless for breaking municipal by-laws. The City says the Safe Space is a transitional space for street people to overnight and to receive social assistance. Head of the Street People’s Unit, Lorraine Frost says they also offer personal development plans to the homeless. “We work with street people on a daily basis and this is a transitional space for them to be overnight and be safe … to access development opportunities; our rehabilitation opportunities; health clinics that we have on site and various services that we provide on-site including; economic opportunities; IT training and various other opportunities that there are available on site for the upliftment of street people.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
