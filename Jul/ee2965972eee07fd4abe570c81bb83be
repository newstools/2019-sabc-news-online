Police are investigating an incident in which four toddlers from the same family were burnt to death in Pelepele village in Mbizana, Eastern Cape. The incident happened on Saturday. According to police reports, the toddlers were sleeping in the bedroom of a three-roomed flat when it suddenly caught fire. It is alleged that the children were last seen playing outside the main house before they disappeared. It looks like they got tired and went to sleep in the outside three-bedroom flat. Their family was alerted by a neighbour about the flat that was on fire. It was discovered that the electricity cords, which supply power from the main house to the flat, caused the fire inside the room, leading to the death of all four of them. Police have opened an inquest into the death of the toddlers.
