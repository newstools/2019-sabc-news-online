African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, has described NEC member Derek Hanekom as a wedge driver and on a mission to divide the ruling party. The former Tourism Minister says it was not a secret that he held meetings with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and other organisations over a quest to oust former president Jacob Zuma from office. On Tuesday, EFF leader Julius Malema launched a scathing attack on Hanekom and the South African Communist Party’s (SACP) Solly Mapaila, telling his party supporters that it’s strange that they are now called “fascists” after they plotted with them to remove Zuma from power. In a statement, Magashule says the ANC is dismayed by Hanekom’s confession that he held meetings with the EFF to indicate that he and other ANC MPs would support the EFF’s vote of no confidence in Zuma. Magashule says Hanekom always blamed all the ANC bad publicity on Zuma in NEC meetings. He further says Hanekom and other ANC MPs put pressure on the National Assembly speaker to accede to the EFF’s demand of a secret ballot during the no confidence motion. Magashule has accused what he calls “ANC sleepers” of helping the EFF in its quest to divide the governing party and to displace it. However, Hanekom says there was nothing wrong with the meetings as they had a common interest at the time. Watch a related video below:
