The Democratic Alliance (DA) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) say they will not attend any council meetings until Mongameli Bobani is removed as mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. This is further putting the metro at risk of not being able to pass motions required for the smooth running of the city. Both opposition parties want a credible chief financial officer (CFO),  but have opposed processes the mayor has followed in filling this position. The metro still doesn’t have a CFO. Last week the DA walked out, leaving no quorum for the appointment. This week the party, joined by the ACDP, didn’t enter chambers after learning that that the motion of no confidence against Mayor Bobani was not on the agenda. They also wanted the appointment of the acting CEO and not just the CFO on the agenda. The Speaker, Buyelwa Mafaya, says the DA did not follow due process regarding the motion of no confidence.  The meeting called by the mayor, was only for the appointment of executive directors. It was adjourned with no agenda issue discussed. The Speaker said she would have a meeting with the mayor and the MEC on the way forward for the governance of the metro.
