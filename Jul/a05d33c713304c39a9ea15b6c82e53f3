Parliament’s lawyers say it is up to the institution to determine the process to decide the fate of axed senior NPA officials Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. President Cyril Ramaphosa fired Jiba and Mrwebi on the recommendation of retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, who found them unfit for their roles in the NPA. Senior legal adviser Siviwe Njikelana told a joint sitting of Parliament’s Select and Portfolio Committees that there is no specific rule within the rules of Parliament on the procedure to be followed on the matter. He urged Parliament to act fairly and speedily. “The requirement that you will need as Parliament that whatever procedure you decide to adopt-it must be fair. Fairness in law means that both parties must be heard before a decision is taken.” Related video click below:
