Legal expert, Lebohang Mokhele says convicted racist, Vicki Momberg will find it difficult to evade a prison sentence if she doesn’t comply with a court order. Momberg was given 30 days by the High Court in Johannesburg to file her papers for leave to appeal both her conviction and sentence at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. The 30 consecutive calendar days expired on Sunday. Momberg was warned to hand herself over to authorities to complete the remainder of her sentence should she fail to file her papers at the SCA within the prescribed time. Mokhele says the only ground for being late from Momberg would be to resort to legal technicalities relating to court days. “No, they won’t have a legal standing because the court says a party has 30 days to file a particular application with the court. That 30 days exclude holidays and weekend. The days will count as a normal day between Monday and Friday. So, if 30 days passes a person won’t have a legal standing in order to challenge ruling of the court,” says Mokhele.
