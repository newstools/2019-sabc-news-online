A large police contingency has been deployed to the KaNyamazane Stadium, east of Mbombela,  Mpumalanga, where the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema will address the rally as part of the EFF’s sixth anniversary celebrations on Saturday. Communities in and around the area say they are desperate for proper basic services, including water and road infrastructure. The EFF is the official opposition in Mpumalanga where it’s more than doubled its support since the 2014 election. Provincial Police Spokesperson, Mtsholi Bhembe says their members have been deployed in and around the stadium to deal with any criminal activities. “We can confirm that our members are here. All relevant members. Not only the police, but also the other roleplayers; members from disaster management; emergency services. Security are here without fear or prejudice. Anyone who breaks the law or takes chances and thinks they are going to go unpunished, they will be taken to task. Anyone who will come here with their ill intentions, definitely they will be put behind bars.”  The provincial party leader Collen Sedibe says transportation has been provided for supporters from different regions in Mpumalanga. Sedibe says the Malema’s address will focus on the party’s achievements. “As you can see people are beginning to come in buses are dropping people many are still outside will be ready by the time the president’s time to address comes. Obviously we will touch on the achievements of the EFF in the six years – both as political party and as opposition party, in government and the other issues. We cannot predict but because it is a birthday, he has to reflect on where we come from and where we are the going too.” Watch  livestream of EFF’s sixth anniversary:
