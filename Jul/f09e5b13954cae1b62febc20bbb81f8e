The trial of controversial pastor, Timothy Omotoso, resumes in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday. A new judge will preside over the trial after Judge Mandela Makaula recused himself. The recusal was related to his wife’s ownership of a guesthouse, where some state witnesses were accommodated. Omotoso’s legal team claimed that he was biased towards first witness, Cheryl Zondi and overly sympathetic. Defence lawyer, Peter Daubermann approached the Constitutional Court to file an application for Makaula to recuse himself after the Supreme Court of Appeal rejected his application. Makaula told the court that he was doing it in the interests of justice and that his wife was a sole director of the close corporation. Omotoso and his co-accused‚ Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Sulani‚ face a total of 97 charges ranging from rape to human trafficking. Watch a related video below:
