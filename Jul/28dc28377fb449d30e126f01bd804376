Sudanese protest leaders told AFP Friday talks with the country’s army rulers have been postponed, just days after the two sides signed a power sharing deal. “The talks have been postponed,” said prominent protest leader Omar al-Digeir. “We need more internal consultation to reach a united vision,” he added, with no new date set for negotiations to resume. Another protest leader, Siddig Youssef, also confirmed the talks had been suspended.
