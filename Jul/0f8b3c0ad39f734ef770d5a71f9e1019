Police in Durban have reportedly used stun grenades to disperse a group of protestors supporting eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede. They are blocking a road juncture near Durban’s City Hall causing traffic disruptions, demanding her immediate return to office. This comes after her forced leave of absence, due to corruption charges against her, was extended for a further 30 days by the African National Congress on Wednesday. Traffic is now being redirected from Field Street to avoid the roadblock at the corner of Dorothy Nyembe and Doctor Pixley KaSeme Streets, formerly West Street. One of the protest organisers Mzo Dube says, “The is no formal communication that has been conveyed to the mayor, the leave that the mayor took, is a leave of absence based on the leave form that lapsed yesterday (Wednesday), There is nothing really that I can rely on because yesterday the provincial secretary was pointing to a very long leave that was given to the mayor.” Click below to watch related video:
