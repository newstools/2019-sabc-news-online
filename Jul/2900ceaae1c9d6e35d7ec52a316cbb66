The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says the not guilty verdict in the case of Duduzane Zuma, the son of former president Jacob Zuma is fair. The Randburg Magistrate’s Court north of Johannesburg, on Friday morning found Zuma not guilty of culpable homicide as well as reckless and negligent driving. This relates to a 2014 incident in which Zuma lost control of his luxury vehicle and crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. This resulted in the death of of Phumzile Dube, one of the passengers in the taxi. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says they respect the court’s decision. “As the NPA we respect the court’s decision. We believe that the presiding officer applied his mind and came up with this judgment. As the NPA we believe it is a fair judgment and it considered the facts brought before court in its entirety.
