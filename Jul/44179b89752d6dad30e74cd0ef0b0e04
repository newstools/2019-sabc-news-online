Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says the party will seek further clarity on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)  investigations into President Cyril Ramaphosa after Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that the President deliberately misled Parliament about a 2017 Bosasa donation. The Public Protector has found that President Ramaphosa lied to Parliament about the R500 000 campaign donation. The complaint was laid by DA leader Maimane, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu and a whistle-blower. Mkhwebane has now directed the National Assembly to refer President Ramaphosa’s violation of the Executive Code of Ethics to the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests for consideration. She has also referred money laundering allegations to the NPA. Maimane was speaking during a media briefing in Parliament. “If this was a direct donation to a campaign, why did it have to go through multiple accounts at the level that it is? “It did raise questions and suspicions of money laundering. We will seek further clarity that did the Public Protector mean the new investigative directorate within the NPA that has been recently established to be able to do the investigation? “The NPA must respond to a criminal case. We will then investigate whether there should be a criminal case opened against Ramaphosa and the campaign team.” Click video below:
