The funeral for former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker, Marc Batchelor, will take place on Thursday at the Crossing Church in Midrand. The funeral will start shortly and is open to the public and the media. Batchelor was shot and killed last week Monday outside his home in Olivedale, in the north of Johannesburg. Police have confirmed that Batchelor was attacked by two men as he was entering his house. A case of murder has been opened. The funeral was initially scheduled to take place on Friday but was moved out of respect for legend and icon, Johnny Clegg, whose memorial will be held on Friday. Click on the video below:
