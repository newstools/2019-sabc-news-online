The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) is demanding action be taken against Finance Minister Tito Mboweni following comments he made on Twitter regarding e-tolls. A war of words played out on Twitter between Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the minister. During his recent State of the Province Address, Makhura assured motorists that his government is working to get rid of e-tolls as they believe the tolling system has no future in Gauteng, but Mboweni fired back on social media, insisting that e-tolls are here to stay. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says the department will present the report about the status of e-tolls in Gauteng province in August 2019. This follows a directive from the President that the issue must be thoroughly discussed. Mbalula was speaking in Durban at the N3 Marrianhill Toll Plaza where law enforcement agencies and the department held a post-Durban July road block. Mbalula says the issue of e-tolls needs a collective decision and the participation of all relevant structures.  Watch Cosatu GautengÂ Chairperson Amos Monyela on the issue:
