ECB chief Mario Draghi warned Thursday that the outlook for inflation in the single currency bloc is worsening, as the bank signaled its readiness to unleash a new package of stimulus to boost the economy. “Inflationary pressures remain muted and indicators of inflation expectations have declined. Therefore, a significant degree of monetary stimulus continues to be necessary,” the head of the European Central Bank told a news conference.
