Mpumalanga government says it’s forging ahead in addressing unemployment. This is especially among the youth and women. Delivering her State of the Province Address, Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane announced the launch of a R250-million Youth Development Fund. Unemployment figures are soaring, job creation, economic development, health and education – high on the list of priorities. Mtshweni-Tsipane hopes to address the challenge.  “We have decided to take a bold step and launch a Youth Development Fund to the tune of R250 million over the next five years. The provincial government shall develop a unit to manage the fund.” And there are plans to address socio-economic challenges facing the province, among them service delivery. “We shall build 100 000 housing opportunities, special attention will be given to fastest urbanising towns.” The Premier expressed disappointment over the performance of municipalities, only one municipality received a clean audit. “We urge our accounting officers to effectively manage the public resources entrusted to them, failing which they shall pay back the money, literally.” But opposition parties reacted with different views.
