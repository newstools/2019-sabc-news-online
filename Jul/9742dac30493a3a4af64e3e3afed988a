The African National Congress (ANC)  has expressed concern about the public spat on Twitter, between Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni and Gauteng Premier, David Makhura over eTolls. Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says the issue of communication between members who are deployed in government needs urgent intervention. He says the Mboweni -Makhura matter will be discussed at the next ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, and proper action will be taken if either of them is found to have violated party policies and conduct. “We are quite concerned with how our own members, including those deployed in positions of responsibility are using some media platforms. We need to remind members of the ANC about the communication protocol which guides and governs the conduct of our members, including those in government.  Social media, especially Twitter or Facebook, these are not the right platforms to ventilate issues of concern, including where there are policy disagreement.” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has also expressed his concern at the Twitter spat between Makhura and Mboweni, saying they “are unbecoming of their high offices”.
