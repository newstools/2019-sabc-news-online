The African National Congress (ANC) says it will look into reports regarding National Executive Committee member Derek Hanekom contacting the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) about plans to remove then-President Jacob Zuma from office, but will not take any action until they have all the details. Hanekom has told South African Broadcasting Corporation – SABC News about meetings he had with EFF Secretary General Godrich Gardee to discuss ways to oust Zuma. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe has cautioned against assumptions without the details of the meeting. “The ANC has learnt this out in the media. I have seen a text that you have played out as well, purporting to be from Comrade Derek Hanekom where he was indeed confirming that such a meeting has happened. But what you and I are not being told and the people of South Africa is what could have been the details of such a meeting. I wouldn’t want us to get into that.”  Mabe adds that the party has a constitution that deals with issues of members’ conduct.  “If there are things that are done by anyone, even if it was to be myself, which are perceived or understood to be bringing the party into disrepute, there are rules, or there are conditions that are laid under which the ANC will have to act.” This new revelation from Hanekom comes at a time the ANC has announced a special committee that will investigate allegations – that some of its senior members have been working with the opposition during the May elections. This and other issues, including Zuma’s evidence at the State Capture, are expected to dominate discussions at the ANC NEC meeting this weekend.
