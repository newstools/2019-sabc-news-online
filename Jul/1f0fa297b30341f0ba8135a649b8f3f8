The civil rights movement AfriForum will apply for an urgent interdict in the High Court in Pretoria to stop the City of Tshwane from implementing new electricity tariffs. Electricity regulator, NERSA had refused to approve Tshwane’s tariffs for the 2019/20 financial year. However the City implemented the proposed tariffs in contravention of the Electricity Regulation Act. The City claims that the tariff increase is within regulators approved 13,7%, and says it was the executive authority, thus implementing the tariff. AfriForum’s Morne Mostert says they are determined to stop the exploitation of consumers, especially pre-paid electricity users. Morstert says, “City of Tshwane implemented a tariff that has not been approved by Nersa. This means that the tariff is unlawful and AfriForum is going to court firstly to ensure that Tshwane cannot continue to implement the unlawful tariffs and secondly we’re going to court to ensure that Nersa, as the regulator, implements remedies to ensure that the city cannot implement unlawful tariffs.”
