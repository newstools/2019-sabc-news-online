Productivity has improved at the Port of Ngqura in Port Elizabeth following a two weeks “go slow” by workers over incentives. The action resulted in the citrus and automotive industry losing millions of rands as goods could not be imported nor exported through the ports. Transnet has obtained an interdict against the workers in the Port Elizabeth Labour Court. It orders them to increase performance levels at the port. “We have seen some improvements in the levels of performance in the past 24 hours to 36 hours. I think all of this is a results of us interacting with the employees encouraging them to focus more on the goal and not lose sight of what Transnet’s  mandate is, “says spokesperson,  Molatwane Likhethe.
