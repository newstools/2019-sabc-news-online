The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it will go to the Constitutional Court to challenge the suspension of the Public Protector’s remedial action against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, pending a judicial review into the South African Revenue Service (SARS) Rogue Unit matter. The High Court in Pretoria has interdicted the implementation of Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s recommendations – including that President Cyril Ramaphosa discipline him within 30 days. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says they are not surprised by the court’s decision. “The judge was very pleased and willing to listen and hear the arguments of all those whites whilst showing irritation to the extent of constantly interrupting the black lawyers in the proceedings. It is as if those black lawyers did not belong in that court.” “Nevertheless we believe that the interdict essentially shuts down what is a constitutionally created institution. We shall therefore appeal this decision with the Constitutional Court because it is a fight to the end.” Click video below:
