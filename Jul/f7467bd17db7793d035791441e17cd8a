The Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says the current and past cabinet ministers and their deputies should submit affidavits detailing if and under what circumstances they had interacted with the Gupta family and Bosasa. On Friday, the Commission released President Cyril Ramaphosa’s affidavit on his engagements with the Gupta brothers. This after he asked the commission to make it public. In the affidavit, Ramaphosa says he saw the Gupta brothers two or three times at events, but that he only had a meeting with them in 2016 to discuss the closure of their bank accounts. Zondo says a few months ago, he told Ramaphosa that senior government officials and members of the African National Congress (ANC) needed to testify. “President Ramaphosa indicated that he fully agreed with me, that it was necessary for leaders in government and the ruling party to come before the Commission and make their inputs. They should say what they know, explain what they need to; and he embraced the idea. He gave me an undertaking that if and when I say he should come to the Commission to give evidence, he will come,” says Zondo. The Commission is in recess for the next two weeks. It will resume its hearings on August 12.
