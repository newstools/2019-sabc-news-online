The eThekwini Municipality has started to demolish a number of derelict buildings in Durban. Itâ€™s part of a R62 billion inner city rejuvenation project. The first three buildings targeted, are in the Point area in the Mahatma Gandhi precinct. Most of these buildings were occupied by vagrants and are also thought to have provided shelter to criminals. More than 100 buildings are to be demolished or revamped as part of the project. The city says homeless people will be accommodated in a new building. Residents have also welcomed the plan, amid growing concerns over crime in the city. Property owners have been urged to work with the city. Acting eThekwini Municipality Mayor Fawzia Peer says bringing down the buildings will help fight growing crime in the city. WATCH BELOW:
