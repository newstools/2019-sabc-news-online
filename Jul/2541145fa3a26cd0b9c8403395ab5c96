The names of the two African National Congress (ANC) officials who have been shot and killed in Limpopo have been released. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says the deceased are Mogalakwena municipal councillor Valtyn Kekana aged 54 and ANC secretary in the Mogalakwena sub-region, 32 year old Ralph Kanyane. Kekana was also chair of the municipal public accounts committee. “A high level investigative team has been established to track down the killers of two people that were gun down in Mokopane this afternoon the deceased are known as Vtyn Kekana and Ralph Kanyane were shot and killed by unknown suspects anybody with information is requested to contact captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501” Mojapelo says. The two were ambushed while seated in the car.   It is alleged two armed men shot them at close range before fleeing the scene. The local municipality has been embroiled in factional battles. ANC members are shocked by this brutal killing. ANC member Thabiso Montana says that the ANC must do something about the incident. “I am very shocked, ANC must do something. We are going to close the municipality. The Premier must come here and tell us who is fighting… We are very shocked, we can’t watch the space we will defend ourselves. We are trained soldiers of uMkhonto Wesizwe.” ANC members are threatening to close the municipality on Wednesday.
