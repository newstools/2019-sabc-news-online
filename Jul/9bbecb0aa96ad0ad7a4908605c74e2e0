Two people have been arrested in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal following a car chase and shootout with police in the city. One of the suspects was wounded in the incident and a third suspect got away. Police say they gave chase after the three tried to flee after allegedly buying liquor with a fraudulent credit card. The two who were arrested are facing charges of fraud, theft and attempted murder. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Nqobile Gwala, says an Umbilo police task team was busy with an operation on King Dinuzulu Road when they saw the three suspects carrying something to a car. “And when the suspects noticed the police they sped off and then there was a shootout. Then the suspects’ vehicle fled towards the Mayville area where the shooting continued and two suspects were apprehended and the third one managed to flee the scene on foot,” says Gwala.
