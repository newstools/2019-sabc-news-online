The Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu, is expected to appear before the Alexandra Inquiry when it resumes in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Friday morning. The inquiry convened by the Human Rights Commission and the Office of the Public Protector is probing the socio-economic conditions in Alex. It is also looking at how this impacts the fundamental rights of communities. Audit reports on the Alexandra Renewal Project are expected to feature prominently when the Auditor General testifies at the inquiry. Today is the final day of the inquiry, after which the panel will compile a report of recommendations for government to resolve the issues plaguing the township. On Thursday, Gauteng Department of Social Development, HOD, Thembeni Mhlongo highlighted child abuse and domestic violence as a major problem in Alexandra. Mhlongo says that a number of social work programmes have had to be implemented in the township in an attempt to address this problem.
