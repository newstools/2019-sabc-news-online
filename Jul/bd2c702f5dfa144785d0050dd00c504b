Gauteng Premier David Makhura has been accused of simply copying President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address in his State of the Province Address (Sopa). Makhura emphasised the need to tackle Gauteng’s challenges with urgency and transparency in the first state of the province address of his second term in Soweto. The speech focused on the economy, which formed part of his five top priorities. During his Sopa address, Makhura gave the MECs a 100 day deadline to provide reports and feedback in their respective portfolios. Political analyst Lesiba Teffo says, “Africans talk a lot and act less, what Makhura said, 90% is not new.Ninety percent of it was said by the President and I can assure you, come five years down the line the next President would be saying the same things with very little progress going forward.” “It’s about time we act and implement. I am saying South Africans in general, we spend too much time talking and act less. I can speak to the question of the land but it ought to have been addressed in the past 20-years,” adds Teffo.
