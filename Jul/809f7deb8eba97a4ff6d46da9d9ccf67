Malawian Minister of Communications, Mark Botomani, says the much reported political tension in Malawi will not derail the current government in its task of rebuilding the economy. Botomani says the government is waiting for the Constitutional Court to hear the opposition case challenging the outcome of the Presidential elections. Peter Mutharika was declared the winner in the recently held Presidential election. Malawi is a Southern African country that shares a border with Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania. With an estimated population of 17.5 million, it is one of the poorest countries on the continent. Among the challenges faced by the country is rebuilding areas devastated by Cyclone Idai. The government says it is rebuilding the houses that were destroyed. Another challenge the government has to contend with is the surge in protests following the May election. The opposition is refusing to accept the results of the presidential poll. Botomani also addressed the issue of perceived tensions between the military and the police. “They are working together yes. At time you will find a situation where there is misunderstanding, but there is no problem.” He also said there was no problem with the President’s health. “It is not true that the president is not well. Before elections, the reports were that he is dead, it’s just fake news.” Malawi is a relatively peaceful country but the recent protests have sparked fears that the country could experience political instability.
