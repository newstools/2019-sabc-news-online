South Africans have been urged to keep a close eye out for a strong cold front approaching the western parts of South Africa. The South African Weather Service says temperatures are also expected to remain low across parts of the Northern and Eastern Cape. It says the cold front is expected to move inland – with cold conditions expected across Gauteng and Mpumalanga. SABC weather forecaster Azwi Tuwani says, “The Western Cape has another intense cold front heading towards them, but for the rest temperatures will be warm to a maximum of 19 degrees today and dropping to 12 so temperatures will remain cool in those regions. We are expecting a few clouds that will quickly dissipate for most parts of SA and we are seeing those in Gauteng currently. Partly cloudy skies are expected over the north eastern parts and we are expecting drizzle over the eastern interior and Limpopo for today. We have a high fire danger over the western parts of Northern Cape. Click link for more on the story
