Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, delivered the State of the Province Address (SOPA) on Friday, laying out the provincial plans. One of the issues she highlighted was service delivery. Mtshweni-Tsipane says Mpumalanga has vision 2030 which is an implementation framework, “We also have the Mpumalanga economic growth path that will guide our implementation program in the next coming five years. Part of our implementation plan will also encapsulate the issues that were raised during the door to door campaign because as the ANC we believe that we are leading with the people on the ground. Everything that they say we take it into consideration.” The premier says Mpumalanga is the only province that managed to drop  poverty levels. “There are initiatives and plans that we have in place to alleviate poverty within our communities. Part of our priorities is to make sure that we turn around the economic landscape of the province.” Mtsweni-Tsipane became acting Premier in February 2018 when President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed David Mabuza as Deputy President, and she was appointed Premier after the May elections.
