Deputy Cooperative Governance minister, Obed Bapela, as well as Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi,  are expected to make submissions to the Alexandra Inquiry, which is set to resume in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. The inquiry convened by the Human Rights Commission and the Office of the Public Protector is investigating the socio-economic conditions in the township. It is also looking at how this impacts the fundamental rights of communities and whether they amount to maladministration, abuse of power, corruption and improper conduct. The inquiry follows a spate of protests in the township earlier this year. On Tuesday, Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile again dismissed suggestions that the Alexandra Urban Renewal Project was allocated R1.3 billion. He also welcomed the City of Johannesburg’s forensic investigation into the Project, as he believes his provincial government will not be implicated in any wrongdoing. Click on the videos below:
