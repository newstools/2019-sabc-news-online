Representatives from the United National Transport Union (UNTU), the Public Service Association( PSA) and the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) have given  Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, until the end of August to respond to their demands, including improving safety on trains. Earlier, the trade unions’ leadership led a march to Parliament where they handed over a memorandum of demands to the Chief Director responsible for rail operations in the Department of Transport, Godfrey Maluleke. Maluleke has promised the trade union members that their demands will be given the attention they deserve. ” I have been asked by the acting director general to receive your memorandum. We are going to take your demands seriously. The normal thing that I will do is to make sure the acting director general receives the memorandum and very interestingly, the minister has appointed a new director general.”
