Former President Jacob Zuma is on Wednesday expected to give his response to the testimony of the former Public Enterprises minister Barbara Hogan. Tuesday’s proceedings were dominated by exchanges between Zuma’s legal counsel and evidence leader Paul Pretorius. Zuma’s lawyers objected to what they said was the cross-examination of their client, arguing that it was in breach of the Commission’s terms of reference. Hogan testified earlier that Zuma insisted on appointing Siyabonga Gama as head of Transnet, despite him facing misconduct charges and against the recommendation of the company’s board. She added that Zuma told her not to appoint anyone until Gama’s disciplinary proceedings were over. Hogan served as Public Enterprises minister from May 2009 until November 2010, when Zuma replaced her with Malusi Gigaba. The former President is expected to give clarity on the matter.
