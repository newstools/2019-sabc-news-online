The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to take a leave of absence pending a judicial review regarding the Public Protector’s report around his Bosasa donation for his 2017 ANC presidential campaign. EFF National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says Ramaphosa is conflicted and is currently in no position to lead the country pending his dispute with the Public Protector. “He is conflicted in this matter and must allow the process to go on without him being at the helm of all institutions of the country as the constitution prescribes. We can’t have a sitting State President or a sitting head of state who has a conflict, who enters into a direct conflict with a Chapter 9 institution and still wants to think he can combat corruption. Ramaphosa must take a leave of absence and allow someone else with integrity to lead until his name has been cleared,” says Ndlozi EFF Statement Below:
