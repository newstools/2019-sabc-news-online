Gauteng residents will continue to experience colder conditions. Gripping cold has hit most parts of the country, with temperatures in Gauteng plummeting to zero in some parts.  As temperatures continue to plunge as a cold front is expected to hit the province, 72 year-old Johanna Moshidi uses a paraffin stove to keep warm. “I keep myself warm with stove and two bottles. I normally place the two bottles in my blankets 30 minutes before I go to bed. It’s not safe to sleep with these bottles, same with this stove; it must stand alone to avoid the fire catching on the walls and furniture.” Emergency services are on high alert. EMS Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi, has urged the public to be cautious. “We want to encourage our residents as they try to warm themselves, to look after all heating devices; paraffin stoves, heaters and not to leave them unattended. Those using mbaulwa must use it in a ventilated area where we can avoid incidents of carbon monoxide and smoke inhalation. Residents in our formal residential areas, we know that they are using heaters and they leave them unattended and especially worse now it’s school holidays; young kids might be left alone with those heating devices.” The weather bureau has forecasted more cold fronts throughout winter. Temperatures across South Africa are expected to drop as the country shivers in the grip of winter. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
