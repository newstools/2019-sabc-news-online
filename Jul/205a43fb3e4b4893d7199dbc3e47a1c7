The number of traffic officers has been increased on all national roads in KwaZulu-Natal ahead of this weekend’s Vodacom Durban July. Thousands of punters are expected to attend the annual horse racing event on Saturday. KwaZulu-Natal’s Chief Director of Road Safety and Traffic Management, Shadrack Nxumalo says the province is already experiencing very high traffic volumes along the N3 highway from Gauteng leading to Durban. “We will be having high visibility on our roads leading to eThekwini. We have identified some areas where we will be conducting roadblocks focusing on drunk and driving and driver behaviour. Activities will go through the night. We have got integrated enforcement. We have National Traffic Police down. You have other law enforcement agencies.”
