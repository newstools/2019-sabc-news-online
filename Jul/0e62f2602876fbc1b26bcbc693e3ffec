President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Lesotho on an official working visit. His first stop was to pay a courtesy call on King Letsie the Third. The President is accompanied by the Defence and State Security ministers, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Ayanda Dlodlo respectively. Currently, President Cyril Ramaphosa is locked in talks with Prime Minister Tom Thabane. Ramaphosa is the South African Development Community (SADC) facilitator on Lesotho’s reform process. He will later meet with other stakeholders on the same matter. On Wednesday, Ramaphosa’s envoy to Lesotho, former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke told the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) that stakeholders will sign an agreement that will pave the way for the implementation of the much talked about constitutional reforms. The country has experienced political instability which is threatening the existence of the coalition government.
