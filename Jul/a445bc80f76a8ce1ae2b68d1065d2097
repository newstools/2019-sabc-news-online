Workers at the National Transport Investment (NTI) entity, operating in areas based in the North West, have raised concerns about job loses. This follows last week’s intervention by Transport Minister Fikile Mabalula who unveiled a fleet of 200 buses which will service Mabopane, Hamanskraal and Atteridgeville. Commuters had been complaining about the inefficient bus service. Spokesperson for the Transport Workers Union, Nelson Madumo, says their members are worried that the majority of buses will be sourced from Gauteng. “Simply says that the job security of our members will be at stake. The MEC of North West Transport is here just to assure the employees of NTI that their jobs are safe and they don’t have to worry about anything. We will still keep on engaging with the Gauteng Department of Transport as well as the minister. If we don’t get joy now, we will apply for an official march, we will be now going to President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene on the situation.” However, the MEC for Transport in the North West Sello Lehari has assured the workers that their jobs are still safe. “Myself, the Minister and the MEC of Gauteng; we never discussed the future or job security for workers of NTI because if that is the case, that means somebody is saying their work will come to an end or they will be terminated or there will be retrenchments. The minister only talked about bringing new buses taking out old buses. I was here just to assure them that for now their jobs are still safe.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
