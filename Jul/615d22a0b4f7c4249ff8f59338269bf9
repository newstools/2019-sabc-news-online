Emotions ran high at the funeral of African National Congress (ANC) Mokgalakwena Local Municipality ward 10 branch secretary Ralph Kanyane. The funeral was held at his home village of Wan Wyk Span in Limpopo. Kanyane was the ward 10 in the violent Mokgalakwena Local Municipality outside Mokopane in Limpopo. Ralph Kanyane‘s funeral was held at his home village of Wan Wyk Span in Limpopo. Kanyane and Councillor Valtyn Kekana were gunned down in the Mokopane CBD on Tuesday by an unknown man. Mourners say the killing of Kanyane and Kekana was an attempt to silence them for speaking the truth about allegations of fraud and corruption by some local politicians and municipal officials. The Chairperson of the ANC Youth League in ward 10 Bozino Ramasobana, who is a friend of Kanyane, says they live in fear as they do not know who is next. “The leaders who are here know that Comrade Ralph was not a sell-out, they killed Ralph for the love of money because he stood for the truth. We once issued a statement that it’s fine to be killed for speaking and standing for the truth.”
