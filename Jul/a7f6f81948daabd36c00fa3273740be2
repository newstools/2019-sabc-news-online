Retail giant, Shoprite-Checkers has distanced itself from a derogatory message on a cake displayed at one of its Cape Town branches, marking Saturday’s Rugby Championship match between the Springboks and the All Blacks in Wellington. A Cape Town customer posted a picture on his Facebook account of the green and gold cake with the message, “Quota Squad”. In his post, Nathan Kolbe asks what Checkers at Protea Heights in Brackenfell was trying to insinuate. The group says in a statement the cake was immediately removed and brought to the branch manager’s attention. Checkers says it was a bad decision taken by a bakery employee and does not represent the supermarket’s view. The match ended in a 16 all draw.
