The security industry regulator Private Security Industry Regulation Act (PSiRA) has suspended the services of the Red Ants pending investigation into their conduct. PSiRA said the suspension of the security services company is due to allegations of improper conduct whilst carrying out evictions. The security industry regulator said it received numerous complaints from the public about the alleged misconduct of the Red Ants including during the recent evictions in Alexandra and Ramaphosa informal settlement in Johannesburg. PSiRA’s Linda Mbana said the suspension means that Red Ants cannot carry out any relocation and eviction services pending the conclusion of the investigation. Mbana says, “What they did when they were doing evictions at Alex and at Ramaphosa and in other places is that there were casualties, human rights were violated, lives were lost, properties were vandalised in a manner that is not orderly. So we don’t take that lightly as PSiRA because we are a regulator that regulates the industry.” WATCH A substation supplying electricity to Marlboro residents is on fire by angry residents. Illegal structures were demolished by red ants earlier today. #Alexdemolish #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/e59SOMU2gy — Ditaba Tsotetsi (@tsotetsiditaba) 31 May 2019
