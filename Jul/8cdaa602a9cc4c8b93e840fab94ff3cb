Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has defended President Cyril Ramaphosa regarding the funding received from Bosasa for his 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found Ramaphosa guilty of misleading Parliament in the R500 000 donation to his campaign. Mathabatha was speaking during the funeral service of struggle veteran Ike Maphoto in Polokwane. Ramaphosa is among the mourners. Mathabatha says there are people who want to divide the ANC by peddling untruths. He says, “Comrades I led the CR17 campaign in this province and there were so many people who were assisting us financially. I don’t think the President knows them, I don’t know them and I think it was good that I don’t know them.”
