Johannesburg residents will pay more for water and electricity from Monday when the new tariff hikes come into effect. Property rates and refuse removal fees are also set to rise. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Finance in the City of Johannesburg, Funzela Ngobeni, says the National Energy Regulator of South Africa’s (NERSA) decision to grant Eskom a more than 41% tariff increase has forced the city to hike its tariffs. He says the city’s electricity tariff will increase from the originally proposed 12.20% to 13.07% across all categories of customers. Customers will pay 9.9% more for water. Property rates and refuse removal tariffs will increase by 5.5% and 7% respectively.
