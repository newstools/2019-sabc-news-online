The case against EFF leader Julius Malema has been postponed to September 9 by the Newcastle Magistrates’ Court in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Malema did not appear in court in person. However he was represented by his legal team. Malema is facing a charge of violating the Riotous Assembly’s Act after he told his party members to occupy vacant land in Newcastle and Bloemfontein. Last week, the Pretoria High Court dismissed Malema’s application to have the act declared unconstitutional. Click related video below:
