The leadership of Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, says it has suspended the planned shutdown that was supposed to take place on Monday, citing fears of looting and xenophobic attacks. A message has been doing rounds on WhatsApp, calling on people of Diepsloot to shut down the township on Monday. Issues raised include electrification of informal settlements, the completion of the R-511 Road Project and the long overdue Diepsloot East Housing. It also called on all illegal immigrants to leave Diepsloot with immediate effect. “We can’t allow a shut down that will give criminals an opportunity to loot the businesses of Diepsloot. So we are trying to avoid that. Yes we are saying there are serious issues that need to be raised but we must find a proper way of addressing them. There were certain issues that we were not happy with, issues in the message which was circulating, for example people from other countries that they should be dealt with,” says Community Leader Sicelo Shezi.
