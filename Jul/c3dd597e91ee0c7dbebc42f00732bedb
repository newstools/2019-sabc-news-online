Former president Jacob Zuma has welcomed the Randburg Magistrate’s Court judgment which found his son Duduzane, not guilty of culpable homicide as well as reckless and negligent driving. This relates to a 2014 incident in which Zuma lost control of his luxury vehicle and crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. This resulted in the death of Phumzile Dube who was one of the passengers in the taxi at that time. The former President says the judgment proves that his son wasn’t driving recklessly. “I feel happy that he’s out, and the case is over. He wasn’t irresponsible when driving the car. It was the weather conditions that caused the accident. The court looked at this fairly and the court’s decision is welcomed.”   Meanwhile lobby group Afriforum says it respects the not guilty verdict delivered in the case. Afriforum’s private prosecutions unit had applied to prosecute the case privately after the NPA initially declined to prosecute citing a lack of evidence. However the prosecutions authority overturned the decision and proceeded with the prosecution.
