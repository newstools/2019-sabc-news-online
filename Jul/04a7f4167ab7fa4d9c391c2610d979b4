Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams will be required to regularly brief the Communications Committee in Parliament about the progress of discussions to address the financial crisis at the SABC. This was confirmed by Communications Committee Chair in Parliament, Hope Papo. He was speaking during the debate on the department’s budget vote. “The committee also noted with concern the serious challenges facing the SABC. The portfolio committee agreed when we adopted the report that the minister will update it on progress in relation to the ongoing engagement between the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies, the SABC and National Treasury on the challenges facing the SABC.” Ndabeni-Abrahams announced on Wednesday that the SABC is to receive interim financial relief from government within the next ten days and a remaining balance in the next 45 days if it meets certain conditions. Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Pinky Kekana has praised the SABC board and employees for keeping the public broadcaster running despite its financial challenges. Kekana was participating in the budget vote debate of the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies on Wednesday in Parliament. She said, “We are truly indebted to the board, the management and the staff of the SABC who have continued to steer the ship through stormy sees which were not through their own doing. We will be working studiously and speedily with G-Tech, SABC current lenders and National Treasury as the Minister outlined to ensure that the SABC get assistance it desperately needs while the Parliamentary processes are being finalised. The department has also identified policies that need to be amended to create an enabling environment for the turnaround and complete recovery of the SABC.”
