Former Public Investment Corporation (PIC) CEO Dan Matjila says he was contacted telephonically by a mysterious man who told him there were some people out to get him because they wanted more funding from the Corporation. The mysterious man instructed him to do as he said. He learnt from the same person that an email containing damming information about him would be sent to the PIC the next day. Matjila says this was the first time he got to know of the James Nogu emails. The emails contained allegations that Matjila facilitated the funding of a business owned by a woman who was said to be his girlfriend. Matjila is testifying for the third day at the commission of inquiry into the PIC being held in Pretoria. “The next morning he called again and said an email will be sent to Mr. Roy Raja and that this email will send Mr. Roy Raja into panic and he will resign. He strongly advised me to persuade Mr. Roy Raja not to resign and indeed at 11 am while in a meeting I received a call to tell me an email had been received by Mr. Roy Raja. Roy came to my office around 12 after my meeting to show me this e-mail dated 31st August 2017 from James Nogu, commissioner this is the very first time that we see an e-mail from James Nogu.” On Tuesday, the former CEO told the PIC commission that politically connected person’s high ranking officials and ministers put him under pressure for funds. He said he was a victim of political interference and greed. He says the ANC also asked him for funding. Click on the video below:
