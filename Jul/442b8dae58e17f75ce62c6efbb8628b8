Mthokozisi Nxumalo has been elected as the national chairperson of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Youth Brigade.  Nxumalo is the former president of IFP-aligned student movement, Sadesmo. He won a highly contested election against Dr Andile Biyela. Nxumalo takes over the reins from the outgoing chairperson, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, who served for eight years. Nxumalo, who is also the IFP’s youngest MP in the National Assembly,  was elected during the highly contested conference held at Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Mlungisi Mabaso was elected Secretary, while Nothando Ngubane was elected Treasurer. The conference should have been held in 2016 but was delayed due to internal issues including mushrooming of bogus branches.   The previous Youth Brigade national conference was held in 2011. On Saturday, the opening was delayed for several hours as leaders attempted to negotiate with Nxumalo and Biyela.  It’s said that there were fears the election could have caused a major rift.  Over 3600 delegates attended. Party President Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi has wished the new leadership well. Buthelezi is expected to step down in August when the party holds its National Elective Conference.
