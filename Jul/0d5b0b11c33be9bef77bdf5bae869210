Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says from Tuesday there will be 200 extra buses to service the areas of Hammanskraal, Mabopane and Atteridgeville. Communities complained about the North West Star bus service – saying buses are always late and people have consequently lost their jobs. Commuters sometimes even have to pay for diesel and toll fees for the buses. Mbalula says the current contract comes to an end in April 2020. It won’t be renewed and a new service provider will be appointed. Mbalula says in the meantime – extra buses will be deployed and extra routes opened. “We’re looking at more or less 200 buses that will be rolled out within a period of four days. The solution for the commuters is to fix NTI, among others, but to bring a new bus service , that’s what we agreed with the MEC and we will go for an open tender to allow people who want to bring a good service to do so.” Click video below: ;
