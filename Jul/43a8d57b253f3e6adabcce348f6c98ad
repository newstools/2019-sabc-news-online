Western Cape traffic authorities say motorists are being pelted with stones in Hanover Park on the Cape Flats. The City of Cape Town’s traffic services say various roads have been closed due to a shutdown in Hanover Park on the Cape Flats. The protest is believed to be linked to high crime levels in the area. Residents say they want to reclaim their streets due to the continued killing of innocent people, especially children. They have also called for increased police visibility. “Due to a Hanover Park shutdown, Hanover Park Avenue is closed at Govan Mbeki Road, there’s no traffic into Hanover Park Avenue. Hanover Park Avenue is also closed at Athwood Road in the direction of Govan Mbeki Road. Surran Road is closed at Stonelands Road in the direction of Hanover Park Avenue. We do have SAPS and law enforcement on scene,” says Richard Coleman.
