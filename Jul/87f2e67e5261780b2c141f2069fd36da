Workers affiliated to the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa(NUMSA) have threatened strike action after negotiations with the Road Accident Fund(RAF) reached a deadlock. The parties have met with the CCMA for wage talks. Workers are demanding a 9% increase and a bonus. The RAF had initially made an offer of 7%, but has now withdrawn it. NUMSA national spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says: “It is outrageous that RAF is denying workers an increase by offering a 0% increase and also rejecting the demand for a 13th cheque.” “The management is provoking workers into embarking on strike action. Both NUMSA and RAF management have exchanged draft picketing rules so that we can work on a final document,” adds Hlubi-Majola.
