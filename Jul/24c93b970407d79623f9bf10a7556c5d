After waiting for longer than a decade, children at Nkungumathe, near Nkandla, are finally getting a school. The High Court in Pietermaritzburg has ruled in favour of the lobby group AfriForum that the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department must build a school for the Nkungumathe community in Nkandla, north of the province. The organisation took the department to court demanding that it builds a secondary school, as promised in 2010. In 2016 it reversed the decision. Pleas fell on deaf ears. In 2017 AfriForum took the department to court after it failed to build the school it had promised the community ten years ago. AfriForum’s deputy CEO, Alana Bailey, says they are very pleased with the court’s judgment, because it means that more than 400 children will not have to cross rivers and walk long distances to school. The provincial education department committed to abide by the ruling. KZN Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu says, “As the department, we are prepared within the limited resources to comply with the order. As you have seen it requires sufficient textbooks and it’s part of our plan of the department that every learner is provided with sufficient learning material.” None of the community members were in court.
