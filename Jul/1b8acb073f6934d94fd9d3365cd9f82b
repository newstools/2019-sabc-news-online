The State Capture Commission has heard how former South African Airways (SAA) board Chair Dudu Myeni interfered in the hiring and firing of staff at the state-owned airline. Former SAA general manager of human resources, Thuli Mpshe told justice Raymond Zondo that it was unusual for non-executive directors to give instructions on the appointment of individuals. She says board members had an oversight role while executives were responsible for the operational side. Mpshe says she told the board’s subcommittee that it was irregular and against recruitment policy to appoint people who are not approved by the structures. She says when she refused to appoint a person Myeni wanted as a COO, she was perceived to be someone who didn’t take instructions from the board “I then said to the chair then, you then give instruction in writing, you change the structures and then we will be able to do it but failing to do that we won’t be able to do it.” Click on the video below:
