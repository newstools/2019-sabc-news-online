South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Acting COO, Dr Craig van Rooyen has hailed the SABC’s Digital platforms performance. Van Rooyen was briefing Parliament’s Communications Committee on Wednesday. He says that the SABC App was voted the best digital news app over the election period. “The SABC has been voted the best digital news app over the election period. In its first weeks of existence, it had 25 000 people download it. I brag because it is one of the most unique apps that exists in Africa where you can watch the SABC live. You can also listen to all 18 radio stations.” Van Rooyen added that the SABC is on OTT. The public broadcaster has partnered with a company called Viu South Africa. So, programmes such as Skeem Saam and Uzalo are available on catch-up online. Van Rooyen says that the SABC is moving into the digital space not just in terms of access to SABC content, but also in the operations of the SABC business. He notes that the SABC is starting to move associated websites into official languages. “If you look at Uzalo at the moment, you now have a vernacular option to go into; it’s in Zulu. In that, you can start accessing and enjoying the two benefits of the website and also gaining access into podcasts.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
