The Western Cape Community Police Forum Board has called for special courts to deal with gang-related cases. Speaking at a Crime Summit in Paarl, Boland, over the weekend, Board Chairperson, Fransina Lukas says they have previously raised the issue with Police Minister Bheki Cele. “We have raised in our memorandum which we have handed over to the Minister during the budget speech. But we are saying no bail. The issue for us is that criminals are coming out on bail and then continue doing these criminal activities,” says Lukas.  ‘Strong community organisation to assist police’ Meanwhile the Western Cape Safety Minister Albert Fritz, has emphasised that the community is an integral part of any crime fighting strategy in the province. Fritz says strong community organisation will assist police in their work. “We must also give our communities power. We have seen where organisations are strong, gangsters are cowards, they disappear. I hear now the gangs have run to KZN; maybe we need an operation like this there as well. But the point we are making is that there’s a program and an action plan.” Fritz was speaking at the conclusion of a two-day crime summit on Sunday in Paarl attended by top police and social cluster ministers.
