Non-Profit Organisation, Corruption Watch, says the African National Congress’ (ANC) decision to send some people that are implicated in state capture to Parliament does not inspire public confidence that the legislative body of government will play its intended oversight role. Some of them include former Communications minister, Faith Muthambi, former Mineral Resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane and former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo who will be chairing Parliamentary portfolio committees. Executive Director of Corruption Watch, David Lewis, says there’s an urgent need to restore public confidence in Parliament. “It doesn’t make one optimistic that Parliament will play the role that it should have been playing and that to some extent in the last year or so and at the beginning of the Ramaphosa administration, there were signs of Parliament playing its proper oversight and accountability role. What just happened with the constitution of the new Parliament doesn’t still run with confidence, I have to say,” says Lewis. Watch a related video below:
