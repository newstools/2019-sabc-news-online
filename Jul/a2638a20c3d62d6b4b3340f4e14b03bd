A discussion was underway at the District Six Museum in Cape Town to mark Mandela Day on Thursday morning. Madiba’s legacy and economic issues that South Africans are facing were discussed. Issues being discussed at on Thursday morning’s debate include land restitution, land distribution, and reconciliation after the south African first democratic elections of 1994. Panelists from all walks of life are having their say on Mandela day. The long process district six claimants, who were forcefully removed in the area during apartheid, have gone through to return to the area, has also been highlighted, while one of the panellists has called for reparations to be paid to all the people who suffered under apartheid.” Click on the video below:
