The Hawks are hoping to make a breakthrough in their investigation into VBS Mutual Bank after they raided and seized documents and computer hard drives at the Free State Development Corporation (FDC) in Bloemfontein on Friday. The FDC has recently been in the news following allegations that they received 104 million rand from the VBS mutual bank. The bank illegally took deposits from municipalities and other entities before it was looted and rendered bankrupt. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says they hope their investigation will lead to arrests… ” It relates to the VBS ongoing investigation. There were some documents, gadgets… that we needed to seize… and were successfully taken by the team. They are now going to be analysed, and based on what we get, it will be included in our docket. Due to the length taken, we want to make sure the matter is dealt with as soon as possible.”
