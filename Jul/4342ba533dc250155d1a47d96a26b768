The case against the four men accused of killing former ANC Youth League secretary-general, Sindiso Magaqa at Umzimkhulu south of KwaZulu-Natal, has been referred to the High Court. The State is expected to announce the trial date on Thursday as well as in which High Court the four will stand trial. In a letter handed to the Umzimkhulu Regional Court in KwaZulu-Natal, the office of the province’s director of public prosecution says it has decided that the case will no longer be tried in a regional court. The four accused – Sibusiso Ncengwa, Sbonelo Myeza, Mbulelo Mpofana and Mlungisi Ncalane face one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. It is alleged that the four orchestrated the murder of Magaqa. On the day he was attacked, two female councillors were also injured. All four accused were denied bail. On Thursday the court will hear which High Court the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided on for the trial. Related video click below:
