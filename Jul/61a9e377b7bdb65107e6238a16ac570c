The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State says it welcomes the Economic Freedom Fighters‘ (EFF) call for a commission of inquiry into alleged corruption in the province. However, the ANC wants that Commission to investigate corruption throughout the country. The EFF has called for the investigation to extend to municipalities and provincial departments. It says it is seeking legal advice about the reinstatement of fraud and corruption cases that have been taking place since 1994. “If there has to be a commission on corruption and money-laundering in the province, that commission on liquidations must then be country-wide, so that it also includes the allegations that have been entitled (sic) around VBS and the allegations of certain individuals, their involvement in the collapse of VBS. The ANC in the province will continues to indicate that we are fully supporting and co-operating and we have urged everybody in the province to do so in cooperation with State Capture Commission,” says ANC Provincial Spokesperson, Thabo Meeko.
