The Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola says work is under way to make Land Claims Courts a permanent feature with their own judges. He says they also want to broaden the courts’ mandate to deal with all land-related matters including current debates surrounding land expropriation without compensation. Lamola says his department is drafting a bill which will seeks to broaden the mandate of the current land claims courts. “We need to first attend to the issue of the legislation.  As I said, the current system was meant to be transitional and a temporary arrangement. So we need to create legislation that will create permanency,” adds the minister.
