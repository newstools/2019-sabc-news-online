Stormy weather has caused some serious damage in a number of areas across the Western Cape.
Mopping up operations are under way after two cold fronts hit the province this week. The City of Cape Town says more than 170 incidents which include power outages, structural damage or fallen trees have been reported after two intense cold fronts made landfall in the Mother City, bringing with them heavy downpours and gale force winds.  ‘Affected communities’ Around 3 600 dwellings in informal settlements have also been affected by the adverse weather conditions. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says blockages in the city’s stormwater system have emerged as one of the biggest concerns. “The situation will change as repair teams make their way through the list of reported incidents. We ask that residents please bear with us as assessments have to be completed for purpose of record before assistance like flood kits can be provided. The City did make emergency shelter available to the affected communities however these offers have not been accepted. We have also informed Sassa around the need for humanitarian relief.”  Sutherland in thick blanket of snow Meanwhile, Sutherland in the Northern Cape is still blanketed in snow, as the weather service warned that low temperatures are expected to last until Friday. Residents in the area say wind of up to 60 km per hour is making it even colder. Another cold front is expected next week on Tuesday. Snow started falling in the Karoo town on Tuesday as temperatures plummeted to below zero. A thick blanket of snow is visible over much of the rural area, in some areas the snow is as thick as 20 cm. It will be a welcome relief for farmers in the area when the snow melts. They’ve been battling a crippling drought for the past five years. Guesthouse owners in the town say they are inundated with calls for accommodation as people flock to the area to experience the snow.  -Additional reporting by Vanessa Poonah
