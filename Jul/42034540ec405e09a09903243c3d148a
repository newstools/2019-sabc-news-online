Deputy President David Mabuza says government is set to deploy intervention teams to all the country’s ailing municipalities. They will assist with administration and financial management. This follows the recent damning report on municipalities by the Auditor-General. According to the Auditor-General, of the 257 audited municipalities, only 18 received clean audits.
Irregular expenditure stood at a staggering R25.2 billion. Mabuza was giving oral replies to legislators’ questions in parliament on Thursday.  Alex Renewal Project Mabuza says national government will work with all stakeholders to get to the bottom of what happened to the Alexander Renewal Project. He says government is very concerned about the issue. There are allegations that more than R1.6 billion earmarked for the project had been stolen. Responding to a supplementary question from DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen on municipalities that have been designated as a service delivery hotspots, Mabuza says government is determined to ensure that the living conditions of the people of Alexander are improved. “We’ll find out what happens because before dealing with the problem we’re going to get the history of that project. But we can promise the people of Alexander that as government, we are going to coordinate our efforts regardless of our party affiliation. We’re going to work with the DA to deliver, to build those houses to make Alexander a better place to live in,” says Mabuza. Watch Mabuza Q&A at National Assembly:
