The PIC Commission of Inquiry continues. Former CEO, Dan Matjila has claimed at the Commission of Inquiry into the PIC in Pretoria that he has become a scapegoat regarding the controversial PIC- Ayo Technology Solution transaction. In 2017, the PIC invested R4.3 billion into Iqbal Surveâ€™s Ayo Technology Solutions. Matjila has denied almost all allegations leveled against him by senior PIC staff and other executives. He claims due diligence was done and he did not put anyone at the PIC under pressure to push through the Ayo-PIC deal.
