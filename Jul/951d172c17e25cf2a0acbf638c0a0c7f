The United States has twice blocked attempts by three members of the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) to issue a statement condemning the demolition by Israel of Palestinian residential building in East Jerusalem. Israel earlier indicated that the demolished apartment buildings had been built illegally and posed a security threat to the military operating near the wall of separation that runs through the occupied West Bank. South Africa, Indonesia and Kuwait tried to win the approval of all 15 members of the Council in condemning the Israeli action but could not persuade the United States that has long argued against UN bias against Israel. The draft statement expressed the Council’s grave concern about the serious consequences of the demolitions, in particular, the displacement of Palestinian families, its illegality under international law and warned that the policy undermined the viability of a two-state solution. Israel has defended the move as falling with the parameters of their domestic laws after a decision by the country’s Supreme Court cleared the way for the demolitions to take place. Council statements have to be agreed through consensus.
