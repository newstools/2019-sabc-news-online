One of the intended beneficiaries of the Estina Dairy farm Project Ephraim Dhlamini has spoken of alleged death threats due to the project. Dhlamini is testifying for a second day at the Commission of inquiry into state capture. He has told the Commission through an interpreter that he has received death threats because he’s been vocal about the controversial Dairy Project. “In the video that I made mention of, there is a person there that is saying they have hired a killer or someone to kill me. In the video there is a person who is saying Mr. Dhlamini must be killed and then this person heard about this threat and then he said give me this job, I will do it, and then this person then responded by saying, its ok, I will arrange a meeting between yourself and the people who want this person to be killed.” Dlhamini says that it is widely known in Vrede that any mention of former Agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane and the Vrede Diary Project will put one’s life at risk. “If in Vrede you have spoken about the dairy project or Mosebenzi Zwane you won’t sleep in your house. You will have to run away from your house or they will run after you and threaten to kill you. The reason why this issue is before the commission it was because of myself and Mr. Ncongwane, we had to brave ourselves and come before the commission and report before everyone is killed.” Click on the videos below:
