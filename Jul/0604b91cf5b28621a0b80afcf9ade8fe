The State Capture Commission in Johannesburg will on Tuesday hear evidence from former Transport Minister Ben Martins. Former South African Airways (SAA) Human Resources general manager Mathulwane Emily Mpshe told Deputy Chief justice Raymond Zondo yesterday that she was given instructions by former board chair Dudu Myeni and her colleague Yakhe Kwinana on who to hire, suspend and dismiss at the national carrier. Mpshe said there was total disregard for procedures and policies. She also added that forensic investigating companies were used by Myeni as a tool to discredit certain SAA employees who refused to toe the line. The former SAA Human Resources general manager, who concluded her testimony, says she was dismissed without a disciplinary hearing but reached a mutual agreement with management. “The pain and the hardship that I had to endure and my family had to endure is immeasurable. Earlier on, you said I was suspended with pay, yes but it cannot even measure to the pain and hardship that I had to endure,” says Mpshe. “And also my reputation is damaged. If you Google my name right now you will find a statement from SAA saying that Thuli Mpshe was suspended on allegations of serious misconduct  and it is still there, people and potential employers still look at that SAA statement,” explains Mpshe.
