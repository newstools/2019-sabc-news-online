The Western Cape Health Department’s Chronic Dispensary Unit in Parow, Cape Town, is using cutting-edge technology to ensure patients receive their medication without having to wait in queues. In a contract between Western Cape Government Health and Medipost Pharmacy, the Unit has been equipped with an automated chronic medicine dispensing, sorting and parcel assembly line. It’s the first such line that’s operational in the Southern Hemisphere. Department spokesperson, Mark van den Heever, says the CDU dispatches almost 400 000  medicine parcels a month. “What the CDU service means is that instead of people having to wait in long queues for their parcels at pharmacies and facilities, these packages are pre-packed, they get a notified date in terms of when they need to collect the medication and then they get prompted to collect it at their nearest facility, which makes their lives a bit easier, instead of having to wait such a long time in such long queues at our facilities.”
