Small scale farmers at Phalarabora in Limpopo say a newly launched packhouse at Letsitele will help them generate revenue. The Masalal Packhouse has been handed over to the farmers by the Department of Agriculture. Farmers say a lack of a packhouse for different agricultural goods prevented them from accessing markets. One of the farmers, Norah Mlobodzi says they’ll be able to employ more workers. “Because this area is very hot, we did not have much in returns, but after they have erected these shade nets; we see a very big difference. We are getting much in returns other than before and the employment is good because, for the first time, now we could employ 13 permanent workers and eight casual workers.” The Head of Department at the Limpopo Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ramatsimele Maisele, says citrus from the packhouse will be destined for export markets. “This packhouse is actually the global gap certified; which means that the citrus that is going to be processed through this packhouse, is going to be for the export market. So far as we are speaking, they have already packed about 6500 tons of the grape fruit in particular. That is part of the consignment that is destined for China. So we are actually expecting a lot from this packhouse.”
