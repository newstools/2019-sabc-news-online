The Communications Workers Union (CWU) says it will be meeting with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)  board and Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams to give input on a turnaround strategy for the Public Broadcaster. National Treasury rejected the SABC’s initial turnaround strategy. The Public Broadcaster is now working on a new plan with the support of the Minister. CWU Secretary-General Aubrey Tshabalala says the current funding model for the SABC is not effective. “This coming week on Wednesday we are going to meet at what we call a turnaround strategy workshop where we as labour we want to make significant inputs. Amongst those is job retention but also create jobs. We look at the SABC not as a platform to be a champion of retrenchments but to be a platform of creating quality sustainable jobs. The funding model of the SABC is not working. We need to look at new ways.” Tshabalala says the union is continuing to interact with the SABC and all stakeholders. Click below for more on the story:
