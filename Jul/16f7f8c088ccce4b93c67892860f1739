Cancer patients in Mpumalanga have welcomed the opening of the first ever Oncology unit in the province. The Oncology unit is being opened at the Rob Ferreira hospital in Mbombela. Previously, patients from the province had to travel to other provinces for treatment. The patients say the new facility will bring financial and traveling relief. Lindiwe Ntuli-Tloubatla has been diagnosed with six types of cancer since 2000. In 2018 she was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the spinal cord. She is currently undergoing treatment. “We are so proud of our government for taking this initiative. We say big up to Mpumalanga, as you see I am in hospital.  I have been here since Friday in and out its very difficult for me at the moment, but when you said you wanted to interview about cancer, I said it’s for a greater good, it’s for the people out there.” WATCH BELOW:
