The High Court in Johannesburg has approved a historic R5 billion settlement in the silicosis case. The legal process involved gold miners affected by lung diseases since 1965. Claimants will be paid out between R70 000 and R500 000 each. The six mining companies paying out are African Rainbow Minerals‚ Anglo American SA‚ AngloGold Ashanti‚ Gold Fields‚ Harmony and Sibanye Stillwater. They admitted that they failed to take the necessary precautions to protect their employees in the past. Lawyer Richard Spoor represented the miners and the dependents of the deceased. “We had a long hearing where people…Today (Friday) the court ruled that the settlement agreement is fair…this means the settlement is confirmed… start compensating workers.”
