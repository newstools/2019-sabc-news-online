The Nelson Mandela Foundation has urged all South Africans to play their role in eradicating poverty. The theme of this year’s Mandela Day event is: “The eradication of poverty”. The foundation is hosting its annual Mandela Day event at the Germiston Civic Centre in Ekurhurleni. This year, the foundation is working with the City of Ekurhuleni to support four local causes that represent – shelter, education, food and nutrition and active citizenship. The foundation’s CEO Sello Hatang says, “On this Mandela Day, we are saying take action against poverty. Each one of us must play our part in terms of ensuring we break the back of intergenerational poverty and to all the listeners out there, we are saying go out of your way to help build a country of our dreams. Madiba said the world remains with so much poverty, human suffering and inequality and it’s in your hands to have the country of your dreams. It’s about dreaming, you go out and act on that dream.” The day will also include a moment to honour senior citizens and tracking Madiba’s footprints in the City of Ekurhuleni. Meanwhile, over the weekend the foundation in partnership with the Imbumba Foundation sent off the 2019 Trek4Mandela Expedition team at OR Tambo International Airport. The expedition team aims to summit Mount Kilimanjaro to celebrate Mandela Day. Click video below on that ‘Tata’ means to the world:
