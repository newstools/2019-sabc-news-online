The Human Rights Commission says it is appalled by the discovery of expired food and medication at the Musina hospital in Limpopo. Head of the commission, Advocate Bongani Majola, says they also found that the Musina hospital is unhygienic and dirty. Majola and the provincial commissioner, Victor Mavhidula, have been inspecting the conditions at the Musina, Siloam and Tshilidzini hospitals in the province. Majola says the hospitals lack skilled personnel. He also says that patients filing system is manual and not properly managed. “In Musina the shortage of staff was very palpable, many places in the hospital were very dirty, there’s shortage of medication. This is the challenge that again impacts on service delivery to the patients.”
