Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha says municipalities will be under the microscope in the next five years. This follows poor performance by most municipalities in this province. Speaking during the opening of the provincial legislature, Mathabatha says the performance of municipalities remains a worrying factor. Mathabatha says, “The fact that not even a single municipality or municipal entity in this Province managed to receive clean audit is a matter of great concern. Even more worrying is the fact that the number of adverse and disclaimer audit opinion have increased. We simply can no longer proceed in this fashion.” The Premier has urged residents who’re disgruntled with service delivery not to embark on violent protest actions. He says they will spend more than one billion rand on the improvement of road infrastructure across the province this financial year. Some opposition parties in Limpopo have expressed dissatisfaction with plans that Premier  Mathabatha outlined in his state of the province address. EFF leader Jossey Buthana says the people of Limpopo are being taken for a ride. “People of Limpopo have been insulted by Mathabatha to an extreme. He spoke about the new dawn as if he is a new person.” He says plans that pertain to rail transportation, refurbishment of school infrastructure and job creation are not financially feasible. Democratic Alliance’s Katlego Phala says, “As the Democratic Alliance, we are partially satisfied and dissatisfied. We are happy with the allocation of R900 million to special schools.” The speech will be debated on Tuesday.
