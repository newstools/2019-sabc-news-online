Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila is to continue his testimony on Wednesday at the commission of Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation. On Tuesday, Matjila testified how changes in the ministers of finance was a challenge to the corporation – and how that several cabinet reshuffles had affected Treasury and the PIC. Matjila has admitted that he was under pressure from politically-connected individuals, influential business people and politicians to do favours for their businesses. He says the Gupta-owned Oakbay was also pressurising him to facilitate the PIC’s investment in the company’s uranium mine.
