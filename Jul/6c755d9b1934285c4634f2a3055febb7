The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to disclose the names of companies and individuals who funded his African National Congress (ANC) Presidential campaign in 2017. This follows Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s finding that he deliberately misled Parliament about the R500 000 donation from Bosasa. Watch Public Protector release report on President Cyril Ramaphosa:  In a statement, the EFF says given the finding that President Ramaphosa violated the Executive Members Ethics Code, the Speaker of Parliament must, as per Mkhwebane’s recommendation, initiate a process to subject him to Parliamentary discipline. The EFF says that disclosure of the names of President Ramaphosa’s campaign funders is key as some of these individuals could go on to benefit from business with the State. The party says it would be a shame if the President applied to review the Public Protector’s report as he personally benefited from tax payers money to become ANC President. The EFF says President Ramaphosa’s reluctance to act on the Public Protectors findings against Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan is due to the fact that he knew he too was implicated in violating the constitution.
