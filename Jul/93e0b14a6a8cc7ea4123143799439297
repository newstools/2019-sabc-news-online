Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says Paul Mashatile‘s decision to sue the party for saying he knows where the money for the Alexandra Renewable Project is, has disappointed him. He told a media contingent gathered at the party’s headquarters in Johannesburg, that the former MEC for Human Settlement in Gauteng, now the African National Congress Treasurer General, has sent his party summons following their statement. Malema says if the money was meant to develop the most disadvantaged communities across the country has disappeared, then the law must then take its course. “When we say we know where the money is, the money has not serviced the people of Alexandra, there are no services for the people of Alexandra with a naked eye; we are told you’re corrupt. Then come to us and say this is what we have done and say this is the road we have done, these are the houses we have built for so much and all of that and get out of it. I thought Paul was bigger than that.” Click below to watch the media briefing :
