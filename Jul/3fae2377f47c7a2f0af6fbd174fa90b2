Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng caucus leader, Solly Msimanga, says the party will give Premier David Makhura until the end of August to deliver a concrete plan on the e-toll issue before taking action against him. Delivering his State of the Province address in Soweto, Monday morning, Makhura said he was determined to ensure that e-tolls are not part of the future of the province. Msimanga says he does not believe that Makhura’s address brought new and effective ideas – compared to his previous addresses. “He should be coming here to tell us what has been done and how they are going to move forward. I have looked at the 2014 speech, I must say that there was very little that has been changed. We are going to expose the ANC government for who they are.” “We are giving the premier until the end of August because everything for him is now 100 days. So by the end of August there is nothing that is concrete on e-tolls we are going to be bringing it and force them to vote for his lies to the people of Gauteng and expose their lies,” Msimanga adds.
