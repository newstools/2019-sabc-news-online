The State Capture Commission in Johannesburg has set the record straight regarding the agreement that secured the continued participation of former President Jacob Zuma – and says no deal was reached to supply Zuma’s team with questions. The Commission said in a statement that areas of interest in a particular witness’s statement will be conveyed to Zuma’s lawyers within the next two weeks. This means that Zuma will be offered the opportunity to supply his version of incidents mentioned by certain witnesses in the form of an affidavit. A time frame for Zuma’s responding affidavits will then be agreed upon by the respective legal teams. For more on this story see the video below:
