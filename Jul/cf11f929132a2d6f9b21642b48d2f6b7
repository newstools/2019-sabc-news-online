The newly appointed Free State MEC for Cooperative Governance, Thembeni Nxangisa, says he wants to change the way municipalities and government departments behave towards the Auditor-General’s office. Nxangisa has called a meeting with all the province’s Chief Financial Officers following auditor general, Kimi Makwetu’s findings that the province failed to adhere to principles and prescripts of his office. None of the Free State municipalities obtained a clean audit. Nxangisa says he is concerned about the latest auditor-general report. “It’s a concern. We are very unhappy about the performance, but we will take charge correcting everything else. Everybody is going to ensure that we have a clean government and we perform well.” “We have to make sure that we fulfil our mandate. Voters have said we must do right; they are giving us the last chance. We want to make sure that we do our best this time.”
