Princess Phumzile Buthelezi has been elected chairperson of the IFP Women’s Brigade. She is the daughter of party president, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi. She was elected at the party’s conference underway in Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Like the national and youth conferences, the last women’s meeting was in 2011. Internal challenges were cited as reasons for the five-year delay. Earlier this afternoon the outgoing Women’s Brigade Chairperson Thembeni kaMadlopha-Mthethwa and Buthelezi both slammed slate politics in the party. Outgoing IFP Women’s Brigade National Chairperson, Thembeni Madlopha-Mthethwa warned delegates at their national conference against factionalism and the use of social media to belittle each others and criticise the party. Madlopha-Mthethwa also warned members against jostling for positions and unhealthy and undemocratic contestation that sows divisions in the organisation.
