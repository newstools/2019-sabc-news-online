Former UK Labour Party MP Peter Hain says President Cyril Ramaphosa needs support from South Africans as he embarks on a process to rebuild the country and improve the economy. Hain, who was part of the anti-apartheid movement, says it will be critical particularly for the ANC to rally behind Ramaphosa. He says it’s sad that this country will only be known for corruption, while more could be done to restore its integrity internationally. “International confidence, including investor confidence, has been at a very low level and the President is doing his best and he needs to be supported. And those who backed [Jacob] Zuma and are still in leading positions in the party, that is senior positions in the party are destroying. If they win and they pull President Ramaphosa down, as they seem to be wanting to do, then the country will not recover very easily.” Click on the related video below:
