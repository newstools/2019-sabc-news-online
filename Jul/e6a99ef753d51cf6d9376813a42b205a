Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Leader Julius Malema says his party has been informed of a plot to assassinate the party’s Deputy President Floyd Shivambu. Malema says the police’s crime intelligence division has given the information to the relevant minister but that he has not acted on it. He told a media briefing in Parliament that the person involved is an Indian hotel owner from KwaZulu-Natal. Malema says, “There is an intelligence report by crime intelligence which confirm that Floyd Shivambu is a subject of target and they even identified the person who procured the killing of Floyd.” “Till today (Thursday) the minister has the report, till today nothing has happened. The assassin went to Floyd. We reported the matter to the minister, crime intelligence has investigated. It is confirmed and they even know the person. The person owns the hotels in Natal,” He adds.
