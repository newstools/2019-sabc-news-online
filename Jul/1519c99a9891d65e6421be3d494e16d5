An Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) branch chairperson in the Western Cape, Xolani Jack (36) has been shot and killed at his house in Thembani, Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats. Jack was gunned down during the early hours of Sunday morning. The area is among those identified for the deployment of the army to help maintain law and order on the Cape Flats. The EFF’s Provincial Chairperson, Melikhaya Xego says they are in shock and do not want to speculate on the motive for the murder. “He was at his home at his flat in Khayelitsha.

Unfortunately, they managed to shoot 14 times and he passed on on the scene,” says Xego. Police spokesperson, Noloyiso Rwexana says no arrests have been made as yet. According to information from police, an unknown man wearing black clothes kicked the door of the deceased flat open and shot the victim several times to his body.
