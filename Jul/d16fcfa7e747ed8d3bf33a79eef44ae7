The ANC’s KwaZulu-Natal provincial offices in Durban have been closed after angry supporters of eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede gathered in front of the building to demand her reinstatement. Earlier some protesters were arrested after they blocked the busy Pixley ka Seme Street, formerly West Street, demanding Gumede’s return to office. Staff and ANC provincial leaders left the offices as the protesters approached. Meanwhile clashes once again broke out between police and supporters of the mayor. Police used rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of protesters who tried go to the Durban Magistrate’s Court where 7 of their colleagues would be appearing. The seven were arrested during Thursday morning’s protests and charged with public violence. A journalist with Independent Media was also arrested and charged with common assault. A case against him was opened by a Metro police officer he is alleged to have assaulted. But he has since been released.  The supporters want the ANC’s national leaders to intervene. The ANC’s provincial executive council in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday extended the mayor’s 30-day leave of absence due to corruption charges against her for a further 30 days. One of the supporters says they want the ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule to address them. “We are here to demand that the national must send one of their own in the form of secretary general comrade Ace Magashule to come and address us. Because we have exhausted every available avenue to speak with the leadership of the province in the form of the PEC. So we are here to demand to them that they facilitate a meeting with the national office bearers.”
