The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the judgment by the High Court in Johannesburg which found former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli and his co-accused Mthunziomhle Mthunzi, guilty of kidnapping and intimidation. Mdluli and Mthunzi were found guilty on four counts of intimidation, two counts of kidnapping, two counts of common assault and two counts of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The case relates to the 1999 murder of Oupa Ramogibe, who allegedly had an affair with Mdluli’s customary wife, Tshidi Buthelezi. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana says the NPA are of the view that the court did its best. “The NPA welcomes the conviction of Mr Mthembeni Mthunzi and Mr Richard Mdluli who were convicted by the Johannesburg High Court today. We are of the view that the court did its best in considering and evaluating evidence in its totality and came to a just conclusion,” says Mjonondwana. Watch the unpacking of Mdluli case:
