Constitutional law expert, Shadrack Gutto, says Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s latest report on President Cyril Ramaphosa should be welcomed as the Constitution requires transparency, accountability and openness. This follows Mkhwebane’s announcement on Friday that she found Ramaphosa had deliberately misled Parliament about the 2017 Bosasa donation. The R500 000 campaign donation was made to Ramaphosa’s son, Andile, by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. SlideShare Last November, Ramaphosa told parliament that the money was obtained legally for the services his son provided, but he later said the payment was a donation towards his campaign. Mkhwebane says she has referred money-laundering allegations to the NPA to conduct investigations on the matter. In a statement, the presidency has described as unfortunate Mkhwebane’s findings saying the public protector has failed to properly consider Ramaphosa’s submissions regarding the donation. Gutto has raised questions on Ramaphosa’s decision not to openly reveal information on the donation. He says, “I think what the Public Protector said should be welcomed. It’s a question of once you are elected or during your campaign, how do you get donations for your own funding and that of your political party because that is for declaration.” “The constitution requires transparency, accountability and openness. This report is narrowing down the question of corruption, money laundering and so on.”
