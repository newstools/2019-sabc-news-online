Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga joins Katlehong community in doing her 67 minutes of Mandela Day service in Katlehong Primary School to honour former statesman Nelson Mandela. On Saturday, the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT) together with the Minister start a cleaning campaign at Katlehong Primary School, east of Johannesburg, as part of Mandela Month. “Public schools are our schools,” says the Minister who will visit 10 schools in the area.  Katlehong Primary School  was recently torched in an alleged arson attack after community service delivery protests. The CEO of NECT, Godwin Khosa says the project will allow community members to contribute to the up-keeping of schools. “Public schools belong to the people and we’re mobilising people from around these schools to come in and clean up the schools and in that manner, they’ll get a sense of what happens in the schools and hopefully, learn to appreciate a little more of the value of the schools and that the schools belong to them,” says Khosa.
