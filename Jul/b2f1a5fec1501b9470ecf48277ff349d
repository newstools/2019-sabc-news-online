The SANDF has been deployed to the Cape Flats on Thursday. Heavily armed troops, accompanied the SAPS, conducted stop and searches and patrols in the area. Kicking off in Manemberg, troops stood guard as police officers stopped and searched taxis and private vehicles. A young boy was found carrying a knife. Some residents are not happy with these searches. They say that the army should not treat them like criminals and should go where the gangsters are. In Hanover Park, a convoy of soldiers stopped at a block of flats. Upon their arrival, community members cheered loudly. The troops conducted raids and one person was seen taken away in handcuffs. Residents say that they are happy the army has come, but it is when they leave that the trouble will start. The deployment comes a week after Police Minister Bheki Cele made the announcement in Parliament. Itâ€™s still unclear what exactly the deployment will entail as both the ministries of police and defence are keeping mum. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
