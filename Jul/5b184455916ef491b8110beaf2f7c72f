A 26-year-old man has been arrested for attempted murder, following a shootout with police at a residential complex in Douglasdale, Sandton, north of Johannesburg. The shootout ensued after police were called to the scene where the suspect threatened security guards at gunpoint, trying to force them to allow him into the complex. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the suspect was on the run after he allegedly shot a taxi driver in Leratong, west of Johannesburg. “When he was arrested it was found that he had three unlicensed firearms in his possession. A shotgun and two pistols and also about 13 magazines for different firearms were found and also three rifle magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, of R5 and 9mm.”
