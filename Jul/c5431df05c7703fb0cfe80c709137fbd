The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State says it’s seeking legal advice on the reinstatement of fraud and corruption cases that have taken place since 1994. Provincial Party Chairperson, Mandisa Makheseni says the EFF will also launch a fraud and corruption hotline for communities. The party has called on the provincial government to establish a commission of inquiry into in municipalities and provincial departments. “Those people today, they are members of the Parliament. They were doing wrong things. We are just asking legal services … they must advise us and give us direction (on) how to deal with those cases because those people, they are occupying serious positions without anything. Those cases, they must be reinstated because now it’s 10 years ago … 20 years ago this thing happened. There’s no accountability of what happened with those cases,” explains Makheseni. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) says it does not support the idea of having commission of inquiry in the province. “The reason why we are not supporting the provincial commission of inquiry is because it empowers the provincial premier to be the one to constitute the panel to sit on that commission. So, as a result, you will be reporting to the very same people who are also captured. So, that’s why we don’t support the provincial commission of inquiry. We’d rather the Judge Zondo Commission because we believe that is the only way that you’re going to get to the bottom of each and everything, because currently (as) I’m speaking and municipalities are failing. There’s no finance. There’s (no) service delivery. There’s a collapse of everything in the Free State. So, the Judge Zondo Commission is the one we are hoping for,” says Provincial Party leader, Patricia Kopane.
