The trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Sulani in the Port Elizabeth High Court has been postponed to Wednesday. The accused face a total of 97 charges that include alleged rape, human trafficking, racketeering and sexual assault. Omotoso’s defence lawyer Peter Dauberman said he would argue facts in the charge sheet. Dauberman who addressed newly appointed judge Irma Schoeman said the charge sheet was riddled with inaccuracies. He filed an application regarding this and was furnished with detail, but said the defence needs more particulars. Judge Mandela Makaula recused himself from the initial trial after it was revealed that his wife owned a guesthouse, where some state witnesses had been accommodated. Omotoso’s legal team claimed that Makaula was biased towards first witness, Cheryl Zondi and overly sympathetic. Daubermann approached the Constitutional Court and filed an application for Makaula to recuse himself after the Supreme Court of Appeal rejected his application. On Tuesday, there was a strong presence of Omotoso supporters outside court. Strict security measures have been enforced however, and only a limited number of people were allowed in court. Omotoso will remain in custody and his two co-accused are out on bail. Watch related video:
