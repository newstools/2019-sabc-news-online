The African National Congress (ANC) has expressed concern about the public spat on Twitter, between Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Gauteng Premier David Makhura on e-tolls. Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says the issue of communication between members who are deployed in government needs urgent intervention. He says at the next ANC National Executive Committee meeting, Mboweni and Makhura will be discussed and  proper action will be taken if any of them are found to have violated party policies and conduct. “We are quite concerned with how our own members including those deployed in positions of responsibility are using some media platforms.” “We need to remind members of the ANC about the communication protocol which guide and govern the conduct of our members including those in government – social media, especially Twitter or Facebook. These are not the right platforms to vent issues of concern, including where there are policy disagreement,” adds Mabe.   So, when you invest in a toll road infrastructure, you expect a return for many years ahead as per contract. Right? Not the cost of your investment today. Future returns. That is what you do in business. Premier Makhura, correct?
