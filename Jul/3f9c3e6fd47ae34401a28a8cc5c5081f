The presidency says President Cyril Ramaphosa will study Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s report and decide on any further decisions, after the report made adverse findings against him over a R500 000 campaign donation from Bosasa. Mkhwebane on Friday announced that she has found that Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament about the 2017 Bosasa donation. She says she has referred money-laundering allegations to the National Prosecuting Authority to conduct investigations on the matter. In a statement, the presidency has described as unfortunate Mkhwebane’s findings, saying the Public Protector has failed to properly consider Ramaphosa’s submissions regarding the donation. Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko says Ramaphosa submitted a substantial response to Mkhwebane’s preliminary findings in late June, saying they were deficient in both fact and law.
