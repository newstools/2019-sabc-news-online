Ordinary South Africans have been urged to play an active role in fighting corruption instead of leaving it to law enforcement agencies. The call was made by the deputy president of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers (NADEL), Lawrence Manyi. He spoke at a conference on the “Negative Impact of Corruption on the Enjoyment of Human Rights” at the Free State University. The Zondo Commission, Nugent Commission, as well as the PIC Inquiry, are some of government initiatives to root out corruption. NADEL believes ordinary South Africans also have a role to play. Manyi says: “We can stop by taking bribes; we can stop buying stolen goods. We can of course report any officials soliciting bribes.” The Free State has seen its fair share of community uprisings in recent months. This includes Maluti-A-Phofung residents wanting to remove then mayor Vusi Tshabalala. They accused him of corruption. The Human Rights Commission (HRC) says corruption has crippled service delivery in the province. HRC Provincial Manager Thabang Kheswa says:”Corruption is the biggest threat to democracy. It undermines the commitment to the promotion, protection and advancement of human rights. It limits the state’s ability to fulfill its human rights obligations to deliver basic services like healthcare, education, social services and many other services.” Human Rights Activist Krish Govender says:”Definitely when you’re working in government, I will tell you about how difficult it is to deal with corrupt elements around you because you are the first target and it’s not easy to defend yourself.” Govender says legislation meant to protect whistle-blowers is inadequate.
