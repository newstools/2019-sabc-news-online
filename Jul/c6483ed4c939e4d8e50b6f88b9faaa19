Relatives of 40 Life Esidimeni patients, who survived the unlawful transfer to NGOs, have expressed dissatisfaction that not all compensation claims have been paid. Some claim that they have only received 50% of the stipulated amount. About 300 families represented by the Life Esidimeni Tragedy Committee have accused Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s office of breaking an agreement to not place the money into a trust. Committee member, Christine Nxumalo, details their concerns, “The new claimants of a lot of the family members are still alive. There was a bit of an issue in paying out all the money and not making sure that the patients are actually catered for. “We as the family committee are very frustrated at the process because what had happened is that families who were verified even before the payment process started are now no longer qualified. So we say we cannot be a part of this anymore. We are afraid that a lot of things are potentially going to go wrong and we have raised our issues and said we have concerns now,” Nxumalo argues.
