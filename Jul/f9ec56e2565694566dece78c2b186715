Former Justice Department Director-General, Nonkululeko Sindane, is to testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Wednesday. She was on a panel that exonerated former President Jacob Zuma of any responsibility in the Gupta Waterkloof Airport scandal. On Tuesday, the commission heard from former Transport Minister Ben Martins and Chief of Air Traffic Navigation Services Hennie Marais about the details surrounding the saga. In his brief testimony, Martins said that he did not attend a Gupta wedding at Sun City in 2013 because the Justice Security Cluster committee had met and advised ministers against attending. Sindane, who at the time was Director-General in the Justice Department under Minister Jeff Radebe, is expected to provide comprehensive evidence on matter. Watch a related video below:
