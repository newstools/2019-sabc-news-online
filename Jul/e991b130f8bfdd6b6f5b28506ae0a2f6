The family of a 34-year-old man, accused of attempting to kill two homeless men at Muckluneck Park in Pretoria, has broken its silence. Malusi Mothupi was arrested in June, following a wave of attacks and murders of homeless men in the area. He appeared briefly in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on two counts of attempted murder. Mothupi has been remanded in custody until the 30th of July for further police investigations. He has also abandoned his bail application. Police have since identified three of the five murdered homeless men. Mothupi’s brother, Oupa, told the media outside the court that his relative’s rights had been violated. “Totally, totally. Like I said, he was not allowed to make calls to inform us of that situation or to be seen. And when we tried to find out, the police said he has stabbed and killed. So, even now we don’t know what his case is. So, regarding the manner in which the case was handled we are totally not satisfied.” Watch a related video below:
