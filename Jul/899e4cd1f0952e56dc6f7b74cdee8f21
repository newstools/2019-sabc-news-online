The trial of Fees Must Fall activist, Mcebo Dlamini, has been set down for November 12. During pre-trial discussions in court on Monday, the state said it intended to call over a dozen witnesses. Some from provinces outside Gauteng and one from Pakistan. Dlamini was arrested in October 2016 following protests for free education. Dlamini is facing a string of charges including public violence, assault, theft and malicious damage to property. Speaking after the short appearance, Dlamini also expressed disappointment that the case was not dropped. “We are disputing all the charges against us. And we are going for trial in November. We are for and ready for trial. I hope the matter will be finalised as soon as possible because my legal career depends on the outcome of this matter. As I stand, I don’t know whether I’ll be an advocate this time next year. All depends on the judgement because if I’m found guilty it means all the years that I have spent at the university will be useless,” said Dlamini. Watch related video below:
