Police are investigating an incident in which the office of Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba was broken into and important documents taken. This comes after a government official who allegedly stole files relating to the investigation of the controversial R1.3 billion Alexandra Renewal Project returned the documents. Mashaba said the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements employee returned three documents and meeting attendance registers. He did not name the official. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar explains, “How he entered the building and how the suspect was able to get out is not yet clear. We can confirm that there is damage to the glass door and a wooden door to the offices. We can see the intruder changed, however, we can see his face very clearly. He was walking out of the office with a backpack.”
