Police have been deployed to monitor the situation in Mathole and Doornkop west of Johannesburg following Tuesday’s protests. Residents of Mathole blocked Main Reef Road near Leratong Hospital while communities in Doornkop staged a protest on Impala Road that links the hospital with Protea, causing serious traffic congestion. It is believed that the protests were over electricity related issues. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the roads are open to traffic on Wednesday morning. “I’m standing here at Leratong where police have been deployed since yesterday [Tuesday].  Also in Emndeni link on Impala Road, the roads are clear; police are still deployed there to monitor the situation. No one was arrested but what we know is that community members went to Eskom earlier on but we don’t know what the outcome of their meeting was,” explains Makhubele.
