The Democratic Alliance (DA) has given the assurance that its current rift with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Tshwane will not hamper service delivery in the region. EFF leader Julius Malema on Tuesday said his party will no longer vote with the DA or African National Congress (ANC) across all municipalities. A DA-led coalition currently governs Tshwane, but it relies on the EFF to pass matters in council. The EFF had given the DA in the Tshwane Metro an ultimatum to make way for an EFF person to become the Mayor in the Metro by June. The DA’s Chairperson for the Federal Council, James Selfe, says they will continue to foster good working relations with the EFF. Selfe says, “Generally speaking, the arrangement worked well, we had a good relationship with the people from the EFF locally, but this I suspect is perpetuated by different considerations on a national level. Happily the budget has already been passed so the money is available for the programmes and there’s nothing that would impede service delivery particularly. So we’ll just have to see how the relationship develops over time. We will have to seek as before support on an issue by issue basis.” Watch a related video below:
