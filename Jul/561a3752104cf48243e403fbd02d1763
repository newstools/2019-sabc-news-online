Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has reportedly instructed Treasury Director-General (DG) Dondo Mogajane to look at ways of funding the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) using cash from the contingency reserve. Mboweni is reported to have declined to give the cash-strapped public broadcaster a much-needed government guarantee. News website, Times Live reports that Mboweni relayed his decision in a letter to Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams in late June. Mboweni reportedly cites government’s fiscal constraints, concerns over the SABC’s financial viability, including its salary bill as the reason for not giving the guarantee. Times Live journalist Mpumzi Zuzile wrote the article. Mboweni said the DG must come up with a plan of how they are going to assist the SABC within the prescribed government budgeting.
