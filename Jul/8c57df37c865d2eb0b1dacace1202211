Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has highlighted the importance of ethical leadership. He was delivering the keynote address at the 67-Minutes Leadership Talk hosted by the People Matter Foundation in Kempton Park. Mogoeng says South Africans have suffered enough in the past 25 years because of some of their leaders have put money and positions first. “Many are prepared to kill for money, and even for positions… to lie their way into wealth and positions of influence but what Mandela like idea are you prepared to die for. Let us move away from saying what we are expected to see.”
