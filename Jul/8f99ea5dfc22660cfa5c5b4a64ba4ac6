Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says government will ensure that Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans also benefit in every major government housing project. Sisulu was speaking during the official hand over of about 500 title deeds to the beneficiaries of the Cornubia Housing Project north of Durban, on Friday. Amongst the beneficiaries were 20 MK veterans. Sisulu says government owes the MK veterans recognition for their role in the liberation struggle. “In every human settlement project of this nature, of this size, we have tried to make sure that part of this integration,  we are going to make sure that for every one of them there is a certain portion allocated to soldiers. This is what we owe them, they fought for this country. These are the military veterans and they may have not been able to get anything out of government.” One of the MK veterans, who have benefited from the project, Mbongeni Dube says, “This is evidence that we are now being taken care of. As military veterans, we are promising that we will protect the community of Cornubia and we will ensure that the community also benefit other basic needs.”
