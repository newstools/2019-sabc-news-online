Political Analyst Dirk Kotzé has described the judgment by the High Court in Pretoria in favour of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan as a major setback for Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The court has suspended the Public Protector’s remedial action against Gordhan, pending a judicial review in the South African Revenue Service (SARS) ‘rogue unit’ matter. Mkhwebane found that Gordhan’s establishment of the so-called ‘rogue unit’, while he was still SARS Commissioner in 2007, was a violation of the Constitution. Gordhan brought the urgent application to interdict Mkhwebane’s findings, until the judicial review has been concluded. Kotzé has described the ruling as a positive one for President Cyril Ramaphosa.
