The African National Congress (ANC) in the Mangaung region is demanding that Mangaung Metro Executive Mayor Olly Mlamleli be recalled. Acting Regional Secretary, Lulama Titi says they wrote a letter to the Free State Provincial Executive Committee stating their dissatisfaction with Mlamleli over a lack of service delivery. Titi says areas such as waste management and a lack of major projects that a metro is supposed to undertake are some of the things that they are unhappy about.
