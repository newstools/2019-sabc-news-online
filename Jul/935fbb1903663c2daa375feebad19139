Members of the Eastern Cape legislature and provincial government employees will be subjected to lifestyle audits this financial year. The audits will commence as soon as the legislature finds an independent auditor to carry out the work. The Speaker of the Legislature, Helen Sauls-August says the move will go a long way in tackling corrupt activities. “The first person we must start with is myself and my co-staff. We need to get rid of this cloud hanging over our heads as strategic deployees. There is always something untoward happening in our offices and around ourselves. It is befitting that I start with myself. Obviously, we are going to speedily look for a company. Basically, it must be outsourced. We can’t oversight ourselves.” Opposition parties have welcomed the move. The DA’s Nqaba Banga says that the Premier must be the first person to undergo an audit. “This thing of personal audits, we are 100% behind it. The Premier must be the first person to be audited.” Banga of the DA, the EFF’s Zoleka Qotoyi and Veliswa Mvenya of the ATM, have welcomed the move. The EFF’s  Qotoyi says those guilty of criminal activities must be arrested. “The legislature is supposed to arrest the criminals who have been stealing the money for the past 25 years. We welcome the move by the Speaker and we are hoping that we are going to get the reports.”
