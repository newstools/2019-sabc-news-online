The Minister of Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, has welcomed the judgement by the High Court in Pretoria which granted his urgent application and suspended the Public Protector’s remedial action against him, pending a judicial review in the so-called South African Revenue Service (SARS) ‘Rogue Unit’ matter. Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, found that Gordhan’s establishment of the so-called Rogue Unit while he was still Commissioner of the Revenue Service in 2007, was a violation of the Constitution. “We are pleased with the judgement. Our hand was forced to go to court in the sense that there were dates which were expiring in respect of what the PP must do, what the President must do, what the State Security minister must do. We had to approach the court on an urgent basis, so we’re pleased in the sense that all of that is suspended, pending a proper ventilation of the issues which we say we’re right about and which the PP says we wrong about. So, that court process will unfold in due course,” says Gordhan’s lawyer Tebogo Malatji. Watch a related video below:
