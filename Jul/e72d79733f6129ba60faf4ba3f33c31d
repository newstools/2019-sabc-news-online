Residents of the late former President Nelson Mandela’s hometown, Qunu, Eastern Cape, says since the death of the struggle icon in 2013, their living conditions have worsened. Despite facing many challenges including service delivery, they’ll celebrate his birthday on Thursday. Their complaints include the delay in renovating the museum in the town. A number of them say the museum was built to fight poverty and unemployment. “It’s tough now that Mandela died. We no longer get anything. Long ago, we had Christmas with him. The museum is now closed. We have no idea what to do. There are no jobs,” says one resident. “We have no water. We drink with cows,” adds another resident. Local chief Nokwanele Balizulu says Mandela’s dream for a better life for all has been abandoned. “You can see it’s tough and there is no longer respect for Dalibunga. The crime here is high. Trucks are being hijacked here. At his gate, we go out with our blankets to cover dead people who have been shot. Imagine that. His spirit and ideology has deteriorated (sic).”
