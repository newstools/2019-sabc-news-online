Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says the African National Congress (ANC) is using the Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) to get rid of the ANC National Executive Committee member Derek Hanekom. The ANC is holding its regular National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting this weekend amid deepening tensions in the governing party. The two-day meeting in Irene, outside Pretoria, comes at a time when some NEC members are said to have conspired with some opposition parties to oust the then President Jacob Zuma and divisions on whether to support the current Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane or not. Mathekga says Hanekom is being unjustifiably singled out. “The wind was blowing in a manner that some members of the ANC wanted to remove Zuma. They could use whatever options that they wanted to be able to do that. That is why Hanekom is not ashamed of being associated with the idea of removing Zuma. What they are trying to blame him for is to isolate him, make this appear like it is a clandestine manoeuvre. It has been out there in the open that there were efforts to remove Zuma although those efforts were failing but we’ve known about such as intentions within ANC,” says Mathekga.
