Insufficient funding, high vacancy rates and the exodus of senior prosecutors are some of the main problems the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Advocate Shamila Batohi says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is facing. Batohi was briefing Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services on the entity’s plan of action. She says over the past three years about 600 prosecutors have left the NPA. “In the specialised unit where we are really looking at providing services and those who will be your specialised commercialised units, asset forfeiture unit and sexual affairs and community affairs unit. We are sitting between 25 and 28% vacancy rates. And in actual terms we have lost about 600 prosecutors since 2015 because of a freeze on recruitment. So basically we have not been able to recruit since 2015.” WATCH BELOW:
