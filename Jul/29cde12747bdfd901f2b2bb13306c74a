Four people have been killed and at least 12 others are feared trapped under rubble after a building collapsed as heavy monsoon rains lashed India’s financial capital Mumbai. Two teams from India’s National Disaster Response Force, as well as local volunteers, the fire department and police officials are scouring the rubble for survivors. Earlier, the head of the United Nations (UN), Antonio Guterres, said the UN is ready to assist countries in South Asia, where incessant monsoon rains have killed more than 180 people and displaced millions.
