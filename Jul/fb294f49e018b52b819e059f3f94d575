Former Cabinet Minister, Ngoako Ramatlhodi, has reiterated that he will not be taking any legal action against President Jacob Zuma, for now. Zuma started his testimony at the State Capture Commission by claiming that Ramatlhodi was a spy. Last year, Ramatlhodi told the Commission about Zumaâ€™s supposedly toxic relationship with the Guptas and how the former President had mortgaged off the country to the controversial family. Ramatlhodi is adamant that a public lie detector test between him and Zuma will unveil the truth. He spoke to SABC news presenter Stephen Grootes.
