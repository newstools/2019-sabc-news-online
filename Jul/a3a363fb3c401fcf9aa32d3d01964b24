The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has expressed concern over death threats directed at its journalists who are covering various issues across the country, including instances of alleged corruption. SABC News journalists have been receiving threats, including for their reporting on allegations of corruption in Limpopo. The public broadcaster says they are disturbed by recent instances of political and corporate bullying directed at its news service staff, with some of these happening on social media platforms. SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu says the corporation takes these threats seriously. “The SABC takes these threats seriously and wants to put on record that these acts go against the constitutionally guaranteed freedom to perform its duties without hindrance. Where there is evidence of legislative and regulatory contravention or complaints of unfair coverage, the public is encouraged to raise these directly with the SABC, or approach relevant institutions like ICASA, BCCSA, and the PCSA. The SABC is sincerely appealing to the public to give its journalists a safe space to do their work, in a manner that guarantees transparency, accountability and inclusiveness.”
