The Commission of Inquiry into impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) will continue to hear testimony on Tuesday from the corporation’s former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dan Matjila. The commission postponed hearings on Tuesday due to Tshwane bus service employees striking in Pretoria CBD. It was last week granted an extension until the end of October. Matjila is expected to give the sequence of events that led to the PIC giving Ayo Technologies Solution a R4.3 billion funding facility. He will also detail the PIC’s involvement in VBS Mutual Bank, which illegally took deposits from municipalities and was looted, allegedly by politically connected people. The commission has so far heard testimony from 70 witnesses, who have implicated Matjila in wrongdoing. The commission was expected to have wrapped up at the end of April but was granted another extension until the end of July, which it failed to meet. President Cyril Ramaphosa instituted a Commission of Inquiry into the PIC to investigate alleged improprieties with the aim of restoring confidence in the corporation. This will be the fourth week Matjila will continue to give evidence. Watch a related video below:
