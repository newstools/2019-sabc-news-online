Eskom’s Group Treasurer Andre Pillay has become the latest high-profile resignation from the struggling power utility. Eskom has confirmed his resignation, saying he will be leaving at the end of next month. Pillay’s departure follows less than two months after the resignation of Eskom CEO, Phakamani Hadebe. Pillay was appointed Senior Manager for Funding Execution in the Eskom Treasury Department in 2011 and was promoted to his current position in 2016. No reason for his resignation has been provided but Eskom has thanked him for the role that he had played in ensuring that the power utility’s funding plans were successfully executed. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni recently told Parliament that he plans to introduce a Special Appropriation Bill on additional funding for Eskom on the 23rd of this month. However, he was mum on the amount that he’s considering to give the power utility.
