Advocate Jannie Lubbe, the evidence leader of the PIC Commission of Inquiry says a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) lifestyle audit on Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila has not picked up any R2.45 million VBS Mutual Bank loan. Earlier, United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader, Bantu Holomisa who was instrumental in revealing the corruption at the PIC said Matjila should also be investigated over allegations that he unduly benefited from the VBS loan. Advocate Lubbe says the PIC Commission forensic team will follow up and complete their own independent investigation regarding this matter. “I became aware of these allegations a couple of weeks ago when I was informed by the PIC of a forensic report by Nexis stating that there was this alleged facility granted to Dr Matjila at the time PWC was performing a lifestyle audit.” “I established with PWC to see if this is correct and I also informed the legal representatives of Dr Matjila that I had been informed of this. PWC completed this lifestyle audit and they will present this report next week to the commission. I can inform the commission and may this be placed on record that there is no evidence of such a loan,” explains Lubbe. Click below for more…
