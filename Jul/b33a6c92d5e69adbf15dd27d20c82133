Mopping up operations are continuing across Cape Town following two days of heavy rains and gale force winds that have wreaked havoc in parts of the city. Rainfall of up to 99 millimetres has been recorded in some areas and about 3 000 dwellings in informal settlements have been affected. Cape Town has been in the grips of intense cold since Monday. Heavy downpours and gale force winds have been battering the Mother City, resulting in localised flooding and damage to a number of dwellings in informal settlements across the Cape. The strong winds also ripped off parts of the roof of a classroom at Al-Azhar High School in Athlone. The rain water subsequently seeped through the damaged roof, resulting in a pool of water in a classroom. The school’s principal, Ashiek Manie, says learners were left traumatised by the incident. No academic activities are taking place in the classroom on Wednesday, but learning is continuing in the rest of the school.  A coffee vendor in Bloubergstrand says he was terrified when he saw how a gale force wind ripped off parts of the roof of the restaurant where he works. Ben Mushambi says a section of the roof of the restaurant On the Rocks landed in the road on the other side of the property. “The wind that was here, it was very horrible. It actually blew the other side of our roof, it went straight up above and to the next building. It was terrible.”
