 There has been a public exchange of words between the Gauteng local government and the Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni. Since Friday night, Mboweni and Gauteng premier David Makhura, as well as Tasneem Motara, the MEC for Infrastructure Development and Property Management â€“ have taken to Twitter in disagreement over the issue of e-tolls. Mboweni is adamant that road users must pay for e-tolls. On Twitter he posted that Gauteng Premier Makhura must be careful before picking up a fight with the Minister, because he is the one controls allocations, and warning him that he must be careful. Mboweni says he believes the user-pay principle should be effective, while Makhura insists that e-tolls have no future in Gauteng. Meanwhile, on her twitter account, Motara says she had a long conversation with Mboweni who still stood by his position, but says a meeting between himself and the African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) will soon take place, where the issue will be discussed further.    In response to the tweet, David Makhura wrote that he referred the issue of e-tolls to President Cyril Ramaphosa and Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula.
