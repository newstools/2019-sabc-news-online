Police Minister Bheki Cele has visited the family home of the late Senzo Meyiwa in Umlazi, south of Durban, to pay his respects. Sam Meyiwa died at his home on Monday morning after a long illness. He was 67. Meyiwa senior had been vocal calling for justice after his son Senzo Meyiwa was shot and killed at the home of his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo in 2014. Senzoâ€™s father had appealed to authorities to arrest those responsible. Meyiwa senior suffered a stroke last year. His poor health has been attributed to the mysterious killing of his son who was a former Bafana Bafana as well as Orlando Pirates goalkeeper. Five years later, no one has been arrested in connection with the murder of Senzo Meyiwa. Watch video below:
