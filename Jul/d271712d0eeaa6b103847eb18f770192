Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, says 250 000 young people will be placed in long-term jobs in various government sectors. He is delivering his State of the Province Address (SOPA) at the University of Johannesburg’s Soweto Campus. Makhura says the province needs to assist the thousands of unemployed youth by ensuring that jobs are created. “In our province, we have close to two million young people who are looking for these opportunities. We do the following: we will make sure that 250 000 people are brought into long-term employments in key sectors of our economy. In each key sector where jobs are created, half of those jobs must go to young people, including in the township economy. We will also ensure that entry-level jobs of government are used as opportunities to bring in young people so the requirement for experience won’t be there,” says Makhura.
