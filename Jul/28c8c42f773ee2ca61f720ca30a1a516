The Congress of South African Students (Cosas) is concerned about overcrowding in classes and the safety of learners at some schools in the North West. Cosas President John Macheke says ageing infrastructure and a lack of scholar transport are also issues of concern. He was speaking during a march by Cosas members to the education sub-district offices in Makapanstad in the Moretele Local Municipality. “We want to know why there is no fencing in some of the schools in Moretele. We want to know why there are no security guards in schools here in Moretele. We want to know why other schools in Moretele, they are not being granted scholar transport. We want to know why other schools up to so far they still have old sanitation.”
