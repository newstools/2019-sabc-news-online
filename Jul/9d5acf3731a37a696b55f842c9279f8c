The number of Ebola outbreak cases is increasing on a daily basis in the Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s affected zones. More than 2000 people have been infected by the epidemic that has been described as the worst. Ebola has taken too long to be contained in DRC due to insecurity and lack of local community engagement. Earlier in June, the virus claimed two lives in neighbouring Uganda among a family who had travelled to the DRC. Over 140 000 people have been vaccinated in the affected eastern DRC provinces of Ituri and North Kivu, the epicentre of the outbreak. Ebola spreads among humans through close contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person, or objects contaminated by such fluids. Related video click below:
