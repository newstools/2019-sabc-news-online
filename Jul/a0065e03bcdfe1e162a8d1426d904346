Former president, Jacob Zuma, says he has been provoked into spilling the beans about intelligence information that he has. He has told the State Capture Inquiry that he was warned that if former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was removed from cabinet, the rand would tumble. Gordhan was fired by Zuma in 2017 and replaced with Des van Rooyen which precipitated a significant drop in the rand . ” When Rupert saw him he said Minister Mbalula, at that time he was Minister of Sports, if Zuma takes out, removes Gordhan, we will shut down the economy of this country. You must go and tell him we will make the rand flat on the ground, indeed they did interfere with the rand.” Zuma has also alleged that Former Public Service Minister, Ngoako Ramatlodi, who testified at the Commission about his supposedly toxic relationship with the Guptas, was an apartheid era spy who has not changed his ways. Zuma also told the Commission that former ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe and his Deputy Jessie Duarte were happy with his idea that the Gupta family establish the New Age newspaper and the ANN7 TV station. Zuma said this initiative was motivated by the need for fairer media coverage in the country. He says that there is nothing wrong with the family establishing a business and the ANC’s National Executive Committee were fully briefed. Watch video below:
