The State Capture Commission has adjourned until Friday, following disagreements between former President Jacob Zuma‘s legal team and the Commission’s evidence leader. Zuma and his legal counsel earlier threatened to pull out after complaining about the line of questioning by evidence leader Advocate Paul Pretorius. Following a meeting in chambers, Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo announced that both parties will be given time tomorrow to consult on a way forward. Zuma is concerned that he’s being cross-examined and that when the Commission makes its findings, it will penalise him for the instances that he could not recall. He says many of these instances were not within his scope of responsibilities. Zuma’s lawyer, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane says that Zuma was brought to the Commission under false pretence. “I have a view that my client was brought here under false pretences. And now I need him to make up his mind whether he wants to be cross-examined because it is clear … it’s just been confirmed he is being cross-examined. Chair, all I am asking, Chair, because I advised my client to respect this process; come here, cooperate with it. I want to consider that position because I think I advised him in bona fide. But I do not think I was right and I would like him to consider his position, because it is now clear to me he is being cross-examined on the version, not his version, on what people said.” The State Capture Commission has, meanwhile, adjourned to Friday consult on the way forward.
