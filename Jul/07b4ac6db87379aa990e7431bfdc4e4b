Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha will on Friday deliver his State of the Province Address (SOPA) at Lebowakgomo. He is expected to focus on corruption, youth unemployment and water shortages among other issues. The Auditor-General’s recently released report showed that none of the province’s 27 municipalities received a clean audit. This includes the new Collins Chabane Municipality which was formed after the local government elections in August 2016. The SOPA event is returning to its original home at the Lebowakgomo Legislative Chambers for now. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) provincial leader, Jossey Buthane, says youth unemployment and housing should be at the core of Mathabatha’s address. Political analyst Elvis Masoga says Limpopo residents are expecting the Premier to present a practical plan to create jobs in the province. “The only way to attain immediate job creation in Limpopo is to make sure that the Premier speaks strongly about entrepreneurial development and industrial expansion,” says  Masoga.
