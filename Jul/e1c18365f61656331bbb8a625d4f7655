The Nelson Mandela Foundation and Gauteng Department of Human Settlements honoured their 67 minutes of Mandela Day at Palm Ridge where they assisted in bricklaying of community houses and holding a handing-over ceremony of the houses. This took place under the Habitat 4 Humanity banner and the Nelson Mandela International Day Build project, of which the City of Ekurhuleni and the community at large were the beneficiaries. The theme of 2019’s Mandela Day event is “The eradication of poverty”. The community was out in numbers to experience the event. But amidst the jubilation, some community members were frustrated about the housing backlog. Speaking to SABC News, a representative from Brand SA says this initiative seeks to bring various stakeholders together in efforts to ensure that everyone plays a part in uplifting those in need, whilst urging the community to get involved and take action against Poverty.
