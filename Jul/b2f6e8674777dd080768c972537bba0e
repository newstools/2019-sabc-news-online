The African National Congress has dismissed assertions that the meeting between party Secretary General Ace Magashule, Nomvula Mokonyane and the KwaZulu-Natal leaders were related to the problems in the eThekwini region. Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says they met the provincial leaders as part of their bid to understand the various ANC programmes that are being implemented by local structures. “The Secretary General (SG) had a meeting with the officials this is part of the organizational work you know that we now have a full time capacity at head office. The SG was accompanied by Comrade Nomvula Mokonyane. We met with the officials, we had other meetings in other provinces previously. The meeting in KwaZulu-Natal was not an extraordinary visit. It is part of the work that is being done to take stock and understand various programmes of the organisation and our own structures are managing organisational programmes at their levels.”
