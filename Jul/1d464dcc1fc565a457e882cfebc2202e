The African National Congress (ANC) says the decision to disband its Youth League was not an easy one. The league was disbanded following a decision by the ANC NEC which held a meeting at the weekend. The Revive ANCYL Movement, comprising of a number of regions of the league across the country says it welcomes the decision but, rejects the appointment of a senior team of ANC leaders to administer the league’s affairs. ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe… “There’s a NYTT that has been set up. It must be given the space to attend to things that must be attended to so that you have got a Youth League that immediately responds to the challenges of the day. The Youth League is very important for the ANC. It is a reservoir of leadership. It is the one that produces future leaders of the African National Congress.” A member of the disbanded league Zuko Godlimpi says the constitution of the ANC Youth League only allows for membership between the ages of 14 and 35… “We are truly unhappy with the decision of the ANC NEC members who appointed the people and none of them are youth. The people who are in that task team are above the age of 40 at least. That does not make any logical sense if we consider the substance of what we raised with the ANC NEC.” Click on the video below:
