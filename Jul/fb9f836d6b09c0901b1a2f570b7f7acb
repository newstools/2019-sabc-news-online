The Democratic Alliance (DA) has requested the International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor to recall South Africa’s ambassador to Netherlands, Bruce Koloane. This has been prompted by Koloane’s admission under oath at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that while he was still the Chief of State Protocol, he abused his position to benefit the controversial Gupta family. Koloane said he did so by enabling the family to land its private jet at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in 2013. The DA’s Darren Bergman says ambassador Koloane’s actions were a direct breach of national security and a violation of the National Key Point Act. “I wrote to the Minister of International and Corporation on Friday asking her to please ask her to recall the ambassador as soon as possible.” “We believe at this stage that the global stage is the most important space, where we operate. If we want to be open for business investment and job creation, we need not to send mix signals like a lying ambassador.” Watch a related video below for more on the story:
