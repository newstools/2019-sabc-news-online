The Chief Operating Officer of the Red Ants, Fuzile Balintulo, says they intend taking legal action against the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority  (PSiRA) for suspending their operating licence. The Red Ants have been suspended due to allegations of their alleged improper conduct whilst carrying out evictions in Gauteng. The authority says it has received numerous complaints from the public about the conduct of Red Ants workers during evictions or demolitions. Balintulo says they are shocked at the allegations. “We are looking at the contents of the suspension letter; we sent them to our attorney’s yesterday (Monday). We are consulting with our lawyers; once we are done we will be releasing the statement about the way forward. Certainly we will be challenging it but I cannot say to you what line we will pursue from now because we are in consultation with our lawyers who will then give us necessary advice and we will take it from there.” Click below for more on the Red Ants:
