The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) is demanding better treatment from the African National Congress (ANC), among other things. They marched to the ANC’s Luthuli House in Johannesburg on Monday demanding the recognition of military veterans. They’re also demanding the establishment of a dedicated ministry of military veterans – after being promised that the ministry would be set up between 2018 /2019. MKMVA Gauteng Provincial spokesperson, Bafana Mahlanye, says their members are not being taken seriously. “The ANC hasn’t taken time to analyse and properly process the issue of how do they handle the integration of ex-combatants into society. There have been so  many engagements, resolutions taken from Polokwane up to Nasrec, and those resolutions are very clear that MKMVA must be used as a resource in the political sector and security cluster because of the expertise that MK cadres have that they have they can contribute to the country,” explains Mahlanye. “But for some odd reason these resolutions are not being properly processed, they are ignored. If and when they are being implanted will be haphazardly. We want to open up the process of integration because our people have been side-lined through processes,” adds Mahlanye.
