Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha says they have enforced accountability at a political level in relation to the VBS Mutual Bank saga. Mathabatha was responding to questions raised during the debate on his address to open the provincial legislature in Lebowakgomo. He says they are working closely with law enforcement agencies to ensure that criminal cases are opened. “The VBS saga, at a political level, accountability has been enforced. There are cases that are now before the courts and these cases are being processed. On our part we are co-operating fully with the law enforcement agencies to ensure that justice does prevail for the victims of the VBS looting. But at the same time people should not be pre-judged by the court of public opinion,” says Mathabatha. The chairperson of the official opposition in the Limpopo legislature, Jossy Buthane from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), says they are not satisfied with the premier’s responses. “We can’t say we are satisfied with the response of the premier on the issues raised by the opposition parties. What  he has said leaves much to be desired, we will wait and see, we will watch. Today at least he spoke reasonably like a premier.” Watch a related video below:
