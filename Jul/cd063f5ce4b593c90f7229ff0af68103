The Commission of Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation has been postponed until Tuesday. This is due to the on-going bus strike in the Pretoria CBD. The Commission which was granted an extension until the end of October last week, was expected to continue to hear testimony from PIC former CEO Dan Matjila. So far 70 witnesses have implicated Matjila in wrongdoing. The former CEO will this week continue to give more evidence regarding the PIC and Ayo Technology Solutions deal. Matjila is also expected to speak on matters regarding the VBS bank. Click on the related video below:
