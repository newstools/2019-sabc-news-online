The Alexandra Shutdown Committee says it hopes the outcomes of the inquiry, will push government to speedily resolve the issues plaguing the township, north of Johannesburg. Friday was the final sitting of the hearings in Braamfontein hosted by the Human Rights Commission and the Office of the Public Protector. The inquiry has been probing the socio-economic conditions in the township and its impact on people’s human rights. Earlier in 2019, hundreds of disgruntled residents embarked on several days of protest over the mushrooming of illegal structures and a lack of service delivery. Co-ordinator of the Alex Shutdown Committee Sandile Mavundla says they will now wait for the recommendations. “We hope that the commission will take a decisive decision that will push the COJ, the provincial government and the national government to come together on point and address all from the social issues to the local economic development issues, housing backlog and all other educational issues and they need to be packaged together.” “Each department needs to play its role within resolving the issues facing the people of Alexandra.” Related video click below:
