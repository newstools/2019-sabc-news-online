The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will continue on Thursday with testimony relating to the multi-million rand Estina Dairy project in Vrede in the Free State. The commission’s evidence leader, Leah Gcabashe has told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that they are yet to hear from current and former senior Free State government officials, implicated in the controversial project. Among the mentioned officials, are former Free State Premier Ace Magashule and Agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane. Gcabashe says they have tried to reach out to them. Gcabashe says,”We have tried to engage Mr Thabethe, we continue to try, and we’ll come back to you by Friday when we break to tell you what progress we’re making. We are not making much progress at this point but we’ll see. If I may say, the intention is to have Mr Thabethe come; he certainly has his 33 notices.”
