Workers at the troubled Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape have downed tools, demanding a 6.5%Â  salary hike, as well as an outstanding progression increase. The unions also want the municipal manager, Thandekile Mnyimba, and Corporate Services director, Mziwodumo Dliwayo, removed. They claim the two are corrupt. However, both refute the claims. The strike action is affecting six municipalities serviced by the district municipality. Amathole is currently a category seven municipality while it is supposed to be a category six. Restructuring is under way. The workers have applied to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for a strike certificate. WATCH BELOW:
