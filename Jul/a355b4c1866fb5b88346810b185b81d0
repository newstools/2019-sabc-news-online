Friends and family came in their numbers to pay tribute to legendary musician Johnny Clegg. A public memorial service was held at the Sandton Convention Centre. Clegg died from pancreatic cancer last week, he was 66-years-old. Clegg’s manager Roddy Quinn held back emotions as he reminisced. “We’ll always remember him as a really strong humble person, who was very courageous, very strong and fearless. Throughout his career and the early days with apartheid he was arrested, his passport confiscated and harassed by the police and he continued to write songs which government banned but he carried on and never gave up.” Fellow friends and a onetime business partner Jessica Mbangeni says Clegg changed her life. “Today I am so pleased that through Johnny Clegg I am an agent of change. I am the centre of humanity. I am a global peace ambassador, Johnny Clegg has inspired my life so much that I am living the purpose to change the world.” Former President Kgalema Motlanthe and his spouse, as well as Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa were among those who came to show support.
