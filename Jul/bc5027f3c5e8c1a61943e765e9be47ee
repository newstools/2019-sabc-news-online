Chairperson of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Communications, Hope Papo says the committee will continue to support the SABC because of its public mandate. This comes ahead of the Communications Budget vote which is expected to be debated on Wednesday. The budget vote includes Icasa, the South African Post Office, Universal Services and Access Agency of South Africa, Broadband Infraco and the National Electronic and Media Institute of South Africa. In a statement released, Papo says the Committee has recommended in its budget vote report that Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams should continue engaging with the SABC and National Treasury on the Public Broadcaster’s financial situation. Papo says, in the meantime, the committee will await the enhanced turnaround strategy from the SABC, which should be available by the end of September 2019. All this will be reflected when the Committee tables the report during the budget vote debate on Wednesday.
