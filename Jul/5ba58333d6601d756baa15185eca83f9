Gauteng Premier David Makhura is going to set up an inquiry to probe taxi violence in the province. Makhura says killings due to taxi violence are escalating and he is planning to set up the inquiry in August. Speaking at a two-day Taxi Summit in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, Makhura says some people come from different provinces to operate in Gauteng, and this also leads to tensions as taxi operator’s fight over routes. Makhura says his government wants to know who’s behind the killings. “Taxi violence is not receding in our province. It is getting worse. The killings getting worse everywhere and the fundamental question is who is actually feeding this. And who is benefiting from this violence? I am going to appoint a retired judge to probe the underlying courses and the forces behind it this taxi violence,” says Makhura. Gauteng MEC for Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo told the summit that there’s a need to modernise the taxi industry. Gauteng taxi operators could find themselves back in the classroom if the government’s plans to modernise the taxi industry become a reality. The Gauteng government is looking at partnering with some of the universities in the province to train taxi operators on various issues including customer relations and managing their business. “I am looking at a partnership with universities in the province. Training content I’ll give them six months package together. We’re going to need experts to help us with which type of courses. Customer relations, driving skills. I am quite sure that poor driving is at the centre of accidents because they also affect other motorists that are not in the taxi.”
