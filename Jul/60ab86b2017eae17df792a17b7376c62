Opposition parties in KwaZulu-Natal have called on the African National Congress (ANC) to take decisive action on the on-going stalemate between the party and its members over the issue of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede. Her leave of absence ended on Tuesday,  however the ANC remains tight-lipped on whether she will be back to her office on Wednesday or not. The ANC provincial leadership had instructed Gumede to take a leave of absence after she was arrested for fraud and corruption in relation to a R208 million waste removal tender. Gumede’s supporters have threatened to return to the streets if she does not return to her office on Wednesday. IFP KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Thamsanqa Ntuli says eThekwini residents cannot be held to ransom because of ANC internal matters. Ntuli says, “We are quite concerned about the demonstrations which affects the economy since Durban is an economic hub of KZN. When there are many demonstrations that is going to threaten investors and again that will have a bearing on job opportunities. As the IFP, we are concerned as to why the ruling party is not taking charge, because what is happening is political, since it affects service delivery, it affects innocent people because of political issues which are between the ANC.” Related video below:
