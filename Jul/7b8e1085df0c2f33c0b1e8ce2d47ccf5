President Cyril Ramaphosa is responding to the Public Protector’s report against him. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that President Ramaphosa had misled Parliament about the Bosasa donation to his ANC presidential campaign. She has called on the NPA to probe the matter as well as Parliament’s ethics committee to look into the issue. However, Ramaphosa says the Public Protector has made errors in fact and in law.
