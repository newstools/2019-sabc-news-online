He is expected to reply to a range of issues including progress made on the Presidential summit on Gender-based violence which the Presidency hosted last year. IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi questioned Ramaphosa about the implementation of the outcomes of the summit. “Where is the budget to track progress on the Presidential summit on gender-based violence which the Deputy  President mentioned? That summit was held seven months ago, yet government is still talking about how to implement its resolutions.”
