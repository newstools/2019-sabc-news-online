The former CEO of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC)Â  Dan Matjila has called for the PIC to get an independent board chairperson. He was testifying in Pretoria before the judicial commission of inquiry into the PIC on Monday. Matjila says a chairperson who is also a deputy finance minister should have limited involvement in making investment decisions because the PIC is a major investor in the bonds of state-owned entities, to avoid a conflict of interest.
