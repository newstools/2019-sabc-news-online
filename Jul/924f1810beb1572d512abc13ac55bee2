Political analyst Kwandiwe Kondlo says the personality politics playing out in the African National Congress (ANC) will not advance the governing party’s agenda to develop the country. This follows Hanekom’s admission that he met with Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Secretary-General, Godrich Gardee, to discuss how to get rid of the then President Jacob Zuma through a vote of no confidence. The ANC is holding its regular NEC meeting in Irene, Pretoria, this weekend. Reports emerging from the meeting say Hanekom is enjoying good support among his NEC counterparts. Kondlo says it’s not surprising that the majority of the ANC National Executive Committee members support one of their own Derek Hanekom. “The Ramaphosa faction is actually getting an upper hand. I would not be surprised because Ramaphosa is the president of the ANC and he definitely commands a lot of support but one could even say within the ANC sanity is beginning to prevail to say look guys we can’t keep fighting over very petty issues when we have serious agenda items of policy we need to deliver on.”
