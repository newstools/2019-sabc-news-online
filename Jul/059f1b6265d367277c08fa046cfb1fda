Ekhurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina says plans are afoot for the construction of a new university on the Gauteng East Rand. He says the project will contribute towards Mandela’s call to eradicate poverty and uplift the poor through education. In 2019, the Nelson Mandela Foundation has partnered with the City of Ekurhuleni to support four local causes focusing on shelter, education, food and nutrition and active citizenship. Masina says they are in the process of building 100 000 new low-cost houses. “We have got a number of initiatives we are building on. We are currently in a programme of building 100 000 housing human settlements; 59 000 service sites; we are busy currently electrifying the informal settlements. We are making sure the sanitation environment is much more acceptable in terms of rolling 1 is to 5 and a number of other initiatives, but much more interesting is we are in the process of building a new university of science and technology as part of ensuring that we encourage the future of South Africa.” Watch video below for Nelson Mandela quotes:
