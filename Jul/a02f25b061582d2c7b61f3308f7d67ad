Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Thabang Makwetla, says the Department of Defence and Military Veterans needs to have the capacity to deal with the needs of members of the Umkhonto Wesizwe Military Veterans Association (MKVA). Makwetla was speaking during the provincial elective conference of Mkhonto Wesizwe Military Veterans Association underway in East London. He says the Department is still understaffed and the number of employees cannot cope with the rolling out of benefits to the association members. “The Military Veterans Act of 2011 lists benefits and services of which government want to deliver to military veterans starting from support for funerals, education, health and housing for members. The Department of Military Veterans is far below from being able to roll out those benefits, as we speak the department has been unable to roll out those benefits. “ Earlier this year,  Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu announced that government will ensure that Umkhonto we Sizwe veterans benefit in every major government housing project. Sisulu spoke during the official hand over of about 500 title deeds to the beneficiaries of the Cornubia Housing Project north of Durban. During the event, Sisulu expressed how the government owes the MK veterans recognition for their role in the liberation struggle.
