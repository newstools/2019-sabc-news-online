The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it is seeking legal advice on how to further compel President Cyril Ramaphosa to act on the recommendations of the Public Protector on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. EFF leader Julius Malema says the president will have to make sure that Gordhan is shown the door. The Public Protector said in her report that Ramaphosa must outline what disciplinary action he will take against Gordhan over the decision to grant then South African Revenue Service Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay early retirement. Malema claims Ramaphosa’s conduct shows that he undermines the office of the Public Protector and that will soon be a thing of the past. Malema addressed the media at the EFF’s headquarters in Johannesburg. “His conduct invites all other politicians who are being investigated by the office of the Public Protector to also undermine its remedial actions. We are taking legal advice on how to compel him constitutionally to act on the Public Protector as we did with Zuma on Nkandla. It does not matter how we feel about the incumbent. We can even criticize her. The office must be protected and respected. ”      Click below for more on the story:
