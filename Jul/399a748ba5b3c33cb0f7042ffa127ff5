The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has confirmed that soldiers will not be deployed to gang-ridden areas on the Cape Flats on Friday. Police Minister Bheki Cele announced on Thursday that the army will be sent into hotspot areas following a spike in murders. SANDF spokesperson, Siphiwe Dlamini, says due processes will have to be followed. “We will deploy once we are satisfied that all the systems are put in place for the deployment. I will not be able to give you exact time , but will be deploying pretty soon. We need to make sure all the deployment papers are in place. We need to make sure that our soldiers have received full orientation of the area and we know where we are going to.” Watch video below:
