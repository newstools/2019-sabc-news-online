The African National Congress (ANC) has officially dissolved the ANC Youth League National Executive Committee and appointed a new task team to oversee the rebuilding of the League. This follows a spate of protest actions at the ANC’s headquarters in Johannesburg and Irene in Pretoria by the ‘Revive The ANC Youth League Movement.’ ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule says the party’s NEC meeting agreed to organise a National Elective conference of the ANC Youth League, by no later than January 2020.
