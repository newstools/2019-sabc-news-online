The High Court in Pretoria is expected to rule in the matter between Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on Monday. Gordhan had applied for a review and the setting aside of Mkhwebane’s findings against him regarding the so-called South African Revenue Service (SARS) ‘rogue unit’. Gordhan wants the court to set aside the Public Protector’s remedial action until a judicial review has been completed. He has denied that the unit set up to investigate tax evasion at SARS during his tenure as Commissioner was a ‘rogue unit’. The Public Protector found that the establishment of the unit in 2007 was unlawful and that Gordhan had violated the Constitution. In her remedial action, Mkhwebane gave President Cyril Ramaphosa 30 days to take disciplinary against Gordhan. Watch the video below for related news:
