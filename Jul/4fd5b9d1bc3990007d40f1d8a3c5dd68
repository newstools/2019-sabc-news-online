Three Cape Town firefighters have been hospitalised after attending to a fire in the Masiphumelele informal settlement near Kommetjie in the South Peninsula. Metro ambulance staff also treated a local man for heat exposure on the scene. The city’s Fire & Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carlese says the firefighters were apparently shocked by electrical wires on the scene. Carelse says they got the call that informal structures were alight in Houmoed Street shortly after midnight. “The initial response comprised of five firefighting appliances, a rescue vehicle and 21 staff members. When the first officer arrived on the scene, he made a quick assessment and called upon more resources. We currently have two divisions setup with 18 firefighting appliances, two rescue vehicles and 79 staff battling the blaze.” Carelse adds: “One adult male was treated for heat exposure by Metro ambulance staff. Three firefighters were hospitalised as a result of various injuries sustained during the incident.”
