South African Communist Party (SACP) deputy secretary general Solly Mapaila says more citizens’ education and engagement is needed on matters of national importance. He was speaking on Morning Live about concerns raised around ‘controversial’ parliamentary portfolio appointments. He says, “The Municipal Councils Act even states that a council has to consult the people before passing a local budget or that budget may be illegal. So, we have the legislation, we have laws, we have created the framework.
