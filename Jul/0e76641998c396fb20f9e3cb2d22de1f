City Power says most of its IT applications and networks that were affected by the cyber attack have been cleaned up and restored. The virus hit City Power on Thursday morning, compromising their database and other software, impacting most of their applications and networks. The power utility has assured customers that their details were not compromised and that they should not panic. City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena has apologised for the inconvenience caused. “These include the pre-paid vending system, which means that most customers will be able to access vending and buy electricity. If the customers are not able to then they need to tell us so that we are able to attend to those individual calls. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused to the people of the City of Johannesburg,” says Mangena.
