The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume in Parktown, Johannesburg on Friday morning, with a businessman from Vrede in the Free State, Willie Basson, taking the stand again. On Thursday, proceedings had to adjourn after evidence leader Advocate Leah Gcabashe expressed concern about the interpreter, who continued to misrepresent the facts during his translations. Basson testified that he met with the Gupta brothers at the dairy farm when he had been asked to do some construction work in the farm. Earlier in the day, the former Democratic Alliance councillor at the Phumelele Municipality told the commission that he was threatened several times, including by the police for exposing the wrongdoings at the Vrede dairy farm. This comes after he took to the media to prove that more than 45 cows had died at the farm, due to hunger and neglect. Basson is expected to shed some light on why the dairy farm project eventually lapsed. Click below to watch related video:
