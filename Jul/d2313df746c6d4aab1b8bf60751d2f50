Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says the timing of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s findings against him are questionable. He says it comes at a time when he is working to ensure the sustainability of State-Owned-Enterprises and to root out corruption. Gordhan has filed an urgent application to suspend and interdict the remedial actions contained in Mkhwebane’s reports against him. Briefing the media ahead of his department’s budget vote in Parliament on Thursday, he says: “The investigative unit at SARS, we have lawyer after lawyer judge after judge Kroon, Nugent saying nothing improper was done. Now we come back and say something improper was done, something that might have happened seven or eight years ago or 10 years ago is now revived in a systematic way at the behest of the same individual in order to make sure that our job which is to fix SOEs is interfered with. Time will tell who is being right and who is being wrong.”
