Hundreds of African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) members have marched to the party’s provincial offices in Durban to demand the reinstatement of suspended eThekwini Municipality Mayor, Zandile Gumede. They are also calling for the suspension of the metro’s Municipal Manager Sipho Nzuza. The marchers allege that Nzuza had signed off on a dodgy R208 million waste removal tender to Durban Solid Waste. Gumede and another senior Municipal Councillor, Mondli Mthembu appeared in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court in May on fraud and corruption charges relating to the tender and were granted bail of R50 000 each.
