Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema will again appear in the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the constitutionality of the Riotous Assemblies Act. Malema claims the Act is apartheid legislation which does not belong in the law books. He has been charged with violating the Act in Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal and in Bloemfontein after he urged supporters to invade vacant land. The criminal trial against Malema has been put on hold pending the outcome of his High Court application. Watch a related video below:
