Another African National Congress (ANC) member of parliament Collen Maine has resigned as a member of the National Assembly. Parliament has confirmed the resignation of Maine, who is also the ANC Youth League president. “The Office of the ANC Chief Whip confirms the resignations of comrade Zukisa Faku and comrade Collen Maine as ANC Members of Parliament (MPs). “Comrade Zukisa Faku’s resignation will take effect as of 31 July 2019, while comrade Collen Maine’s resignation is effective as of 5 July 2019,” reads a statement issued by the Office of the ANC Chief Whip, Pemmy Majodina. Maine, who has been seen as one of the supporters of the former President Jacob Zuma, was sworn in alongside other newly elected members of the National Assembly in May. It is believed Maine has cited “private matters” as his reason for leaving parliament. His exit follows that of another ANC MP, Zukiswa Faku who is also a former Buffalo City mayor. These resignations are the latest in a long list of former ANC MPs who quit just before and after they were sworn in as members of parliament.
