The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department is calling for calm after it is believed that a nine year-old Pietermaritzburg learner passed away from swine flu. A school circular from Merchiston Prep has issued a warning for parents to look out for symptoms, after one of its learners allegedly tested positive for the virus. Department spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa says the department is visiting the affected schools today as part of a full scale investigation. “We are calling for calm. We are saying to the affected schools, we are with them. We’re already in contact with the district manager there.” “We are going to go and visit the schools today so we offer any necessary support. The department of health in the province is already on board. The learners, some of them already have been admitted. We send condolences to those who have sadly passed away.”
