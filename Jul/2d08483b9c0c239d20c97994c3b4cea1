Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola has defended the National Prosecuting Authority’s attempts to seek private funding, saying its choices are limited. On Wednesday, the EFF leader Julius Malema warned that some of the donors could be among what he termed the ‘capitalists’ who may be involved in crimes which include tax evasion. Malema sounded the warning during the Presidency’s budget vote debate in the National Assembly. “When given an opportunity to appoint the National Director of Public Prosecutions, you outsourced the function and appointed an NDPP (National Director of Public Prosecutions) who is saying the NPA must accept private donations from private individuals and companies. What is South Africa going to be if the prosecuting authorities is funded by private capitalists, – who in South Africa are exclusively white and often engaged in many crimes and tax avoidance, massive fraud and illicit financial flows?,” Malema said. However, Lamola says there’s no harm in seeking ways of raising funds for the NPA considering that it is operating on a shoestring budget.
