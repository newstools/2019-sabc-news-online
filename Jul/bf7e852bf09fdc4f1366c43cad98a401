As the South African  National Defence Force (SANDF) is poised to deploy troops on the Cape Flats,  there has been another fatal shooting in Blikkiesdorp, Delft.   A 22-year-old woman was also shot and wounded, and six structures set alight. The community says a minibus and a number of structures were petrol-bombed.  Gunshots were fired in the early hours of Saturday morning.  A 27-year old man was found with gunshot wounds to his head and body. The violence is said to be a result of revenge attacks by gangs. A group of women that spoke to SABC News, say the army must come as soon as possible.  “We didn’t sleep last night, those gangsters they come here burn hokkies and gunshootings, there is a guy now who is dead, this is place is terrible now, we’re not gonna sleep tonight, we are traumatised, we don’t even sleep at home, we don’t want to stay here anymore. “Yesterday I thought it was my last day in this world I was sleeping on the floor, I was crying and praying and pleading for my life, it was the worst day of my life because of gangsterism,” said another woman. Western Cape Community Safety Minister, Albert Fritz, says the basic human rights of people living in the Cape Flats will not be infringed upon when the army is deployed to gang-ridden areas. Fritz was speaking to the SABC following a meeting in Paarl with various role players. he says the army will only assist police to do their work. However, the SANDF announced that its members would not be deployed on Friday as they needed to complete the paperwork to ensure that the move is in line with the constitution. The SANDF says its operation to assist the police in fighting crime on the Cape Flats will be known as Operation Prosper.T here’s a high police presence in areas such as Philippi East, where 11 people were shot and killed in three incidents last weekend.
