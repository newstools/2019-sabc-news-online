There is still no end sight to the current wage impasse between the City of Tshwane and its employees. Members affiliated to the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) have been on strike since Monday.   They are demanding an 18% salary increase, backdated to 2017. The conciliation process between the union and the city was postponed to Wednesday at the bargaining council. The union alleges that only senior officials received a 36% wage increase. Samwu’s Mpho Tladinyana says, “If we don’t agree with the city on Wednesday, it’s then that maybe a certificate of non- resolution will be issued out, giving us the full right to embark on industrial action. So we have never been on strike, we have been engaging in a particular meeting. Our demands remain, 76 senior managers were paid 18% and therefore it is our demand that all of us, general workers, cleaners, must also be paid 18%.”
