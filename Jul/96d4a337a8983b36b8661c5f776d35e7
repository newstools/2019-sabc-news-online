The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers’ Union (Bemawu) has vowed to fight any retrenchments, should a government cash injection result in employees losing their jobs. This follows Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni‘s announcement on Tuesday, that cash injections for state-owned entities such as the SABC, SAA and Denel wouldn’t be handed over all at once, but in chunks, as certain conditions will have to be met. The tabled Appropriations Bill includes provisions for R3.2 billion for the cash-strapped public broadcaster. Mboweni says Chief Restructuring Officers for each entity would be announced. Bemawu President, Hannes du Buisson, says they will look into the impact of the appointment of an external restructuring team for the SABC. “Staff are overjoyed and I think that is a huge relief for staff to know that funding is coming. Of course the problem is now the fear of what the future would hold for the SABC in terms of a Chief Restructuring Officer for the SABC that we would have to deal with, if we are going to be faced with that.” “We hope that the monies that the SABC received are not going to be used to retrench staff. We are going to fight any retrenchments.” “We believe that the SABC has got the potential to grow tremendously in terms of the new technology that is being implemented at the SABC, so we don’t believe there is a need for any staff reductions.” Click video below:
