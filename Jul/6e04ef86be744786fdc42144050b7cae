Funeral preparations for the African National Congress (ANC) struggle veteran, Isaac “Bra Ike” Maphoto, are at an advanced stage. The 88-year-old stalwart passed on after a long illness.   He had spent many years in exile. Maphoto was also arrested by the then Rhodesian forces, now Zimbabwe, where he was given a death sentence.   Bra Ike, as he was known, was released after the liberation of that country having served 14 years. ANC secretary in Limpopo, Soviet Lekganyane, says they’re expecting senior party and government leaders to bid Bra Ike a fitting farewell.   “It would be unusual if we are going to bury bra Ike and there’s no senior leaders of the country and former combatants of the uMkhonto weSizwe. In particular, those of the Luthuli detachment who may still be alive we’re expecting hordes of senior combatants of the African National Congress but we’re also expecting leaders of the government,” adds Lekganyane.
