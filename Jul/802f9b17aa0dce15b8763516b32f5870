Former President Jacob Zuma is from Monday expected to make the much-anticipated appearance before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture after previous witnesses gave damning evidence against him. Zuma is accused of overseeing mass looting of state funds during his nine-year reign before President Cyril Ramaphosa replaced him in 2018. Zuma has denied all wrongdoing, and his lawyers have described the inquiry as an attempt to “ambush and humiliate” him. Over the next few days, Zuma will have an opportunity to set the record straight about all the allegations levelled against him. He has since told the SABC that he will indeed be at the commission on Monday as requested. The former president is also expected to quizzed on the testimonies of former ministers Nhlanhla Nene and Barbara Hogan as well as that of former government Spokesperson Themba Maseko among others.
