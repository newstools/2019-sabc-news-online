Community members in Philippi East on the Cape Flats have welcomed the deployment of additional police officers to their area. Members of the South African National Dedense Force are expected to join the police on the Cape Flats where they are supposed to carry out a massive joint operation. On Thursday night, Police Minister Bheki Cele announced that the President has authorised the deployment of the SANDF to areas most affected by crime and gang violence. This follows a spate of killings… last weekend 11 people were killed in Philippi East alone. Two others were killed in Hanover Park. One Philippi East residents had this to say: “I’m happy to see the police around because we are very scared to walk when it’s dark, so now it’s safe. I can take out my cell phone, its fine. But when there’s no police around it’s not safe at all.” No members of the SANDF have yet been deployed on the Cape Flats… however there is a heavy police presence at the Phillipi East police station.
