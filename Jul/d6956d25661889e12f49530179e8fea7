Dwindling support of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) aligned student wing South African Democratic Students Movement (Sadesmo) is expected to be a heated topic. This as the IFP Youth Brigade (IFPYB) holds its national conference, in Ulundi, northern KwaZulu-Natal. Other issues expected to top the agenda include unemployment among the youth. Sadesmo once controlled SRC’s in the Mangosuthu University of Technology and at the University of Zululand but has over the year been losing SRC elections. The last Youth Brigade conference was held in 2011 and the subsequent conferences shelved due to factions and mushrooming of bogus branches. Outgoing IFPYB national chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa explains. “Sadesmo continues to be an area of concern for us and we are confident that the set of recommendation that we will be giving to the conference going forward will enable Sadesmo to re-find its space. The only caution we want to give to Sadesmo is not to see itself as an extension of the youth brigade and therefore embroiled themselves in the internal politics and politicking of the youth brigade. While they are an affiliate of the youth brigade we encourage them to maintain their independence so that they can be able to roll out their own programmes. So we will be giving them our support,” explains Hlengwa. Watch video below:
