The Passenger Rail Agency (PRASA) and the police will join forces to beef-up security on trains nationwide. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says he will soon be signing a memorandum of understanding with Police Minister Bheki Cele. Briefing the media in Cape Town, Mbalula says this includes basic training by the agency’s security guards. “Within our fold, we do have the security capabilities that need to be beefed up within the context of the law. And the only people who have the law authority and overseeing people is the Minister of Police. So we will work with him and create a multiply force in the trains as we promised. And that hopefully will be at the end of the year.”
