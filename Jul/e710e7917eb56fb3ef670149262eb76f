Parliament says it will be very difficult for it to conduct oversight over the Office of the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development says it will try to speak with the Chief Justice and persuade him to appear in person before Parliament. This came during the Office of the Chief Justice’s presentation of their annual performance plan. Chairperson of the Committee Bulelani Magwanishe says the Constitution enshrines the separation of powers and the judiciary is therefore a distinct and independent entity. “We are also interested in this oversight model because it also affects the type of information that we received for our oversight work. I was talking to one member just before we started with our meeting and said it is a very difficult engagement to have. It is not like we are doing an oversight on other departments. So we will really need to engage on some of those issues. It is a new area, it is a developing area, we are quite aware of that.”
