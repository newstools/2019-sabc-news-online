The Western Cape Department of Social Development has launched a new Child Protection SMS Hotline as part of its child protection campaign. The campaign is aimed at safeguarding and promoting the well-being of children. Ministry spokesperson Joshua Chigome says it is mandatory for professionals such as teachers, nurses, doctors, therapists, and social workers to report any suspected child abuse. “The launch of this new Child Protection SMS Hotline 31022 aims to add another layer of the safety net in protecting children.  As citizens, we are all responsible for the well-being of every child in our community. So, if you suspect a child is being abused or neglected, it is everyone’s duty to report it.  Simply SMS the word ‘help’ to 31022 and we will call you back.”
