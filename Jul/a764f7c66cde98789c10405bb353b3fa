Former Chief of state protocol, SA Ambassador to the Netherlands, Bruce Koloane has conceded to name dropping to exert pressure during the controversial Waterkloof Airforce Base (AFB) landing of the Gupta private Jet.  DCJ talks about the email that Koloane’s assistant had sent which asserted that he telephonically approved the request. “I was merely communicated about the request to process the clearance,” says Koloane.#StateCaptureInquiry — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) July 9, 2019  Koloane told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that using the names of former President, Jacob Zuma, former Transport Minister, Ben Martins, and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, was an error in judgment.  Norman tells Koloane that if he says he was disciplined then what were the charges, if he recalls correctly, he says he thinks they are related to protocols not followed and undue influence. Koloane asks for help obtaining the relevant documents with the charges.#StateCaptureInquiry — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) July 9, 2019  “By my own admission that I erred, it was an error of judgment in wrongfully using the names of the former Transport Minister, Ben Martins and Defence Minister [Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula] and former President [Jacob Zuma] in the statement that I made to try and exert pressure to the officials who were supposed to facilitate the processing of the flight clearance,” adds Koloane.
