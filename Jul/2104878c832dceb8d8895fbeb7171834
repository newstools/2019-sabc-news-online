A water reservoir, in the Ntabankulu Municipality in the Eastern Cape where health specialists have detected poisoning, will remain closed until further notice. This follows allegations that the water was contaminated by angry residents who have been up in arms over the demolition of housing structures by the municipality. Residents have denied any role in the alleged poisoning of the water. “The municipality came and demolished our houses on Wednesday. We have asked the ANC to intervene but we haven’t got any response yet. They came with security agencies and police officers. We were not informed and we don’t know why they are doing this to us,” says community leader, Mthokozisi Feketa. The municipality says it has a court order for the demolitions. “The site is under land claim. The Magistrate told us the land shall not be occupied until the land judgement is made. We received a court interdict to demolish those existing structures,” says Ntabankulu Municipal Mayor, Tsileng Sobuthongo. The Mayor says the reservoir has been closed as a precautionary measure.
