The African Union Commission is calling for an independent investigation into the bombing of a detention centre in Libya where over 40 people are reported to have been killed. Libya remains in internal conflict as the UN-backed Government of National Accord and the Liberation National Army have failed to find a truce. So far nobody in Libya has claimed responsibility for the bombing which the UN has described as a war crime. Most of the 44 killed and over 100 injured are believed to have been from Sub Saharan Africa. Smugglers regularly transport migrants through Libya in order to make the dangerous crossing over the Mediterranean sea to Europe. When he visited the country in April, the AU Commission Chair Moussa Faki requested that the detained illegal migrants be treated with dignity during the conflict period. Since 2017 the African Union, European Union and the United Nations have enabled the voluntary repatriation of 33 000 Africans from Libya. The African Union is yet to set a date for a planned Reconciliation Conference between the two parties in Addis Ababa. As African Heads of State meet in Niger for a summit later in the week, Libya is likely to be at the top of the agenda.
