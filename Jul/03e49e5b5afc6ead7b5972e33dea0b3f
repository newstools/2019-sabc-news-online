The Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she is a subject of an orchestrated campaign to get rid of her, because she is prepared to hold the most powerful people to account. She has rejected reports by Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), that global bank HSBC has ‘flagged’ her, as having financial links to the Guptas. Mkhwebane says she has no links with the Guptas. In a statement Mkhwebane says she heard for the first time last Thursday that she had been ‘flagged’. She says the project has admitted that there was no indication that the source of the  $5000 she allegedly received was from the Guptas. Mkhwebane’s Spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, says the latest allegations against her come as a surprise. “She was not expecting anything of this sort because at least last week when we were asked the allegations or the information that was brought to her attention months ago was that people were snooping around in her bank account. “She wouldn’t have thought it would take this long and go as far as concoct things that are not there.” Click below to watch the full interview:
