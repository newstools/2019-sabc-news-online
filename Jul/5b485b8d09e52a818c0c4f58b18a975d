The 40-year-old man who was arrested for the attempted murder of a homeless man in Pretoria will appear in the city’s Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning. The man is charged with assault and attempted murder. He was supposed to appear in court last Friday. However, the National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane, said the case was struck from the court roll because the 48-hour holding period had expired. The man was arrested last week. Police have denied suggestions that the man is linked to the recent killings of five homeless men in the Muckleneuk area in Pretoria. Watch related videos:
