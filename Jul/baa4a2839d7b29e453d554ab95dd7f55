The former CEO of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) Dan Matjila has denied spying on his colleagues despite some of the witnesses testifying to the contrary. He told the commission of inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation in Pretoria on Monday that he believed his colleagues were acting in the best interest of the organisation but was disappointed when he found out that those that he had trusted were implicated in wrongdoing. Matjila will continue his testimony on Tuesday. “I think I had only five departments that I was looking at, it was not a big number. But why were they saying that you were spying on them? And some of them were very, very adamant that you were spying on them. I don’t understand what was the nature of the spying because all we really did was scan e-mail correspondents on Mim cast that was it.” Click on the video below:
