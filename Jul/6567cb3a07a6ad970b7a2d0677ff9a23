Tenants of a block of flats at the Kliptown square in Soweto are protesting on Friday morning. They have blocked roads in and around Kliptown. The protestors say they have received letters from the City of Johannesburg’s Social Housing Company , JOSHCO  informing them of the company’s intention to evict them due to outstanding rentals. They allege that the company has also threatened to switch off all services including electricity and water. The residents’ spokesperson Boy Motsoeneng says they were promised ownership of the flats but this has not happened. He says, “We understand that we need to pay the rent. We also want ownership.  But the question of how we going to sustain that ownership they don’t want to listen to us.  We don’t only want to live for free, but we want ownership that’s going to be sustainable.  That’s the reason we are on the streets.” Meanwhile, on Monday, Dube residents also barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks.
