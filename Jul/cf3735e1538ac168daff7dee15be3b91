President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement (AfCFTA) as the realisation of the African forefathers’ dream. Talking about the formation of the world’s largest trade bloc, President Ramaphosa says Africa is finally realising the dreams of its greatest leaders. He says Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and Julius Nyerere would be proud of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. Ramaphosa was speaking during an exclusive interview with the SABC on the sidelines of the AU meeting in Niger. He says Africans will now be able to trade more effectively and competitively with each other.  Ramaphosa says, “Africa is fulfilling the dream of the founders of the OAU when they conceptualized the formation of an integrated Africa. This is where SA stands to gain a great deal; because as the industrial powerhouse of the continent, we are going to be able to reap the benefits knowing that those products can penetrate various markets on a tariff-free basis or near-tariff-free basis.” 55 African countries have signed the AfCFTA agreement which will cover a 3-trillion-dollar Gross Domestic Product. Nigeria was the last country to sign the agreement on Sunday at the African Union (AU) Summit in the capital of Niger, Niamey.
