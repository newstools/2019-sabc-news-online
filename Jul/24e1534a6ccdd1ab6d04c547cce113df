South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) General-Secretary, Mugwena Maluleke, says township schools are lagging far behind former model-C schools across the country. The union adds that it’s time to end racism in schools. Maluleke says it’s unacceptable that African learners attend dilapidated schools without toilets. He was addressing delegates in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg, at a conference held under the theme “Decolonisation of Basic Education”. “Maybe you did not teach at a school where there is no toilet, but it is normal for an African teacher and an African child to teach in that particular school where there is no toilet and its normal in 2019 to talk about we are still eradicating the mud schools. We are still eradicating the schools without toilets. Where do you find these particular schools? You’ll never find them in Sandton but you will find them in African communities, and it’s normal isn’t it? That’s how institutionalised racism lives,” says Maluleke.
