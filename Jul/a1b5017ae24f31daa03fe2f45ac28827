The embattled Lesotho Prime Minister and leader of the All Basotho Convention (ABC) Tom Thabane has defended his position, saying he is the only legitimate leader and founder of the party. The ABC suspended Thabane at the weekend. Addressing his deeply fractured party rally at the weekend, Thabane reprimanded 52 of the 80 constituencies that sat to confirm his six-year suspension. Thabane’s fallout with his executive committee follows a highly-contested outcome of the ABC’s National Elective Conference that saw his rival Nqosa Mahao emerge in a deputy leadership position. The ongoing power tussle in the ABC is likely to be resolved in Parliament during the upcoming vote of no confidence in Thabane.
