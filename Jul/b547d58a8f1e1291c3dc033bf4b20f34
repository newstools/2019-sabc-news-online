Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema says his party will protect the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane all the way to the Constitutional Court if need be. The EFF has joined Mkhwebane in her legal battle with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Gordhan brought an urgent application to the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday to have Mkhwebane’s findings against him suspended until the judicial review has been concluded. Mkhwebane found that Gordhan’s establishment of a so-called rogue unit in SARS while he was still Commissioner of the Revenue Service was a violation of the Constitution. In her remedial action she recommended Ramaphosa to take action against Gordhan over the findings. Judgment has been reserved in the matter. Malema was addressing supporters outside the court. “Cyril Ramaphosa must stop being a coward and act against Pravin because Pravin is not above the law and discipline means a simple thing. he must be fired.” “Pravin is highly connected even in this court. We are not expecting anything but she must know that if she rules against us we are petitioning the Constitutional Court directly.” Click video below:
