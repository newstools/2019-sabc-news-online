The newly elected chairperson of the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Committee Faith Muthambi has vowed to work with all members regardless of their party affiliation. This followed her election amid objections from the Democratic Alliance (DA). The DA argued that Muthambi was not suitable to chair the committee as she had credibility issues hanging over her head. Muthambi has been accused of political interference in the SABC during her tenure as Communications Minister in former President Jacob Zuma‘s cabinet, among other things. Despite his objection and putting himself up as an alternative, the DA’s Haniff Hoosen congratulated Muthambi and offered his co-operation. Muthambi says the committee’s oversight work takes precedence. “I’m humbled by the words from both parties. I dare not disappoint. I assure you. We are going to push what is expected of us and as Honourable Hoosen said I will treat you equally, I am the chair of each member, when we are in the committee there is no political party. We have got one agenda to do oversight on the portfolio we are given to oversee.” Meanwhile, former State Security Minister Bongani Bongo has been formally elected as the Chairperson of the Home Affairs Committee. The DA had also objected to that nomination.
