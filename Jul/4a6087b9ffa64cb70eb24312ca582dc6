A 32-year-old man has been arrested and is expected to appear in the Ngodwana Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga on a charge of excessive speeding. The provincial Department of Community Safety says the man was  driving at 216km/h in a 100km/h zone on the N4 toll road in Schoemanskloof. Department spokesperson Moeti Mmusi says the suspect is expected to make a bail application on Tuesday. “The suspect was driving a BMW 650 sports vehicle and he was travelling from Mbombela towards Pretoria at the time of the arrest. We are once more appealing to motorists to be mindful that speed continues to be one of the major causes of deadly crashes that occur on our roads. So we are appealing to them to stick to normal speed limits that are set at various parts of our roads as part of contributing towards reducing road crashes.”
