The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has rejected Premier David Makhura‘s proposed solution to settle e-toll debt. In his State of the Province Address (SOPA), Makhura said he was ready to settle some of the debt in order to get rid of e-tolls. While the Democratic Alliance (DA) asked where that money would be coming from, the EFF rejected the proposal outright, saying Gautengers should not be made to pay for ANC mishaps. Earlier, the DA gave Makhura until August to make a plan. “The Premier knowingly set up a dishonest 10 member e-toll panel. Yet today, he says the solution will come from national. There’s nothing else to be done, Premier, with the toll system. You have wasted money on the panels. You need to scrap the e-toll system. Why should the people of Gauteng shoulder the cost of settling a debt. We had no business in incurring and had not been engaged in terms of you applying to the Austrian government for that debt. Deal with it. Deal with it with your ANC minister,” says the EFF’s Mandisa Mashego.
