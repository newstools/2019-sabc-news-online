An application by the former Eastern Cape director for Early Childhood Development, Portia Sizani, to be released on a warning, has been rejected by the Port Elizabeth Specialised Commercial Crimes court on Monday. She’s been found guilty of fraud and money-laundering. The court sat for sentencing after convicting her of defrauding the department of R1.2 million for creating ghost teachers for ECD centres and pocketing the cash. The Defence had requested that the court cancel the bail requirement and refund Sizani the R5000 paid. Portia is the wife of Stone Sizani – South Africa’s Ambassador to Germany. The court has adjourned until tomorrow. Watch related video below:
