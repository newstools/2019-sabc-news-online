Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malemaâ€™s application to have the Riotous Assemblies Act unconstitutional has been dismissed by the Pretoria High Court. Malema appeared in the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the constitutionality of the Riotous Assemblies Act. He claims the Act is apartheid legislation which does not belong in the law books. He has been charged with violating the Act in Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal and in Bloemfontein after he urged supporters to invade vacant land.
