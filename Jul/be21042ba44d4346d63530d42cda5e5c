The African Union has warned against curbing travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) despite the “high” threat of the spread of the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak on record. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC began a year ago and has killed more than 1700 people. The World Health Organization this week declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern.” The WHO has urged countries to keep transport routes and borders open but increase surveillance at all their points of entry. The AU’s Disease Control director, John Nkengasong says:”We want to be sure that the international community and members of states in Africa do not impose any restrictions on travels to anyone going into or coming outside of the DRC.” “By doing such actions it would impede our ability to effectively control the virus. It’s a strong call to action; we cannot and should not attempt to do anything that would affect the normal functioning or trade with the DRC.” Related video click below:
