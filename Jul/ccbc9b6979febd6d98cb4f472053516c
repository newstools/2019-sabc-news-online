Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has reiterated his stance that his department is determined to address what he calls a ‘road carnage crisis’. He has warned that his department will implement measures to deal harshly with traffic law enforcement officers who undermine efforts to improve safety by soliciting bribes as well as motorists who offer bribes. Mbalula was speaking in Parliament during a debate on the department’s budget vote. “We have a road carnage crisis on our hands and it is time to call it what it is – a road carnage crisis. It requires a drastic mission unusual as a response. Chairperson, our resolve to arrest the carnage on our roads has never been greater. The implementation of a 24-hour-7 days shift project within the traffic law enforcement fraternity has become more urgent than ever before.”
