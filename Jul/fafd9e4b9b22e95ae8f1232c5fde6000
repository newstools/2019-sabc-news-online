Thousands of trees have been planted near Knysna in the Southern Cape by volunteers from across the world. This formed part of the Eden Festival of Action hosted by the non-profit organisation Greenpop. Over the past couple of years, their focus has been on the reforestation of the Garden Route following the devastating 2017 fires. Over the past three weeks, they’ve planted 4 500 trees in the region. Greenpop director, Misha Teasdale, says they knew they had to help after the fires. “For us, that was a big catalyst to come and do more significant work on the garden route. Over the last two years we’ve invited people from all over SA and the world to come and join us in helping to restore some of these ecosystems and to learn necessary skills to develop one’s own personal journey in terms of sustainable development,” says Teasdale.
