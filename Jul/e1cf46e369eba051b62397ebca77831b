A multi-million rand project to construct a modern transport facility for commuters in Vereeniging in the Vaal Triangle is yet to be completed, almost six years after it was started. The construction of the Taxido taxi rank was supposed to take one year to complete, but well over five years later commuters still have to contend with harsh weather conditions. This week, the Gauteng government will host a two-day Provincial Taxi Summit to examine a number of issues affecting the industry, including the lack of infrastructure for commuters. Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Jacob Mamabolo has promised commuters that the taxi rank will be completed soon. “The taxi rank in Vereeniging is the fundamental priority. It is an important priority and we will also announce in due course what we are going to do with that matter so that we can reopen the taxi rank. That taxi rank is quite central to the economy of Vereeniging. As we speak many shops have closed. That area around the taxi rank is almost a ghost town because of the negative impact of the six-year-long non-completion of that taxi rank.”
