The father of late Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa has died. Fifty-six-year-old Sam Meyiwa died in the early hours on Monday morning at his home in Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal. Meyiwa has been making headlines with complaints about the lack of progress in the investigation into his son’s murder. Family member Nomalanga Meyiwa says the family is saddened by his death. “Mr Meyiwa was a person that all the family relied on. So we’re finding it very hard to accept, but there’s nothing we can do. If it was God’s plan we are accepting it and we’ll find comfort from him.”
