A number of people have reportedly been arrested, including a journalist, amid scuffles between police and supporters of eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, in Durban. Police used stun grenades to disperse the group of protestors, who were blocking a road near Durban’s City Hall, causing traffic disruptions. They are demanding Gumede’s immediate return to office after her forced leave of absence, due to corruption charges against her, was extended for a further 30 days by the African National Congress on Wednesday. Traffic is now being redirected from Field Street to avoid the roadblock at the corner of Dorothy Nyembe and Doctor Pixley KaSeme Streets, formerly West Street. A journalist from one of the newspapers was arrested. Several journalists were also manhandled allegedly by the police and they are saying it is because these journalists did not have any form of identification. In the ensuing chaos, police tried to prevent the media from taking pictures as they arrested some protesters. The protesters blocked the entrance to the City Hall, preventing staff and councillors from entering. Municipal staff were allegedly also forced to leave their offices in another building close by. At least four of the protestors were taken away by a police van. Additional reporting by Vusi Makhosini.
