Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi has expressed dismay and shock at how some companies treat employees. This follows media reports about Amos Mabuza who is now partially blind due to a freak accident at work. 62 year-old Mabuza was fired after an accident at his work place that left him partially blind. After 30 years of service, the father of four has been left without a job and cannot look after his family. Minister Nxesi says investigations will take place and the law will take its course. “We think that it was very irresponsible, it was criminal by the employer who has worked for 30 years for that particular employer, once injured he’s neglected, he is fired. We as the department are going to be able to follow up this matter, that’s why we are here with the DG and the compensation fund is here. We are going to quickly launch the investigation while on the other side dealing with the issue of compensation.”  [Watch] Nxesi dismayed by illtreatment of employees by some companie
