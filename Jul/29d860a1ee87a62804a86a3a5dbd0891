Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina says there was nothing wrong in the granting of a R1.9 billion tender to put up portable toilets in informal settlements. The amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism earlier alleged that it was a jobs-for-pals scheme with 16 companies being offered the tender. Masina says the tender was about increasing the number of temporary toilets from 9 000 to 39 000 units in the Metro’s 119 informal settlements. Masina was not yet mayor when the tender was awarded, but says he could not find anything wrong with the process. “There is no scandal here of R1.9 billion. There was a deliberate policy, which was implemented by the administration so they did nothing wrong. So, I won’t say they awarded their friends or didn’t award their friends. There was no scandal. There was nothing here.”
