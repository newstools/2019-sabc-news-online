The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has assured Mpumalanga residents that corruption will be rooted out as his party is now the official opposition in the province. He was speaking at the party’s sixth anniversary rally at the KaNyamazane Stadium on Saturday. Malema says the EFF is keeping an eye on government officials who are perpetuating corruption. “It is in this province where there is no single successful court case against corrupt politicians.” ‘Education key to success’ Malema has also highlighted the importance of education, saying it is the key to success. “Go and fight for our children in the universities. We want free education in TUT, here in Nelspruit. We want free education in UNISA, in the Mpumalanga University and all the TVET colleges.” EFF supporters who attended the rally say they can relate to Malema’s message. “We’re supporting the EFF. I was here when Julius Malema told us that in all institutions of learning in South Africa, we should be responsible for ourselves.”
