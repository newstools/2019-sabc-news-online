A multi-million rand upgrade of the Zandvliet waste water treatment plant in Cape Town will increase it’s daily capacity by 20 million litres. The plant currently treats of 72 million litres of daily effluent from Kuils River, Blackheath, Delft, Blue Downs and Eerste River. The City of Cape Town says the project has been delayed numerous times due to tender appeals and a land claim, but completion of the R1,7 billion  upgrade is now expected by 2023. Mayoral Committee Member for Water and Waste Services, Xanthea Limberg, says the extra capacity will make it possible to cater for more housing developments and schools in one of the fastest growing areas of the City. ” Visiting the site and witnessing the staggering scale of the project really drove home how much work has been done thus far, and how much still lies ahead in this mammoth upgrade of the Zandvliet Wastewater Treatment Works. The City is committed to ensuring that it continues to evolve its processes to manage waste and to ensure that it does everything in its power to put in place enhanced processes for sustainable urban management,” says Limberg.
