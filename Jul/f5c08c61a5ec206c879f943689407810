The South African Communist Party  (SACP) says it is pressing ahead with its call for an inquiry into the fitness of the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, to hold office. This was in response to Mkhwebane’s announcement on Friday that she will be taking legal action against the party’s First Deputy General Secretary, Solly Mapaila. Mapaila had slammed Mkhwebane for becoming involved in the factional battles of the African National Congress (ANC). Mkhwebane gave Mapaila until Friday to retract what she said were derogatory comments he made about her while addressing the Nehawu Policy Conference. “I want to reiterate on behalf of the SACP, that nothing is going to pull the SACP back in terms of the decision taken by our central committee in June to call for an inquiry into the fitness of the incumbent Public Protector to hold office.”
