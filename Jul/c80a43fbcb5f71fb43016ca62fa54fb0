Former PIC CEO Dr Dan Matjila says he believes James Nogu got fed information from internal sources at the PIC. James Nogu is the alleged whistleblower that sent emails with allegations of wrong doing to PIC staff members. Matjila says he believe people from within the PIC were feeding documents to James Nogu who may have the the technical ability to distribute information. However, Matjila says he does not believe James Nogu should be described as a whistleblower.
He says there is a way of raising the flag about possible wrongdoing without damaging people’s reputation which he says it’s not what James Nogu was doing. Matjila says if the internal environment at the PIC is not conducive for employees to report possible wrong doing, then perhaps an external body like an Ombudsman would be ideal.
