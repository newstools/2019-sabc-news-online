Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements and Cooperative Governance Lebogang Maile has written a formal letter to Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina demanding an explanation following allegations of tender irregularities involving close to R2 billion. This follows an investigative report by AmaBhungane, which found that the city allegedly spent R1.9 billion on portable toilets. The report suggests that the project, where toilets were sourced from 16 small suppliers, was a get-rich-quick scheme for some under-performing contractors that left many beneficiaries with dirty and broken toilets. Maile says he views the allegations in a serious light, and if they are true, there must be consequences. “Starting from tomorrow, we will count and once the seven days working counted, we expect to be receiving a report from the municipality to clarify all the matters and allegations that have been publicised in newspapers because we view the matter in a serious light.”
