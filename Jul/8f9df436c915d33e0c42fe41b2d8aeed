Limpopo Police say an arrest is imminent after two ANC councilors, Valtyn Kekana and Ralph Kanyane, were gunned down in Mokopane on Tuesday. Kekana was the Chairperson of the Municipal Public Accounts Committee at the local Mogalakwena municipality and Kanyane was an ANC branch secretary. Political infighting is believed to have triggered the killing. Kekana was expected to deliver a report on fund mismanagement on Wednesday, but he was shot in cold blood just a day before the sitting. Friends and colleagues believe it was a hit aimed at silencing those who expose corruption. ANC member Sam Montana says that the Premier owes them answers. “There is one faction that thinks it rules the municipality. We are very tired of that and we want the Premier to come and explain; he owes us answers.” Police Spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says that a special team has been assembled to probe the killing and police believe the perpetrators will be arrested soon. “A team of investigators was established to track down the killers. We don’t know what the motive is, but from the information we have, we will be able to apprehend the killers.” Senior party officials are yet to visit the families of the deceased. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
