ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says the ruling party upholds the view that all individuals and organisations with information that is relevant to the work of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture should avail themselves and present it to the commission. Mabe says former president Jacob Zuma last week visited the ANC’s headquarters to brief the ruling party officials about his appearance before the Zondo Commission. He says the party views this visit as courteous and exemplary. “I wouldn’t want to go into the details of merits and demerits of what is being said in the commission. You’d recall that last year (2018) when the commission began, we issued a statement calling on all our members to make themselves available to give whatever evidence that might be appropriate to allow the commission to execute its work. We even deployed at the time comrade Zizi Kodwa before he went to the NEC, he was full time with you here making sure that when so required the ANC is in a position to file commentary. We are encouraging most our members when they are invited to the commission to respect the work of this body.” Mabe says if the ruling party would be invited to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, it wouldn’t hesitate to accept the invite. “If the ANC at a certain point would be required to come and make a formal representation and take a stand, the ANC shall do so. For now, individuals who are coming are giving their own version. The ANC has not been, if it is called the organisation shall be able to express itself. We are coming here because we’ve always been part of this commission.”
