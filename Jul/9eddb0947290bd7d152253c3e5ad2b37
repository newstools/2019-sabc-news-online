Political Analyst, Khaya Sithole, has described African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule’s statement – on NEC member and former Tourism Minister, Derek Hanekom – as an ‘internal ANC problem’. Magashule described NEC member Derek Hanekom as a wedge driver and on a mission to divide the ruling party. This after Hanekom confirmed that he met with Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  Secretary-General, Godrich Gardee, in a bid to oust former president, Jacob Zuma, from office. On Tuesday, EFF leader Julius Malema launched a scathing attack on Hanekom and the SACP’s Solly Mapaila – telling his party supporters that it’s strange that they are now called ‘fascists’ after they plotted with them to remove Zuma from power. However, Hanekom claims that there’s nothing wrong with meeting with other political parties for a common interest. Sithole says Magashule’s statement shows a clear  sense of frustration and anger within the ANC. “I think the way that the statement itself was released was not a problem of Derek Hanekom in particular, but an ANC problem. Now what it says is that there was clearly a sense of frustration and anger within the ANC. The first thing the ANC should have said was this was clearly an internal party matter, not a matter of state, we are going to have a conversation with him and after that a united statement but at least something that says we have decided as a mature organisation to sit down and ask him categorically what the motivation was and these are the steps we are taking going forward. It really came across as a one-sided broadside attack and that is something that the ANC should have thought beyond.” Click on the video below:
