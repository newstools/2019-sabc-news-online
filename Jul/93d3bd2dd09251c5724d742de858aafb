The family of Sam Meyiwa, the father of late Bafana Bafana goal-keeper Senzo Meyiwa, says it wasn’t a stroke that killed him but a broken heart. Meyiwa succumbed to a stroke in the early hours of  Monday at the age of 67. Meyiwa made it his life’s mission to see his son’s killers apprehended. Senzo was killed in October 2014 in Vosloorus Johannesburg. For the past five years, his father was relentless in his quest for answers. But in 2018 , Meyiwa, affectionately known as “Uncle Sam”,  suffered a stroke. His family says he was under immense stress. Neighbours have also described his death as a huge loss. They say the Meyiwa family is respected and helpful in the community. ” We used to sit with him almost daily and talk and laugh, it was fun, he was a good man. But yes the death of his son was something he would speak about, it wasn’t easy on him,”says a community member. The Meyiwa family say they will continue Sam’s quest to get justice for Senzo to honour his dying wish. Meyiwa is survived by his wife, four children and grandchildren. Funeral arrangements have not been finalised. Watch video below:
