The United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader, Bantu Holomisa who was instrumental in revealing the corruption at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) says the Corporation’s former CEO, Dan Matjila should also be investigated over allegations that he unduly benefited from a R2.45 million loan extended by the troubled VBS mutual bank. Matjila who is already facing numerous allegations of corruption, testified at the Commission on Monday. He has since denied that he took a loan from VBS. Holomisa says he has written a letter to the PIC commission to investigate these allegations. “VBS was bankrolled by PIC and the two directors which were seconded there by PIC helped themselves with its money. All we’re asking is why did advocate Terry Mudau, if this is correct, did he not pick it up because it could easily constitute a conflict of interest.” WATCH Bantu Holomisa Below:
