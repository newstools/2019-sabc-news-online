Former President Jacob Zuma says the African National Congress (ANC) recommends, it does not deploy candidates to positions. He has continued to testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. Zuma has sought to explain how appointments are made. The commission wants to establish whether there’s outside influence related to the appointments or not. Some witnesses have told the commission that they first heard about their planned appointments from members of the Gupta family. Zuma disputed former minister, Barbara Hogan‘s testimony that appointments were done on factional loyalty and deploying friends. “It may be her own view because of certain cases she may be aware of if such a thing happened. It’s not meant to take your friends if you’re a member. The committee discusses what type of a person we want, it’s not going to be which friend we take. She is putting a point, her own point because she might be having an experience of that nature, but in terms of the process it’s not done in the manner she’s putting it.” Click on the video below:
