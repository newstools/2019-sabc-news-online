Another witness has admitted to the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that he had lied about the Gupta family’s landing at the Waterkloof Airbase in 2013. Major Thabo Ntshisi, who works at the military base’s command post, has admitted that he mislead the Commission when he testified last week that he did not utter the words attributed to him in an South African National Defence Force’s board of inquiry transcript. This follows the confession of South Africa’s Ambassador to the Netherlands and former Chief of State Protocol, Bruce Koloane on Tuesday about former President Jacob Zuma’s involvement in the landing. Koloane said he was “names-dropping” when he used the names of Zuma and two ministers to get approval for the landing. Speaking through an interpreter, Ntshisi said listening to the recordings jogged his memory. “Yes I agree, I did say that those are not the words that I said. But after the recordings were played before the commission that’s when I then realised that indeed this is what I said.” Click below for more on the story:
