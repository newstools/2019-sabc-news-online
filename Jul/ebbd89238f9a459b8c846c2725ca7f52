A whopping 34.5% of the R45 billion of the KwaZulu-Natal budget will be allocated to the Department of Health. Finance MEC, Ravi Pillay, has delivered the province’s 2019-2020 budget in the provincial legislature in Pietermaritzburg. He has listed increasing staffing capacity at public healthcare facilities, increasing the number of HIV tests and decreasing the patient waiting time as some of the key concerns that the budget must address. “Some 1.4 million people are members of medical aid schemes while approximately 10 million or 87.4% are not medical aid members. This fits into the provincial priority of ensuring that good health services are provided. The commissioning of the new Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme Memorial Hospital is planned for 2019/20, as well as an increase in the number of clients on the Centralised Chronic Medicines Dispensing and Distribution from 1.7 million to 2.2 million,” says Pillay.
