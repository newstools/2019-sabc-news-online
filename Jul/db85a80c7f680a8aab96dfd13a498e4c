Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says he is willing to appear before the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg to respond to former President Jacob Zuma’s testimony which implicates him. Zuma claimed that businessman Johan Rupert had threatened that he and others “would shut down the economy” and interfere with the Rand if then Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was removed. Zuma claimed that Rupert had made the comments to Mbalula. Answering a question from a journalist in Cape Town, Mbalula says, “I have heard all those news when I was in London in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) meeting… When the former President made all those comments at the Commission. So all I am doing is to observe. In terms of the commission, I have never been a person who has never been ready to appear before the commission if I am required to do so. So I will be (appear) if I am required to do so. So there is no issue. So to talk in parallel will not help that particular process.”
