Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology Blade Nzimande says government will be implementing measures to make sure that other countries do not steal the innovations of local scientists. Nzimande was speaking at the official opening of the 2019 Science Week in Kimberley. This year’s event is in partnership with the Sol Plaatje University (SPU), the Northern Cape Department of Education and the South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement (SAASTA). The Minister says the innovations will be registered to ensure that creators can benefit.   “A tip of the iceberg is a number of patents that are created here, that is why as government, we are creating a system that what is innovated here, must be registered here so that those who came up with innovation, should be able to benefit, and not allow those innovations to be stolen, because lots of innovations have been stolen from our continent.” Nzimande added that the country’s economy stands to benefit a great deal from South Africa’s talent in the field of science and technology. “If we had to ensure a faster economic growth and development of our country, and I am absolutely convinced given the talent that you saw this (Saturday) morning, as well as the innovations that are here, and that are being displayed, that as a country we are capable, actually rising very high in the world in terms of science and technology,” expressed Nzimande.
