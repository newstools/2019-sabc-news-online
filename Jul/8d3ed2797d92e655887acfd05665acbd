President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to visit Lesotho on Wednesday on an official working visit. He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Thomas Thabane to discuss bilateral and regional issues. South Africa and Lesotho share strong cordial relations due to geographical and historical reasons dating back to the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. The structured bilateral relations between Lesotho and South Africa are conducted through the Joint Bilateral Commission for Cooperation which was established in 2001, and is convened at a ministerial level. The discussions include trade and investment, security, energy, transport, agriculture, tourism, water as well as environment. President Ramaphosa, in his capacity as SADC facilitator to Lesotho, will also receive an update on the progress of the reform process in Lesotho. Ramaphosa is expected to pay a courtesy call on His Majesty, King Letsie III, and engage with civil society groupings. The President will be accompanied by the Minister of Defence, State Security and the Deputy Minister of International Relations. Click video below:
