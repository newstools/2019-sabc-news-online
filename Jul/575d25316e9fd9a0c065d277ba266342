Various calls have intensified to have the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane removed from her position. In the latest move, the Helen Suzman Foundation has joined in the campaign. Lawyers representing the Helen Suzman Foundation have written to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise to demand for Mkhwebane’s removal. In the letter, the Foundation states that the call follows the recent decision by the Constitutional Court to dismiss Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s appeal in a case against the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). It further adds that “other recent judgements against Mkhwebane lead to the conclusion that she is not fit and proper to hold the Public Protector office.” “The longer Mkhwebane stays Public Protector, the more damage will be cause to the integrity of the office,” the letter reads. Earlier this week, Advocate Paul Hoffman, the director of Accountability Now made calls for Mkhwebane to be struck off the advocate’s roll. Amidst these calls, the South African Communist Party has (SACP ) also called for a parliamentary inquiry into the Public Protector.  Read the Helen Suzman Foundation’s full letter to the Speaker:
