Supporters of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane say they have already raised over R50 000 to help her with legal bills. This follows a Constitutional Court ruling that ordered that she must pay 15% of the R900 000 legal bill of ABSA.  Civil rights movement “Democracy in Action” says it started the crowdfunding to strengthen democracy and protect the constitution and its institutions. A “Hands Off Public Protector” page has been set up on twitter. The page called on the Public Protector to give them a signal when to deposit the funds, a tweet that Mkhwebane has retweeted.  Mkhwebane’s spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, says she has not been approached for donations and has not yet entertained the idea. The Chairperson of Democracy in Action, Thabo Mtsweni, says the funds raised would not be given to the Public Protector’s office directly, but will be sent directly to ABSA.
