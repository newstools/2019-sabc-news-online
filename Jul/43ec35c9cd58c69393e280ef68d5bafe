The 16 African National Congress (ANC) Councillors, who were sacked by the party’s Free State structure in 2018, say they are confident ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) will resolve their challenge. The Councillors held a meeting with a member of the party’s NEC David Mahlobo at the weekend, with the hope of finding solutions to the matter. The Councillors from the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality in Qwaqwa, were fired following the allegations that they had voted with opposition parties to oust former Mayor Vusi Tshabalala. One of the Councillors Shashapa Motaung says they want their jobs back. “We haven’t sat with an NEC to state our side or a deployee. So we are very confident with the information that we gave them that we are going to win this case. We also propose to them that we cannot run two parallel programmes. We are negotiating. So, we cannot have by-elections. We are negotiating.”
