A toddler has died and two boys are fighting for their lives after a fire broke out in a structure in an informal settlement in Bonela west of the Durban CBD on Monday night. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst says emergency workers found the two-year-old girl and two boys, aged six and seven respectively, lying unconscious on the floor when they entered the structure after 8 o’clock on Monday night. Herbst says the girl, who suffered smoke inhalation and burn wounds, was declared dead on the scene. “All three were evacuated. However, upon assessment, the young girl was found to have no signs of life and she was tragically declared dead on scene. The two other boys, aged six and aged seven, were treated for severe burns. Once they were stabilised the patients were rushed to hospital for further assessment. Circumstances leading up to the fire will be investigated by the relevant authorities.”
