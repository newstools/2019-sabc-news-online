KwaZulu-Natal Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) MEC has condemned the explosion at Msunduzi Municipality, saying no amount of intimidation would deter attempts to clean up the KwaZulu-Natal capital. This is after an explosion occurred yesterday at the City Hall, bringing a swift end to a council meeting. The municipality’s administrator, Sibusiso Sithole, was meant to present a report at city hall when the explosion took place. KwaZulu-Natal CoGTA Spokesperson and Head of Communications,  Lennox Mabaso says this is a form of terror. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/721684">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
