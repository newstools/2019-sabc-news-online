The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Communications Committee in Parliament has welcomed and supported newly elected committee chairperson Hope Papo. This is in contrast to the party’s objection to various committee chairpersons who were elected in other committees. Papo was elected unopposed by all parties on the first day of the establishment of the committee. DA Member of the Committee Phumzile van Damme expressed her sentiments soon after Papo took over the chair following his election. She said, “I would like to congratulate you on your nomination as chair. I look forward to working with the committee. And then last term we had a committee that worked very well together. And I hope we can continue that. I think at most times we put our political differences aside. And we did what’s best for the country and what’s best for the department and the people of South Africa. So I look forward to working with all of you.”
