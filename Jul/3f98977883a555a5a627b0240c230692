President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Sunday at 6pm respond to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s finding that he deliberately misled Parliament on the R500 000 donation received from Bosasa for his 2017 ANC Presidency campaign. In a report, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa had violated the Executive Members Ethics Code and has called for him to be disciplined by Parliament. Report Below:  The President is expected to announce whether he will take the Public Protector’s report on judicial review. It is likely that Ramaphosa will reiterate the statements he presented to Mkhwebane in response to her preliminary report on the matter. Ramaphosa has said that he did not know about the Bosasa donation at the time of answering in Parliament as there had been an agreement with the CR17 campaign managers that they would not disclose the identities of funders. Additionally, Mkhwebane’s investigation is unlawful as the scope of her work concerns the improper exercise of public powers – an area that does not relate to the funding operations of the CR17 campaign. The President has also asserted that he has not violated the Executive Member’s Ethics Code as he did not have any personal claim or say over the donations received.
