The Eastern Cape Education Department has condemned the downing of tools by teachers at St Matthews High School in Keiskammahoek. There has been no teaching and learning at the school for a week. Teachers are demanding that suspended teachers be allowed to return to work. The five staff members, including the principal, who were suspended by the Education Department, are implicated in a sex-for-marks scandal. Learners took to the streets on Thursday demanding to be taught. Education spokesperson, Malibongwe Mtima says they do not condone the protest. “We are making a plight to everyone to say we do not condone a protest, a mass protest relating to this by protesting on this matter. It means there are two ways. It means that the educators are promoting this of which we are aware that they can’t be doing that, knowing what the implications are. Hence we sent the people to sit down with them and remind them of what is important,” says Mtima. Learners at the school are adamant that they do not want the suspended teachers back. “We as learners, we don’t want them back. That is why we did the protest and now it affects us in classes because they don’t teach.” “The teachers haven’t given us feedback after they took their decision and we saw the teachers that are accused, one of them is back,” the learners say.
