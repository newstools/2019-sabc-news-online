The Minister of Science and Technology, Blade Nzimande will launch the National Science Week at the Mittah Seperepere Conversation Centre in Kimberley, on Saturday. The launch is in partnership with the Northern Cape Department of Basic Education and the South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement (SAASTA). Over 2000 learners from the Northern Cape are expected to attend and exhibit their science innovations during the course of the week. Nzimande says it’s a week to shift South Africa’s focus on science and innovation. “We are also focusing on the uses of science and innovation in many areas. Our primary target is our learners. One of the big challenges, we have in South Africa, is the fear of maths and science. We want to use this week to show that science can be fun,” says Nzimande. He says the event will also take place in other districts around South Africa.
