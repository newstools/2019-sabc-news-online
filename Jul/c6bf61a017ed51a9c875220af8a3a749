The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has placed three key executives on precautionary suspension and extended the suspension of another executive pending the finalisation of a disciplinary process over serious allegations of misconduct. This is part of an ongoing comprehensive review of the whole Sars leadership by Commissioner Edward Kieswetter. It is in response to the report on the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by Sars, namely the Nugent Report. In a statement, Sars says the precautionary suspensions take effect immediately. It further says suspensions are precautionary in nature and as such do not amount to findings of any wrongdoing on their part. Sars requests that the privacy of the individuals concerned and the confidentiality of the employer-employee relationship be respected. The Sars Executives on suspension are Chief Officer Governance, International Relations Hlengani Mathebula; Chief Officer Human Capital & DevelopmentÂ  Teboho Mokoena, and Group Executive Employee Relations Luther Lebelo.
