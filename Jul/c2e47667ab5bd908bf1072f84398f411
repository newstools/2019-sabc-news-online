Eastern Cape MEC for Rural Development Nomakhosazana Meth says the Magwa-Majola Tea Estate in Lusikisiki  has the potential to contribute immensely to the economy of the province. An investment of R33.9 million has been made as part of the rescue plan to keep the estate producing and packaging quality tea for both local and international markets. Meth says since the rescue process, a total of 660 hectares of tea plantation has been revitalized and is in production, leading to retention of about 2 000 jobs. “We want to go all over the province and outside the province to suppliers of the tea because our tea is a good tea, it has been tested,  it is approved. We are saying we must invest more energy in working with the people of this place to ensure that we expand , to ensure that our government also puts more financial injection, that is what will make us where we want to be, our potential is to attract investors,” says the MEC. Meanwhile, Eastern Cape Rural Development Agency CEO, Nhlanganiso Dladla says complimentary commodities such as cannabis, avocados and macadamia nuts will also be introduced to boost eco and Agri-tourism in the Magwa- Majola Tea Estate. “We are also envisaging the introduction of high daily commodities in the area such as avocados, macadamia nuts and cannabis that is breaking into our economy, more formally. You will remember now that this region is renowned for growing this commodity for a long time, so now it is considered as illegal.”
