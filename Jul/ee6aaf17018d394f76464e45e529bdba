Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa was in breach of the executive code of ethics and misled Parliament in relation to a 2017 Bosasa donation. Mkhwebane was probing allegations that Ramaphosa lied to Parliament about a campaign donation of R500 000 by Bosasa. The complaint was laid by Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Deputy President Floyd Shivambu and a whistle-blower. “To the question on whether the president improperly and in violation of the constitution and the code exposed himself to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between his official duties and his private interest, it is common cause that the payment of R500 000 was made into the trust account towards the CR17 campaign in October 2017. It is also not in dispute that he president’s son had business contracts for which he was paid large sums of money for the services he rendered,” says Mkhwebane. Watch the stream below:
