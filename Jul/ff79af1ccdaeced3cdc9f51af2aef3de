The City of Cape Town says its by-laws are applicable to all of its residents, including the homeless. This comes after the City started issuing fines to homeless people for obstructing pavements and erecting shelters in undesignated areas. The fines range from R300 to R1 500. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says they’ve received complaints from various areas. “We are treating homeless people the same as we treat all other citizens in South Africa. We issue thousands of fines every month to citizens in the city. Homeless people make up a tiny fraction of that number of fines, but they will have to abide by the by-laws as everybody else. “The City will continue against the backdrop of this to make sure that we offer every other kind of social assistance, because there is no homeless person on our streets that has not been offered alternative accommodation,” adds JP Smith.
