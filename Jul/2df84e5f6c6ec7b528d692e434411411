The murder case against Newcastle mayor, doctor Nthuthuko Mahlaba, has been postponed to the August 15 in the Madadeni Magistrateâ€™s Court. This is to allow both the state and defence to make representations to the director of public prosecution. Mahlaba appeared calm and collected during his court appearance on charges connected to the murder of ANC Youth League member Wandile Ngobeni in 2016. More than 100 people supported Mahlaba outside court. They sang struggle songs and held placards calling for him to remain in office. Mahlaba said after his court appearance that his lawyers submitted documents supporting his allegation that the case against him has been fabricated. WATCH BELOW:
