The Congress of the People (COPE) has launched a constituency at the University of Fort Hare in the Eastern Cape. COPE President Mosiuoa Lekota addressed the students at the launch of the new branch. The party already has student representation in five other institutions in the country. Lekota says the party will launch student branches at more academic institutions. He says: “I have been invited by local students who are supporting COPE. They are expanding the branch of COPE. So I am talking to them about COPE and their role in the South African society in future.” “They are very enthusiastic about the party and they want to rebuild the party from the ground,” adds Lekota.
