The Freedom Front Plus says the latest unemployment figures show that the African National Congress (ANC)-led government does not have the political will to stabilise the country’s economy. The party was reacting to the announcement made on Tuesday that unemployment had risen to an 11-year high; from 27.6% to 29% in the second quarter of 2019. Statistics South Africa released its Quarterly Labour Force Survey, recording the highest unemployment rate since 2003. The Eastern Cape has more than a third of eligible workers out of a job.   The FF Plus says BEE and affirmative action must be halted. “The ANC government does not have the political will to strengthen the country’s economy and enable the private sector to contribute to job creation. Strict and prescriptive labour legislation and incorrect policy directions are definitely to blame. BEE and affirmative action and policy directions that negatively affect the economy must stop.” Unemployment in South Africa a ticking timebomb #UnemploymentRate @VFPlus : https://t.co/enzZ2BvAJR — VRYHEIDSFRONT PLUS / FREEDOM FRONT PLUS (@VFPlus) July 30, 2019  Meanwhile, the ANC has expressed concern over the latest unemployment figures.
