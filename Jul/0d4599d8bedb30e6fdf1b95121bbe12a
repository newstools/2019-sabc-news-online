Parents who’ve applied online for their children to be placed in grades 1 and 8 next year have until two o’clock this afternoon to submit all outstanding documents to the schools they’ve applied to. No school placement offers will be granted if such documents are outstanding. The Gauteng Online admission applications closed on July, 22nd. But the provincial Education Department extended the deadline for the consideration of documents after they discovered last week that over 60 000 of the more than 298 000 applicants had not submitted the required supporting documents to schools. The department’s Steve Mabona says no extensions for submissions will be given… “Today (Wednesday) is the last day. At two o’ clock, the schools will be closing the process of accepting the documents that are required. We want to put an emphasis that no extension for submission of documents will be granted.”
