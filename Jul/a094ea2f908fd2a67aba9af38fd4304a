Northern Cape Premier Dr Zamani Saul‘s maiden State of the Province Address on Friday is expected to cost at least R1.1 million less than that of his predecessor. The address has been billed as a no frills affair with no red carpet, no decor and standard pre-packed catering for the 3000 guests. “There will be no VIP treatment. All of us will be guests. All guests and members of the legislature are expected to have the same menu. We are all on an equal basis here. Our premier has set the tone and the stance that there will be no frills,” says Speaker of the Northern Cape legislature, Newrene Klaaste. The new Premier visited an old age home in Kimberley on Thursday where he addressed residents. The Chairperson of the Older Persons Forum in the Northern Cape, Kgositsile Letselebe urged him to establish an older persons’ desk in the premier’s office and an older persons’ legislature. “In the Parliament and in the desk, most of our issues can be raised and then the Premier would have first-hand information about what is happening on the ground and what is happening with the older persons.”
