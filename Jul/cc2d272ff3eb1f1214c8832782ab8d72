#FeesMustFall leader Mcebo Dlamini‘s pre-trial conference has been postponed to the 22 July in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. Dlamini is facing a string of charges including public violence, assault, theft and damage to property. He was arrested at his Wits University residence in October 2016, during the protests for free higher education. Dlamini was initially denied bail but the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court overturned the decision. He appeared briefly in the dock, before his pre-trial conference was postponed to later in the month, pending the outcome of the review of the National Director of Public Prosecutions’ (NDPP) decision not to withdraw the charges against him. Earlier this year, Dlamini applied to the NDPP to have his charges dropped because he felt that they were politically motivated, for the role he played in the FeesMustFall protests. After his appearance on Thursday, Dlamini said he is hoping for the matter to be concluded soon, as he has already made more than 30 court appearances. He is now being represented by Advocate Dali Mpofu.
