Police fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd, attempting to force its way through the gates of the Dr J S Moroka Council Chamber in Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga earlier on Friday. A crowd opposed to the expected suspension of the municipal manager, gathered at the council’s gate ahead of a meeting on Friday. They do not want him suspended, claiming he’s done a lot to fight corruption since being appointed. Chaos broke out when a delegation of traditional leaders arrived for the meeting but were denied entry by private security officials. Some of the residents threw stones at the security officers who retaliated. Police officers fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowds, many of whom have returned to await the commencement of the meeting.
