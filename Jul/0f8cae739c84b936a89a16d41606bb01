Calls for Northern Cape Premier, Dr Zamani Saul to declare the province a drought disaster area, are intensifying. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and organised agriculture have described the situation as a crisis. It’s estimated that more than R600 million is needed to sustain farmers until December. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says this issue needs to be addressed to ensure that no job losses are incurred. “What we are calling for is a full coordinated plan, not only to deal with the effects of the drought but the subsequent consequences such as how do we ensure we stem job losses, how do we ensure there’s a disaster management plan and those things must be put in place.” It’s considered the worst drought in a century – five years of below average rainfall in large parts of the province has farmers on their knees. Almost 6 million hectares of grazing land are affected. The impact is felt beyond farms 62 000 workers could lose their jobs. Three of the five municipal districts are officially disaster areas. The agriculture sector says the entire province needs to be declared a disaster area so that much-needed funds can be released by the national government.  Agri Northern Cape, CEO Henning Myburgh says some serious action is needed to avert the drought. “It’s a crisis. The economy of the Northern Cape platteland areas rural areas depend on the farming sector; and at this moment it is collapsing. So some serious action is needed,” says Myburgh. The provincial agriculture department says it’s in the process of applying for a disaster declaration. R27 million has already been used in the last financial year to assist 2 300 farmers. It’s also supplying fodder. Farmers say that even if the drought is broken soon, they will need at least five years of normal rainfall to recover.
