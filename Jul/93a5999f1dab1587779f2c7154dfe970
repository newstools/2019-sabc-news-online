Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu says Cabinet has expressed concerns at the state of public finances following the recent Auditor General’s report on the local government audits for the 2017/18 financial year. Last month, Auditor- General Kimi Makwetu announced that irregular expenditure among municipalities amounted to R 25 billion and that 239 out of 257 municipalities did not receive clean audits. Mthembu was briefing the media at Parliament on the outcomes of the recently held Cabinet meeting. He says, “The Auditor-General has all the powers to work and refer other matters to law enforcement authorities but particularly where monies have been looted. The Auditor-General has that power, he can refer such matters of criminality to other law enforcement agencies. Secondly, the Auditor-General can demand that those responsible pay back the money, heads must roll on those who continue to spend fruitlessly, spend wastefully and spend irregularly.” Click below to watch the Post Cabinet briefing.
