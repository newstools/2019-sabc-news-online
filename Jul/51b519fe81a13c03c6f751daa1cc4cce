President Cyril Ramaphosa says national and provincial governments will have to meet more regularly to improve service delivery. He reiterated that the sixth administration will introduce a district-based approach for better coordination. Ramaphosa presented the Presidency’s budget vote in Parliament on Wednesday. The President acknowledged that the previous administration caused policy uncertainty with frequent Cabinet reshuffles. He also reiterated that state owned companies would be cleaned up. The President says the youth will be at the centre of government’s job creation and inclusive growth plans.  Political parties have also reacted to the President’s budget vote, focusing on the economy, land, the spat between the EFF and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, as well as clean governance. ‘Set the record straight’ DA leader Mmusi Maimane has challenged President Ramaphosa to appear before the State Capture Commission to set the record straight following revelations made by his predecessor Jacob Zuma. He also told the President to assure that he pays his own legal fees if Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s investigation goes against him. “Mr Zuma’s testimony is either that of a deranged individual or someone who is telling the truth. In Zuma’s own words, he says the nine wasted years there were many who are sitting here who were party to those decisions during those nine years. In fact, he says it was the deployment committee which you headed up … So all I want to know, and you were silent then, will you be silent now or will you take action and guarantee this House tomorrow when you will come to respond that you will go to the Commission and set the record straight for all South Africans?” -Additional reporting by Mercedes Bessent
