Former Public Investment Corporation (PIC) CEO Dan Matjila has testified before the judicial commission of inquiry into the Corporation, in Pretoria. Former PIC executive managers and staff have accused Matjila of misuse of funds, intimidation, corruption, and careless investment decisions taken at the Corporation during his tenor. He is alleged to have run havoc at the Corporation, ruling it with an iron fist, together with former CFO Motshepi More. His testimony will be released this week in tranches. Parts of his testimony was leaked to the media and Justice Lex Mpati says he was concerned Matjilaâ€™s testimony was leaked before he could testify. Matjila was CEO of the PIC from 2014 to 2018.
