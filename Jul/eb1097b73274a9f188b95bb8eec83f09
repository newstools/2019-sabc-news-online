A California teenager was identified by police on Monday as the gunman who killed three people, including two children, at a food festival south of San Francisco. “It could have gone so much worse so fast,” Smithee said, noting the festival, which takes place about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Silicon Valley, America’s tech hub, welcomes thousands of visitors. Police were still trying to determine the motive. They were also investigating unconfirmed reports by eyewitnesses that Legan may have had an accomplice. Legan killed a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s, Smithee said. Police believe Legan purchased the rifle legally in Nevada on July 9, Smithee said. Twelve people were injured, but it was unclear how many were shot or otherwise hurt in the crush of bystanders trying to flee, according to police. Police had previously said that 15 people were injured. One person was in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. President Donald Trump described the gunman as a “wicked murderer” and asked people to pray for the victims during an event at the White House. “We grieve for their families, and we ask that God will comfort them with his overflowing mercy and grace,” he said.
