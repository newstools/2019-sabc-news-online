The appointment of incompetent and unsuitably qualified senior municipal officials is attributed as the reason for   poor financial audit outcomes in some of the North West municipalities. All the 22 municipalities in the province have not obtained clean audits for the 2017/18 financial year. This was revealed by the recent report by the Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu. Former provincial head of department of local government, Advocate Johnny Motlogelwa, says, “The challenge affecting the municipalities is the irregular and inappropriate appointment of senior managers.” “Some appointments are now yielding the results. Poor negative audit outcomes, lack of basic service delivery, poor management and administration in municipalities [are] as a result of the inability of the political leadership to appoint appropriately qualified and experience [people]. But also, senior municipal managers must have a proper track record and a good background,” explains Motlogelwa. Click below for related video….
