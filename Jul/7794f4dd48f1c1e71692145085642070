The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) can elect its own leadership. After years of political infighting, which led to the loss of support and securing just one seat in Parliament, factions in the PAC are at it again. One faction, led by Mzwanele Nyontsho, has won a court battle against Narius Moloto. Moloto invoked the PAC constitution in June wherein he sought to run the party by decree. Partyâ€™s Secretary Apa Pooe says they are ready to hold a national congress to elect new leadership.
