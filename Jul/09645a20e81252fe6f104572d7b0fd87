About 25 people have been arrested for public vigilance since yesterday #Taxistrike#sabcnews#sabcfs pic.twitter.com/4GLa46UrlS — Aphumelele Mdlalane (@AphumeleleMdla2) July 24, 2019  The association met with Interstate Bus Lines and the provincial Police, Roads and Transport Department on Friday to discuss grievances of members that led to the strike. The GBTA is complaining that traffic officials harass its members and that buses operate on its  routes illegally.  Interstate Bus Lines has since refuted the claims but has welcomed a probe into its operations. Authorities are hopeful that the stakeholders’ meeting will come up with a solution. Police, Roads and Transport Department Head Sipho Mtakathi says they will continue to take strong action against those who do not respect the law. Meanwhile, 40 people who were arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property during this week’s taxi strike in Bloemfontein have been released. 18 of the arrested taxi drivers were granted free bail while 22 were released on R500 bail each.
