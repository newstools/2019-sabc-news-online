The Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen, on Thursday spent his 67 minutes for Nelson Mandela Day cooking soup for the homeless with Ladles of Love. Ladles of Love is a community project dedicated to feeding those who are hungry, with soup kitchens across Cape Town and various other projects providing food to disadvantaged schools, students and communities. Further, the DA’s members of Parliament in the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces collected and donated goods for The Homestead. The Homestead has various projects aimed at providing for the needs of street children, including a drop-in centre and shelters in Khayelitsha and Manenberg. The DA believes that Nelson Mandela Day provides an opportunity for South Africans to come together in the spirit of ubuntu and reach out to make a difference in each others’ lives. DA Mpumalanga leader, Jane Sithole says Nelson Mandela Day is all about giving what you had. She, staff and DA activists contributed to Nelson Mandela Day by cleaning at St Joseph Care Village in Middelburg. The village is a home for children with special needs and orphans. “One doesn’t necessarily need money to help the next person. You can participate by giving your labour, giving your care and relieve those who are in need of help.”
