President Cyril Ramaphosa has encouraged the youth to emulate late struggle stalwart and military veteran Isaac ‘Bra Ike’ Maphoto, saying it is important to overcome the ills of society. The 88-year-old passed away last weekend after a long illness. Ramaphosa delivered the eulogy during the special official funeral service at Polokwane cricket stadium in Limpopo. He says. “Let us emulate his commitment and love to education. In bidding farewell to a giant of the liberation struggle, I call on all our people especially the youth to pick up the spear that has fallen. Theirs was a battle against the forces of racism. Let us strive and fight with equal measure to overcome the ills of our society today. We must emulate his example of humility and voluntarism.” Click on the video below:
