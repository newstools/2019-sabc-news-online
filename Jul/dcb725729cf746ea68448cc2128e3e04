A 41 year-old man is expected to appear in the Bray Magistrates’ Court in the North West, on a charge of murder. The suspect was arrested following the discovery of the decomposed body of his 35 year-old girlfriend, Makinyane Sata, on a farm near Matloding village. Sata’s body was exhumed on Tuesday by police forensic experts in a shallow grave, allegedly after her boyfriend killed her. The victim was allegedly last seen with the suspect two weeks ago and was reported missing over the weekend. The suspect led community members to her grave late on Monday night.
