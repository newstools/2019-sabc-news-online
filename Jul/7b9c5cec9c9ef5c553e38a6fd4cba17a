Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has urged law enforcement officers to show zero tolerance for lawlessness. He was speaking at a roadblock on the N3 Highway, near Heidelberg in Gauteng, ahead of Saturday’s Durban July. The annual horse racing event attracts thousands of people with many of them driving to the coast. Mbalula says unroadworthy vehicles should be impounded and drunk drivers must be arrested. “This weekend many of our people will be descending to KwaZulu-Natal in what is well known and called the July Handicap. When you wear that badge, wear it with a responsibility to maintain law and order and maintain the authority of the state in ensuring that these roads are safe.”
