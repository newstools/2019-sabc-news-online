A public participation process to rename a historical street in Cape Town, will kick off this July. This follows a proposal by the District Six Working Committee to rename Keizergracht to its historical name of Hanover Street. The street was the commercial hub which connected residents and businesses from District Six directly to the CBD. It was renamed Keizergracht after the forced removal of thousands of people under the Group Areas Act from the area to the Cape Flats. The District Six Working Committee is proposing that it be renamed on Heritage day in September. Mayor, Dan Plato, says a public participation process will take place between the 15th and the 26th of July. “As a responsible government we need to follow a due process as required by laws of the country and also by policy. I want to ask the community of District six, wherever they might live please take part in the process,” says Plato. Watch a related video below:
