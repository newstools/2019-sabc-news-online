The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the eThekwini municipality has lodged its intention to table a motion to remove Mayor Zandile Gumede as a member of the Executive Committee at the next council meeting. Gumede was asked by her party, the African National Congress (ANC) to take a special leave after she was arrested in connection with the R208 million Durban solid waste tender. She is facing charges of fraud and corruption and is out on R50 000 bail. Earlier this month the ANC announced that it had extended Gumede’s leave. The DA’s eThekwini caucus leader Nicole Graham says the municipality has crumbled under Gumede’s leadership. “Since 2016, we have seen the levels of basic service, we’ve seen the administration of this municipality has been brought into chaos by the leadership of Zandile Gumede. Basic services have been politicised and the DSW case for which Zandile and others have been arrested in clearly indicative of that. I think that’s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what’s been happening here.”
