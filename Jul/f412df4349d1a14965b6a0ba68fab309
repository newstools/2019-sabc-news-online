The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has confirmed that teaching and learning are continuing as normal at its campuses. This follows an alleged clash between campus security and students during a protest on both the Howard and Westville Campuses. UKZN spokesperson Ashton Bodrick says students have been protesting over marks that they are not satisfied with. He says university management is holding talks with the student leadership to resolve the concerns. “We are actually in discussion with the SRC members about all those issues. We should have a resolution probably tomorrow or latest Friday. There was a handful of students who did try to protest, but fortunately we already had security on standby and the police who contained the situation favourably. No harm came to any student. There is still lectures tomorrow we feel that it is very key that students do attend their lectures,” explains Bodrick.
