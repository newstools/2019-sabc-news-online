Freedom Front Plus Leader Pieter Groenewald says Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane should be vigilant by ensuring that the intelligence structures do not deliberately feed her misleading information. Groenewald was reacting to the latest findings and remedial action by Mkhwebane against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Mkhwebane found that Gordhan deliberately misled Parliament by failing to disclose that he had a meeting with one of the Gupta family members and associates in 2012. She also found that the Minister violated the constitution when he ratified the creation of the so-called ‘rogue unit’ when he was still SARS Commissioner. Groenewald says Mkhwebane is within her right to request information from the intelligence agencies when she conducts her investigations, but that she should carefully scrutinise the information. “The question is whether the information given to the Public Protector is correct. We must know that the intelligence institutions are well known for the fact that they are completely part of the factional infighting of the ANC. It started with Zuma and we know that there was quite a lot of false information given – even to journalists. Therefore, we say that she must be very careful just to accept that information from the intelligence (whether) it’s correct. She should verify that and make very-very sure that it is correct information.” Click related video below:
