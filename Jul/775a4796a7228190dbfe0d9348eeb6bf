The EFF at the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality in Qwaqwa has vowed to ensure that those involved in corruption are prosecuted. Two main oppositions in the council, the EFF and the DA, boycotted the council sitting meant to pass the budget. Now the DA wants to challenge the legality of that meeting. Opposition parties on numerous occasions called for the dissolution of the council over allegations of maladministration and corruption. The ANC’s Lakaje Mosia says the party is happy with the councillors of the municipality. “We are very happy as the councillors of Maluti-A-Phofung to pass the budget for the interest of the community.” The EFF’s Mohau Molwelwe is crying foul. “The manner in which they passed the budget did not follow the due processes. They did not consult the community. So there was no sufficient public participation from Maluti-A-Phofung.” The cash strapped municipality has experienced challenges of delivering quality services. Free State MEC, Thembeni Nxangisa, says that this is a milestone budget. “This is a milestone budget and it’s a beginning of many things to come. The community is going to benefit. There will be services.” Last week SAMWU were opposed to the budget and were not available for comment. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
