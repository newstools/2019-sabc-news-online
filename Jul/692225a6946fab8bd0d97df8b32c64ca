The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has withdrawn racketeering charges against former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss, Johan Booysen and former Cator Manor detectives. Booysen was charged by the former acting NPA head, Advocate Nomcobo Jiba back in 2012. Booysen and his co-accused had always maintained that the charges were invalid. NPA spokesperson, Bulelwa Makeke says a panel reviewed the charges and found them to be invalid. “The National Director Advocate, Shamila Batohi was faced with a high court application that she had to respond to on  behalf of the NPA. She put together a panel, the panel reviewed all the material that would have been presented to the two former NDPP directors, they unanimously made a recommendation to the national director that the information that is available before them doesn’t warrant the authorisation of this racketeering offences.”
