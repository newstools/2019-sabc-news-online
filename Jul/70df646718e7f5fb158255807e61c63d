The Speaker of the Joburg Metro Vasco da Gama says they can’t rule out the possibility of an inside job in an incident in which the offices of the Chief Whip were broken into. The Johannesburg Metro Police say at this stage it’s not clear which documents have been taken following the incident. The JPMD says it is offering a R25 000 rewards for any information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of a man believed to be behind the break-in. The investigation has been handed over to the police and the Group Forensic and Investigation Service of the City of Johannesburg. Da Gama says what happened on Saturday is a serious concern. “For anybody to access my office or the Mayor’s or any of the political offices whether it’s ANC, DA or EFF or any of the smaller parties, it is a concern because obviously at some point these officials do deal with sensitive information. If laptops are stolen or any of the electronic equipment that we use, it’s a concern because we store a lot of data.” Watch video below for more on the story:
