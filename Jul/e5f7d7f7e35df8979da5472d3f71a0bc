Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will be in the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday over the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebaneâ€˜s report on the so-called rogue unit at the South Africa Revenue Service. Gordhan wants the court to interdict the remedial action contained in the report until a judicial review has been completed. He has denied that the intelligence team set up investigate tax evasion was a rogue unit. In a report released last week Mkhwebane found that the establishment of the unit was unlawful and that Gordhan who was South African Revenue Service commissioner at the time, had violated the constitution. She also gave President Cyril Ramaphosa 30 days to take action against Gordhan for violating the constitution and the executive ethics code.
