The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) is to check on the beaches of Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape on Monday to see if there has been any damage from the oil spill. SAMSA aims to establish how the spill happened. It is estimated that between 200 and 400 litres of ship fuel oil spilled into the bay during an offshore ship refuelling on Saturday morning. Acting CEO Sobantu Tilayi says, “We do not know what the cause of the overflow was but we are going to investigate the oil-spill when this usually happens all role players including environmentalists come together to look at what the impact is so we will make sure this doesn’t happen again.” Watch related video below:
