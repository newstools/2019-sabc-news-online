The late African National Congress (ANC) Secretary in the Mogalakwena sub-region, Ralph Kanyane, who was shot and killed last week, is expected to be laid to rest at his home village of Vanwykspan in Limpopo on Sunday morning. Kanyane and ANC Councillor Valtyn Kekana were ambushed and shot by an unknown man while sitting inside a car in the Mokopane CBD on Tuesday afternoon.  Kekana was allegedly a whistleblower on allegations of fraud and corruption by municipal employees. Two years ago, another whistleblower Piet Pale was shot and killed. Kekana will be buried next week. No one has been arrested yet in connection with the murders.
