Workers at the cash-strapped Amahlathi Municipality based at Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape have finally received their salaries after waiting for two months. The municipality, which was placed under administration, has been battling maladministration issues that led to violent protests last year. The administrator, Dr Sindisile Maclean, says even though they were able to pay the salaries, the municipality still faces financial challenges. “It’s a long term but we are looking forward to that and I am sure after a few months it will stabilize. We are also looking at other options. We have approached old people who can retire early so that we reduce the number of the personnel. Once we do that and we also look at the high allowances of managers and cut them and do all these cost cutting measures, we will stabilise,” explains Maclean.
