Pregnant women in Limpopo have had to buy some pregnancy supplements due to shortages at public health institutions in the province. These include ferrous sulphate which is taken daily throughout pregnancy to prevent low blood levels. Ferrous sulphate is also used to supplement blood production and prevent haemorrhaging, which is loss of blood that can lead to maternal death. A patient at Rethabile Health Centre in Polokwane says she has been affected by the shortages. “I go to Rethabile Health Centre so in terms of supplements, there’s usually a shortage; they usually advise us to buy. They give us what it is there. It is expensive, but I have to buy in order not to default in medication so that’s what I have to do. I remember only getting my supplements only twice and I have been going there for a very long time; about 6 months, 7 months.” Limpopo Health department spokesperson, Neil Shikwambana, says they are providing substitute supplements to the pregnant women. “The problem stems from the fact that the companies that supplies that medication are struggling to supply it to us. So that means that the whole province has not been receiving that from the suppliers, but it’s not a train smash because we are using pregmal as a substitute. The issue of maternal death or children that die during birth, is one of our key government areas. So we make sure that once we have challenges in that state, we cover it quickly because it’s one of our focus areas.”
