Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says progress has been made in the process of engagement regarding the controversial e-tolls in Gauteng. He was addressing the 38th annual Southern African Transport Conference in Pretoria. Mbalula’s statement follows the spat on social media between Gauteng Infrastructure Development and Property Management MEC Tasneem Motara, Premier David Makhura and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on e-tolls. Mbalula says the country will know government’s decision on the matter early next month. “It’s a hard debate. It’s robust. Treasury is hard on the discussion because of what they are confronted with. Even our entities SANRAL and so on because they’ve got to have the capacity to borrow. They can’t borrow anymore. It affects our rating capacity and the rating agencies and how they look into South Africa. So these are issues that we are interrogating in terms of looking at the solution and the demand on the table. So in August you will get a comprehensive response to that,” explains Mbalula.
