President Cyril Ramaphosa has reacted to the Twitter dispute on Gauteng e-tolls by saying he wants the issue solved and has mandated Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to work with Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Gauteng Premier David Makhura. President Ramaphosa says they must table proposals on a solution to Cabinet by the end of August. The President also expressed his concern at the Twitter spat between Makhura and Mboweni, saying they “are unbecoming of their high offices”. While the President reiterated that the user-pay principle remains government policy, he admits Gauteng’s e-toll system “presents challenges in its current form”.
