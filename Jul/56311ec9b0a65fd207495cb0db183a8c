The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) wants Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to be removed from cabinet and for President Cyril Ramaphosa to take the Public Protector’s remedial against Gordhan seriously. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the revelations by the Public Protector on Gordhan’s alleged involvement in the so-called SARS “rogue unit” is tantamount to treason. In one of the findings against Gordhan Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Gordhan violated the constitution when he ratified the creation of the unit when he was still SARS Commissioner. The unit was established to probe movements which include activities of tax evaders. Ndlozi says Ramaphosa must act. “We call on Ramaphosa to act on the remedial action that Gordhan must face the full might of the law. He must be subjected to discipline but also the South African Police Services must comply with immediate effect and institute a criminal investigation against Gordhan as well as on all other gang members of the rogue unit.” “Essentially Ramaphosa must remove Gordhan from the cabinet. Gordhan has to be removed from exercising any power in a democratic state on behalf of our people, because what he did within SARS, establishing the rogue unit amounts to abuse of power and is tantamount to treason which is the highest betrayal of the constitution and the people of South Africa.” Click video below:  Meanwhile the Inkatha Freedom Party says the remedial action recommended by Public Protector against Public Enterprises Minister is a constitutional test for both Parliament and President Cyril Ramaphosa. The IFP says while it’s mindful of the tension between Gordhan and Mkhwebane, the constitutional principles have to be applied consistently. More analysis on the Public Protector’s report:
