The 16 African National Congress (ANC) councillors who were sacked by the party’s Free State structure last year say they are confident that the ANC NEC will address their concerns. The councillors held a meeting with member of the party’s NEC member David Mahlobo at the weekend, with the hope of finding solutions to their concerns. The councillors from the Maluti a Phofung Municipality in Qwaqwa, were fired following allegations that they had voted with opposition parties to oust former mayor Vusi Tshabalala. One of the former councillors, Shashapa Motaung says they want their jobs back. “We haven’t sat with an NEC to state our side. So we are very confident with the information that we gave them that we are going to win this case. We also propose to them that we cannot run two parallel programmes. We are negotiating so we cannot have By Elections,” explains Motaung.
