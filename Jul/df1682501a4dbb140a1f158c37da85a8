There were tears and jubilation in Bloemfontein when the SANDF welcomed a troop contingent back from the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo. The mission is sanctioned by the United Nations as part of peacekeeping operations. About 800 SANDF soldiers were deployed to the United Nations sanctioned mission as part of an intervention force in the Democratic Republic of Congo from June 2018 to July 2019. SANDF’s Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi has congratulated the soldiers for a job well done. The Chief of the SANDF General Solly Shoke also paid tribute to the members for what he called their selfless contribution to peace. 29 old Corporal Phindile Ndlovu is one of 800 SANDF soldiers who successfully fought off ambushes by rebel groups. The single mother of two children has been in the defence force for the past eight years. “Everything went well, even though some other time it was hectic. Social workers were there to assist.” Another group of soldiers was sent to the DRC in June. Major General Thabiso Mokhosi says the soldiers displayed good prowess despite challenges. “There have been attacks in the villages, but I can confirm our soldiers displayed a good prowess their military skills.” The soldiers will now follow a program to be integrated with their families and communities.
