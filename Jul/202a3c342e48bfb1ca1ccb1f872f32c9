President Cyril Ramaphosa and Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane have applauded an outstanding achievement by Retired Justice Dikgang Moseneke in bringing all Lesotho stakeholders to recommit to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Reform Process. The country has experienced political instability which is threatening the existence of the coalition government.  The President visited Lesotho and also held bilateral talks with Prime Minister Thabane with the aim of strengthening relations between the two countries. This is the first visit for President Ramaphosa since assuming the highest office in South Africa. First stop was at the Royal House in Maseru, paying a courtesy visit to His Majesty King Letsie III, then a bilateral meeting with the head of governmentÂ Prime Minister Thomas Thabane. A long journey by both President Ramaphosa and Retired Justice Dikgang Moseneke has finally yielded results that will firmly put Lesotho into a path of lasting peace and stability. However, the Prime Minister is not off the hook yet. Ahead of SADC Summit in Tanzania, President Ramaphosa and the Prime Minister can count on a positive progress made in steering the troubled Mountain Kingdom of Lesotho to lasting-peace and stability.
