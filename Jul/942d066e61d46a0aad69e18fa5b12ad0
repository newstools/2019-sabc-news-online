The Presidency says Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane does not have the jurisdiction to investigate the CR17 campaign and make any findings in relation to it. In a statement, the presidency describes the investigation into the 2017 election campaign for the ANC leadership as unlawful. This is in response to Mkhwebane’s findings that President Cyril Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament about a R500 000 donation received for his election campaign. The DA and EFF laid the initial complaints that the President had violated the executive ethics code after the donation was made to Ramaphosa’s son, Andile, by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. Last November, Ramaphosa told Parliament that the money was obtained legally for the services his son provided, but he later said the payment was a donation towards his campaign. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko says Ramaphosa maintains he did not initially know of the route in which the money had ended up with the CR17 campaign. Diko says: “Our Constitution allows for anybody who feels that they have a dispute that can be resolved by approaching a court to do so.” “So once the President has looked at the report and compared it with the issues that he raised and looked at new issues that Mkhwebane raised in the final report, he may take a decision to take the report on review.”
