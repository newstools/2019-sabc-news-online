Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says he’s not intimidated by the actions of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). This is after the party’s MPs tried to prevent Gordhan from delivering his department’s budget vote speech in Parliament on Thursday night, and they were ordered to leave the House. Some parties are calling for Parliament to take action against the MPs involved. Gordhan continued with his speech after the EFF was removed from the House by Parliament security. “What you’ve witnessed is a defence of state capture, because one must ask, what it is that motivates ordinary members of parliament, whichever party they come from, to engage in such intimidatory tactics… and we must ask,  what do they have to hide?  What are they guilty of? What is it that they don’t want to be locked behind bars for… because intimidation of this kind is not going to intimidate me.” Watch for more:
