The Department of Correctional Services has suspended its Senior Corporate Affairs Manager at Durban’s Westville Prison, Dunraj Mohan. This follows the circulation of a cellphone video showing prisoners and warders allegedly snorting what appears to be cocaine, and smoking other drugs inside their jail cells. In a second video, warders are seen handing weapons to prisoners and allegedly encouraging them to fight. “Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Ronald Lamola has been furnished with a preliminary report which suggested that there was a dereliction of duty and or maladministration at the facility. As a result, the National Commissioner has recommended that the senior manager responsible for Corporate Affairs be placed under suspension. “Mr DG Majake has also been appointed the Acting Area Commissioner and is expected to bring about stability and to ensure that the operations run optimally at the centre,” says Correctional Services Spokesperson Chrispin Phiri.
