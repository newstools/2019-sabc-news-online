Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile is expected to meet Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba on Wednesday over the illegal land occupations in Lenasia south of Johannesburg. Mashaba says he’s been shown evidence that proves that a syndicate is behind the illegal land occupations in Lenasia. Maile visited Lenasia over the weekend to call for calm following violent protests. Residents living in bonded houses protested over what they say is the mushrooming of illegal shacks which they say was devaluing their properties. Maile has conceded that government has failed to prevent illegal land occupations before they happen. “We are putting a counter land invasion policy in place as the provincial government. I will be meeting with the mayor of Johannesburg on the Lenasia and other issues. The problem of land invasion is a big problem.”
