The much-anticipated shoals of sardines have arrived at Amanzimtoti, along the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Sharks Board operations Manager, Greg Thompson, says the south coast has been experiencing a lot of sardine activity since the weekend. “There were quite a few attempted nettings and we do know of one net that produces a mixture of sardines and bait fish and then it continued through to Sunday morning. There were four or five nets taken. The price of a crate started off at R1500, but today has been quiet so far. So let’s see what happens today and the rest of the week,” says Thompson. Thompson says shark nets have been removed along the south coast from Ansteys Beach on the Bluff and swimming is not allowed in the area. “The nets have been lifted on the south coast. So we’ve got bathing banned from the Ansteys right through to Scottburg and from the lower coast from Hibberdene to Port Edward. We have got bathing opened at most of those beaches but obviously under life-guard management,” says Thompson.
