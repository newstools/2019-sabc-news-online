Three people, including two firemen, have sustained injuries after a fuel tanker exploded near Worcester’s industrial area early on Wednesday. The blast was apparently caused when the tanker and a light motor vehicle crashed in the vicinity of High Street in the Boland town. The busy road as well as other roads in the area are still closed to traffic. Rescue Manager of Cape Wineland’s Emergency Medical Rescue, John Davids, says fire fighters are still dousing the flames from adjacent buildings that also caught alight during the explosion. Davids says the drivers of the vehicles were unharmed. “Three people that were injured, two firemen with minor injuries and a member of the public that drove through the scene who’s got minor injuries to his hands. We have structural damage to buildings, no flames coming from the wreckage, the fire management is under control, except for smouldering buildings they’re trying to manage.” Watch a related video below:
