Tensions remain high in Ottosdal in North West following violent service delivery protests during which municipal offices and a library were torched. Local government MEC Gordon Kegakilwe had to be whisked away when residents disrupted his address at the local stadium. Community members demanded the release of 14 residents arrested for public violence. Residents remain resolute in their demand for better services. “We want the removal of councillors and mayor also because they are not helping us with anything and we are ready to go to by-elections,” says a disgruntled resident. “The community did not need the MEC. They need the mayor in the flesh so the mayor can come and resolve the issues that we have. We need the immediate removal of councillors and we need the immediate release of our people who were arrested,” adds another The library and offices of the cash-strapped Tswaing local Municipality went up in flames. Local authorities have appealed for calm while a solution is sought. “There are issues that need the municipality to intervene and provincial departments. Some of the issues are not the function of the municipality, like the people want Home Affairs, we need to interact with relevant departments, clinics to operate 24 hours,” says Kegakilwe. Residents arrested on charges of public violence and arson are expected to appear in court on Monday.
