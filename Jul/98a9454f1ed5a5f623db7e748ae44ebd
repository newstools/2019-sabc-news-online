The South African music legend Johnny Clegg will be honoured at a memorial service in Johannesburg on Friday. Clegg died last week Tuesday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.  He was laid to rest during a private ceremony the following day.  Scores of people are expected to attend the memorial service of Johnny Clegg. He has been described as one of the early persons in this country to demonstrate the reality of not only social cohesion but cultural integration. Clegg together with his long-time friend Sipho Mchuni formed the band Juluka in 1969 which has been closely associated with the mass movement against apartheid. The pair blended Zulu rhythms with Western styles and performed in stages across the world. In 1999, Nelson Mandela made a surprise entrance on stage during Cleggâ€™s performance in Germany. Juluka or the white Zulu as he was commonly known, will be remembered for his contribution in this. Click on the video below:
