The controversial Estina Vrede Dairy farm project in the Free State will be under the spotlight this week at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg. The  Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State will give introductory testimony on the farm project that was allocated more than R220-million to help emerging farmers. The DA laid the initial complaint with the Public Protector, alleging that the money meant to benefit the poor was siphoned to companies linked to the politically-connected Gupta family. DA Free State legislature spokesperson, Shelton Mollentze, says the party is confident that the information they have will assist Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. ” In terms of Dr  Roy Jankielsohn’s affidavit, it speaks specifically to all aspects surrounding the Vrede dairy project.” Watch related video below:
