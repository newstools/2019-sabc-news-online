The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the Free State says the voter registration for the August by-elections in the troubled Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in the eastern Free State is going well so far. The Commission says 91 voting stations have opened on time and that no challenges have been reported. The vacancies at the 15 wards in the QwaQwa-based municipality were created after the African National Congress (ANC) expelled its 16 Councillors, including a proportional representative. They were found guilty of voting with the opposition in the removal of former Executive Mayor Vusi Tshabalala. “We started at 8am today (Saturday) until 5pm where we have opened all voting stations for registration purposes. So we requested all the people around the Maluti-a-Phofung area in those affected wards to come and register and check their details on the voters’ roll and also those without addresses to provide us with addresses. So that is a process that we are embarking upon currently,” says Free State provincial electoral officer Jabulani Tshabalala. Click below for more on Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality:
