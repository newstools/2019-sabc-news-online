The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) says its members will continue with their protest until Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, gives workers a pay increase. Workers affiliated to the union have illegally blockaded various streets in the city using municipal buses. This caused chaos and major traffic disruptions.  The workers claim senior managers received salary increases, while general workers allegedly did not. Hundreds of workers gathered outside Tshwane House under heavy police guard. Several roads in the area have been been closed. Samwu Regional secretary, Mpho Tladinyane, says workers are demanding an 18% increase. “Workers are demanding that the 18% that was paid to senior managers must also be paid to all of us as junior employees of the City. We know that there is money; HR has already costed the process and finance has confirmed that there is money. Now what we only want to hear from the employer is when are they paying and then we’ll then be able to take it from there.” The MMC for Roads and Transport in Tshwane, Sheila Senkubuge, has warned that the City will take disciplinary action against protesters using municipal property to disrupt the lives of ordinary citizens.
