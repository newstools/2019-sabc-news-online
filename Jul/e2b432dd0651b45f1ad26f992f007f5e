Former Deputy South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner Ivan Pillay says he will challenge the Pubic Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s rogue unit report in court. The Public Protector on Friday released a report on the so-called “rogue unit” at SARS which implicated Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Pillay.  In an earlier report, Mkhwebane found that Gordhan, who was SARS Commissioner at the time, was unethical when he gave his deputy Ivan Pillay early retirement from SARS in 2010. That report is currently pending judicial review. Pillay’s lawyer Bernard Hotz says Mkhwebane’s Rogue Unit report is lawfully and factually incorrect. “It is clear to us that the fact that we have provided the public protector with detailed affidavits dealing with all of these issues is simply being ignored. It’s just wrong both factually, it’s wrong lawfully. And it would appear that very little to no investigation has been done. Where is her evidence? She says something without providing any evidence. The right place to ventilate it is in a court of law and that’s where we intend to ventilate it.”
