Former President Jacob Zuma has accused former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela of trying to push a negative agenda against him when she found that Zuma unduly benefited from the security upgrades at his Nkandla residence. Zuma was addressing his supporters in Parktown, Johannesburg on Friday. He retracted an earlier decision to withdraw from the State Capture Inquiry following consultations between his legal team, Justice Raymond Zondo and the Commission’s lawyers. Zuma claims Madonsela ruled against him even though she found nothing wrong on his part. He says: “She found no wrongdoing at all, nothing at all and decided to punish Zuma on the proposals made by our defence and the police. Zuma who did not ask for these things, the Public Protector said he must pay for it. The title of her report was interesting. She wanted to enhance the narrative about him. The title of the report was secured in comfort.”
