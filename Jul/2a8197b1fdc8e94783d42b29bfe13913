Taxi and bus commuters have been left stranded in Bloemfontein, Free State, on Tuesday night. This as drivers have embarked on a strike apparently due to unfair treatment by traffic officials and the issue of permits. Metered taxi operators that are not on strike have also been stopped from transporting people. Commuters are frustrated as they do not know how the’re going to get home. Some even doubt if they will make it to work tomorrow. Those who tried to use metered taxis as an alternative were forcefully taken out of the cars. It’s unclear when the strike will end.  Some people live as far as Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo and are frustrated as they do not have transport. School pupils who are also standing in the queues are worried about going to school on Wednesday. “I feel sad because I won’t be able to go to school and be able to fulfill my dreams. What the people of the taxis are doing is not fair to us South Africans,” says one student. Another commuter expresses concern over the situation, “I think this strike is affecting us. Why should we get involved? It’s our education. You want to go to school now, we are struggling how about tomorrow. This thing is affecting us, especially our education. It’s unfair. They must fix their problems.”
