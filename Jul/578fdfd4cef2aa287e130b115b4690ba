Embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will not return to work on Thursday after her leave of absence was extended by another month. The African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Working Committee says it has not concluded its report over corruption charges against Gumede related to a R208 million waste removal tender. The ANC’s provincial leadership then asked her to take 30 days leave of absence. The ANC said it needed more time before a final decision on her future could be made. “We are almost done. I think we are 95% done with the work we have been doing and the PWC will receive a report sometime next week, which will be considered by the PWC and be submitted to the PEC for a final decision to be made. The decision to give them a leave of absent for a period of 30 days was a political decision rather than a technical exercise. It was not merely about the fact that when 30 days lapses you wake up the following day and go to work. It was a question of allowing the organisation at least a minimum of 30 days to understand the issues,” explains party’s Provincial Secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli.
