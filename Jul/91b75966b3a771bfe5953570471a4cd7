The AmaBhele clan at Mqokolweni Great Place in Tsolo in the Eastern Cape has asked for privacy as it mourns the death of a chief and his wife. Nkosi Mathandeni Mabandla allegedly shot and killed his wife, Nobandla, a family friend Thembani Dubo, before turning the gun on himself. The royal family has announced that their funeral will be held on Friday, 9th August, at the Great Place. Family spokesperson Reverend Bukhosi Mabandla says: “We are all shocked. We had to gather there and express together with the in laws who had also come in to find out what had actually happened. After we had notified them that their daughter had passed on exactly what had happened we don’t know what led to the shooting nobody knows because the people who knew are the people who are dead.”
