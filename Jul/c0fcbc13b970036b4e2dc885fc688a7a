The pre-trial conference of #FeesMustFall leader, Mcebo Dlamani, is expected to commence in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Dlamini is facing a string of charges including public violence, assault, theft and damage to property. He was arrested at his residence at the University of Witwatersrand in October 2016, during the protests for free higher education. The #FeesMustFall leader was initially denied bail, however, the court overturned the decision. Dlamini is due to make yet another appearance in court this morning, in which a trial date is expected to be finalised. During his previous appearance last month, the court heard that the National Director of Public Prosecutions declined Dlamini’s representations to have the charges against him dropped. However, Dlamini says he will make an application to the High Court for a permanent stay of prosecution. This is because he believes that the charges against him are politically motivated for the role he played during the #FeesMustFall protests.
