Cabinet has approved the National Health Insurance Bill (NHI) and will be presented for Parliamentary processes. Primary health care in rural areas is a primary goal for the NHI project and in provinces like the Eastern Cape the need is dire. The NHI aims to provide world class health care at hospitals and  clinics. One such clinic is based in Lusikisiki and it already complies with the prescription of the NHI. The clinic consisted of a prefabricated construction and people had to wait in long lines for care. It had no waiting areas and when it rained and patients had to look for cover under trees. Ventilation was also very poor inside the structure but that has all changed. The new NHI spec clinic is now world class. It encompasses emergency services, dental care, optometry, a section for chronic patients, a 24 hour maternity ward, a chemist and a rehabilitation centre. Basic compliance is adhered to with a waiting room and rest rooms for the staff. It will also be staffed with medical professionals. The people making use of the facility are very impressed by the changes. “We are getting a great service and we receive medicine on time, we have no complaints yet,” says one patient. “I love the fact that nurses are attentive and are fast when helping you,” adds another one. The Health Department has also put a committee together to ensure the new facilities are maintained to consistently provide the same level of care.
