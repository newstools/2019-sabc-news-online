Opposition parties in the Northern Cape have welcomed the speech delivered by Premier Zamani Saul in his maiden State of the Province Address in Kimberley. A modern and innovative province is at the heart of Premier Saul’s plans for the next five years. Opposition parties say although they are happy with the premiers speech, they are still concerned about his implementation plans. “What is of concern to me is the fact that it seems as if the premier’s office will be centralising literally every little thing. Well whether it’s going to work I can only say good luck,” says the Democratic Alliance’s Andrew Louw. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says they will keep a close eye on the premier. “We are happy generally with the State of the Province Address, we are going to support the man but if he fumbles, we are attending to him immediately without any excuse,” says Provincial Secretary Shadrack Tlhaole.
