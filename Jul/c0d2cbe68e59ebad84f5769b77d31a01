The Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture has resumed in Parktown, Johannesburg, with testimony related to alleged fraud and corruption in the Estina dairy farm project in Vrede in the Free State. The Deputy Director General of Corporate administration in the Free State Premier’s office, Albertus Venter, has resumed his testimony after which the commission will hear from two of the farm’s beneficiaries. Provincial officials and the Gupta family allegedly looted more than R200 million meant for the project to help emerging black farmers. The Democratic Alliance member of the provincial legislature, Roy Jankielsohn told the commission on Monday that the farm was meant to benefit about 80 farmers but ended up only benefiting the Gupta family. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/721682">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
