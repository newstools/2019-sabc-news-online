The Ford Motor Company in South Africa has announced the creations of 1200 new jobs from its latest R3 billion investment into the country. Ford announced at a media briefing in Pretoria that the expansion of its production facilities at its Silverton Assembly Plant has been beefed up to produce over 720 vehicles a day. Ford revealed that the expansion project will offer fulltime employment to 104 skilled artisans and technicians. The vehicle manufacture explained that the demand for its Ford Ranger fleet in the international market has seen the steady rise of its exports which now reach just over 104 markets. Orkert Berry, Vise-President of Operations at Ford Motors Company South Africa, says the growing demand for the Ford Ranger is good for the growth of job opportunities. “We actually launched it this Monday evening. It now pushes up to 720 vehicles capability per day that we can build, the majority of that that will be exported to our European customers. So, we continue to see the global demand for the Ranger increasing, which is fantastic for us because that gives us the ability to grow more job opportunities.”
