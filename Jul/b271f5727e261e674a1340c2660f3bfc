Zimbabwean Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga has been flown to China to receive medical treatment. He had receiving treatment in a South African hospital earlier this month. The Zimbabwean government has not disclosed Chiwenga’s illness or his current state of being. In a statement, the government says that medical experts from South Africa, India and now China will be attending to the Vice President Chiwenga. They say he will undergo further medical tests as part of his treatment. Chiwenga, a former military general, led the 2017 military operation which led to the resignation of former President Robert Mugabe. “Operation Restore Legacy” as it was called saw the army take over the capital city Harare and the state broadcaster. Chiwenga led talks with Mugabe that convinced him to step down after 37 years. The operation helped Emmerson Mnangagwa become President after he had been fired by Mugabe in 2017. Mnangagwa then appointed Chiwenga as his Deputy President. Watch video below:
