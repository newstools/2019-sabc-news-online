The Free State province’s leadership is concerned about the poor performance of municipalities. Three of the municipalities in the province have been placed under administration. Premier Sisi Ntombela says they are not pleased with the progress regarding the assistance provided to the municipalities to recover. A task team has been formed. Last week, the Auditor-General’s report painted a bleak picture of the province’s municipalities as none of them received a clean audit.   Ntombela says a turnaround strategy should be implemented with immediate effect. “I formed a task team that is going to be led by the Director-General, Treasury and Cogta to go deep into municipalities and check what is really happening in the municipalities. I have instructed the MEC to come and report, to have a plan and report, tell us his plan.”
