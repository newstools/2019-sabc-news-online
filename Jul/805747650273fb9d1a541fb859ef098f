The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng says Premier David Makhura in his State of the Province address failed to clarify the five worst hospitals in the province that will receive special intervention over the next 12 months. The party says there are many hospitals that need to be improved. In the past few weeks, there have been several incidents that have been reported from Gauteng hospitals where patients were not well treated. The DA’s Jack Bloom says, “Last week in the State of the Province debate, I specifically asked the Premier to clarify which are the five worst hospitals that needed intervention because there is some confusion, and he didn’t reply to it. Which is why I am raising it again publicly – I will certainly add Thelle Mogoerane, I would add George Mukhari in addition to other hospitals already being mentioned which include, Sebokeng, Mamelodi, Bheki Mlangeni, Jubilee hospital and Tembisa.” Meanwhile, KwaZulu Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu has urgently requested Acting Head of Department, Dr Musa Gumede, to investigate the alleged carelessness of nursing staff at R.K. Khan Hospital at Chatsworth south of Durban. This comes after a shocking video went viral on social media showing a patient’s mouth teeming with maggots. In the footage, 52-year-old Azaad Ebrahim’s son can also be heard screaming, asking nurses for help. Unfortunately Saadick Ebrahim succumbed to death in hospital, later on Tuesday. Simelane-Zulu says she’s expecting feedback on Tuesday. She says those found guilty of alleged neglect of patients will be taken to task.  Watch related video below:
