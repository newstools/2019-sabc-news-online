The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng says it is not surprised by the latest developments in the province about the controversial e-tolling system. Recently, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Premier David Makhura were at loggerheads on Twitter over the issue of scrapping e-tolls in Gauteng.   Leader of the party in the Provincial Legislature, Solly Msimanga says it’s unfortunate that motorists fell for the African National Congress’s electioneering slogans on the e-tolls ahead of the May 8th general elections. Msimanga says it’s a fallacy that the ANC led provincial government would pay for debt incurred during the implementation process of e-tolls. “David Makhura is also saying now they’ll look into paying from Gauteng coffers. Now the question we’ve asked is where the money is coming from. I was looking at the budget on Friday.” “Not even a cent is allocated for this, this is more talk but little that we are going to experience, yet the people of Gauteng are not going to be wiser until they come up and speak in one voice.”  Related video click below:
