The Eastern Cape Cooperative Governance Department says it is gravely concerned about the state of affairs in some municipalities in the province. Only 2 municipalities out of 37 received clean audits. Two other municipalities received disclaimers. Cooperative Governance MEC Xolile Nqatha says most municipalities have returned funds not spent to the national treasury. He has vowed to tighten accountability measures. “Gone are the days where we will behave like things are normal and people will do as they wish and get their transfers working together provincial and national treasury  , we won’t transfer money and expose the funds to risk where there is dysfunctionality and people not co-operating with measures in terms of the constitution and Municipal Systems Act.” The troubled Amahlathi Local Municipality attained an unqualified report but the locals are not impressed as they believe that the municipality is badly run. “We have got the biggest challenge here of politicians who are clueless of what is expected of them as residents of the area, the other thing is the maladministration , because it’s so chaotic that we got unqualified managers and officials that run these municipalities,” says Black Business Forum’s Zola Kutsu. Local resident Annecke Pretorious says, “We were devastated last year when we saw our town burning down and we have not seen leadership step in and try and recover what we need to save.”
