The case against former Bosasa executives and former Correctional Services officials has been postponed to October 24 in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. The group have been charged with fraud and corruption amounting to R1.6 billion following a 2009 report by the Special Investigating Unit into tender irregularities in the Department of Correctional Services involving Bosasa. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi, former Correctional Services CFO Patrick Gillingham and former Commissioner Linda Mti, and former Bosasa executives Andries van Tonder, Frans Voster and Carlos Bonifacio made a brief court appearance. The matter was postponed for disclosure and to determine whether the three companies said to be implicated – Bosasa, Sondolo IT and Phezulu fencing – should be added to the charge sheet.
