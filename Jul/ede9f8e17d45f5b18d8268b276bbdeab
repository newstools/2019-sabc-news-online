Former President Jacob Zuma’s son Edward Zuma says the family is not afraid of threats allegedly made against them. Edward was speaking following former president Zuma having told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that his personal assistant was phoned by an unknown person, who threatened to kill him, his children and legal counsel. Zuma was expected to resume his testimony at the State Capture Commission on Friday – after it adjourned on Wednesday to allow more time for deliberations over the concerns the former president had raised relating to his questioning. Zuma complained that he is being cross-examined and expected to remember details of events that had nothing to do with his position as head of state. His son, Edward, says the family will not tolerate threats made against them. WATCH
