The African National Congress (ANC) NEC member and former Tourism Minister, Derek Hanekom has confirmed that there were several meetings between him and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Secretary General and MP Goldrich Gardee to discuss ways to oust former President Jacob Zuma. In a startling revelation on Tuesday, EFF leader Julius Malema launched a scathing attack on Hanekom and the SACP’s Solly Mapaila, saying “it’s strange that they are called fascists after they plotted with them to remove Zuma from power.” In a text message sent to SABC News, Hanekom wrote, “It’s no secret that there were a number of discussions between various organisations in the midst of a mounting campaign to get the former president removed from office.”   This new revelation from Hanekom comes at a time the ANC has announced a special committee that will investigate allegations – that some of its senior members have been working with the opposition during the May elections. This and other issues, including Zuma’s evidence at the State Capture, are expected to dominate discussions at the ANC NEC meeting this weekend. The ANC reiterates that every member has a duty to defend the party and its constitution. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe says, “The expectation is that each and everyone who is a member of the ANC in good standing shall act to defend the ANC in public, display the unity of the ANC in public, in the things that they do. Do everything they can to ensure that the ANC is a true and trusted representative of the public.”  -Additional reporting by Natasha Phiri
