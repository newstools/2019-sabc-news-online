The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has instructed its legal team to join in the defence of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane against an urgent court interdict launched by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Mkhwebane says she will defend her findings and recommendations against Gordhan in court. She found that Gordhan contravened the Constitution by establishing the “so-called” South African Revenue Service (SARS)  rogue unit when he was SARS Commissioner.  The report also found that Gordhan had lied to the National Assembly when he said that he had never met members of the Gupta family. In a statement the EFF says it is surprised that Gordhan is trying to halt the implementation of the remedial actions of Mkhwebane and sees it as an attempt to put himself above the law.
