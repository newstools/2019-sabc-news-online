Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she will defend the findings and recommendations against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan in court. Gordhan has indicated that he will take the findings of her report on review. Mkhwebane found that Gordhan contravened the Constitution by establishing the so-called South African Revenue Service (SARS) rogue unit when he was SARS Commissioner. The report also found that Gordhan had lied to the National Assembly when he said that he had never met members of the Gupta family. In a statement, Mkhwebane says she is confident about her findings and that she is disappointed about the insulting tone of Gordhan’s affidavit to the courts. The affidavit describes Mkhwebane as being “incompetent, irrational and negligent in the performance of her duties as evidenced by the overturning or the challenging of a number of her reports in the courts.” Click below for more on the story:
