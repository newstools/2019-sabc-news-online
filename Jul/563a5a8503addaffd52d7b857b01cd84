Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has rejected with contempt reports by Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), that she was “flagged” by global bank HSBC, as having financial links to the Guptas. Mkhwebane says in a statement that she heard for the first time from the OCCRP last Thursday that she had been “flagged”. She says she has no links with the Guptas. Mkhwebane says in her statement that the OCCRP’s admitted that there was no indication that the source of the 5 000 US dollars she allegedly received was from the Guptas. She says it is strange that the OCCRP is now reporting that she was “flagged” as having financial ties to the Guptas. Earlier, the OCCRP reported that leaks it has received show that HSBC flagged a payment of over  5 000 US dollars allegedly made to Mkhwebane’s First National Bank account in June 2014. That’s around R70 000 at Thursday’s  exchange rate. The OCCRP says the flagging of the transfer emanated from an internal HSBC probe into Gupta linked accounts around the world. The Project says there is no indication of wrongdoing on Mkhwebane’s part. However it reports that the HSBC included the payment among those allegedly linked to Gupta kickbacks.
