The chief prosecutor of a UN tribunal has accused South Africa of failing to co-operate in the arrest of a fugitive being sought over his role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Serge Brammertz, chief prosecutor of the UN’s International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals says since August of last year, his office has been seeking urgent co-operation from South Africa in relation to the arrest of a fugitive. It is the first time that South Africa has been accused of failing to assist in the arrest of a fugitive being sought by the court. In the past Kenya has been accused of protecting Felicien Kabuga, once one of Rwanda’s richest men accused of financing the genocide. Kabuga is one of eight fugitives that remain at large. Legal sources say the former presidential guard head Protais Mpiranya is believed to be hiding in South Africa.
