Ahead of Mandela Day on Thursday, 17 climbers are preparing to conquer Kilimanjaro. The group began their mission by visiting a school in Hammanskraal in Tshwane. They spent the day revamping Lehwelereng Secondary School. Trek4Mandela is aimed at raising funds for various causes in celebration of Madiba’s legacy. The project adopts local activists to ensure continuity. Fundraiser, Kefentse Mkhari, says that there will be 25 000 packs given across 25 schools in celebration of 25 years of democracy. The beneficiaries are inspired. Learner Prudence Nkambule says girls need to stay in school despite challenges and should not fall into the trap of sugar daddies. The Education Department wants to see more done towards technology and the skilling of young women. The Trek4Mandela team will leave on Saturday for Tanzania and is expected to summit Mount Kilimanjaro on Mandela’s birthday, 18 July. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
