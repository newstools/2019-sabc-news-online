The South African Communist Party (SACP)’s Solly Mapaila has described former President Jacob Zuma’s testimony at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture as a clear diversion of what is at stake in the country. Mapaila says Zuma’s allegations about individuals who were apartheid spies were irresponsible. “Even this question about allegations of spy, we felt they were irresponsible utterances, reckless and not even belonging there.” “We were quite shocked at a former President – who has presided over the ANC, who was Deputy President of the country before – would have allowed these comrades to hold senior public office where they worked against the values of this democracy,” Mapaila explains.  With three commissions of inquiry into corruption at state and state owned entities underway, the SACP and the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation believe the rot is being exposed. Ahmad Kathrada Foundation Executive Director, Neeshan Balton says he would like to see the Gupta brothers rot in jail for perpetuating state capture in the country. “It is my personal view and I’m sure many other people in South Africa, that while we know the Guptas don’t represent the totality of State Capture, they do epitomize it in its worst form. And for me personally, I think and for many South Africans would be to see one of them prosecuted and being put behind bars and wearing orange overalls.”
