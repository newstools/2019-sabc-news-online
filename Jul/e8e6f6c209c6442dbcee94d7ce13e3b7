The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has urged motorists to remain vigilant on the roads as temperatures are expected to remain low – with some areas dipping to single digit levels. Snow has fallen in the Drakensberg – and in parts of the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Free State. Another cold front is expected to hit the Western Cape on Tuesday, bringing with it rain and low temperatures.

We are just seeing a few showers over Western Cape for today and then again they will dissipate.” “Maybe there will be another chance for some light rain on Tuesday, but we are not seeing lots of rain entering the interior, it will just remain low with a light breeze which will make it feel worse. Dress up warm and keep yourself warm. That cup of coffee will help in the office and if you are driving just make sure your heater is on because you need to be comfortable so you can be extremely vigilant as you drive,” explains Tuwani.
