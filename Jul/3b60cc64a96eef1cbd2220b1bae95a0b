Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has filed an urgent application to suspend and interdict the remedial actions of a report released by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Mkhwebane’s report found Gordhan guilty of maladministration and violating the prescripts of the National Strategic Intelligence Act, as well as the Constitution, for the establishment of an intelligence unit at the South African Revenue Service in 2007. Gordhan’s lawyer, Tebogo Malatji, says his client wants to review and set aside the report and have it declared unlawful, unconstitutional, irrational and invalid. “She can only entertain such as complaint if it has special circumstance, none have been demonstrated. She has absolutely and blatantly ignored the fact that this is not a new topic; it is almost like a broken record.” “She hasn’t even given herself time to process what was presented to her by us and our affected parties like Mr [Ivan] Pillay. When you read her report there is little or no integration with the submissions that have been made to her.” “It is almost like it was a foregone conclusion and she paid lip service to the requirements that before she issues the report she must be given an opportunity to address it.” Related video click below:
