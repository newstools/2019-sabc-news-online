A businessman based in Vrede in the Free State has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg that he met three men that he believes were the Gupta brothers. Willie Basson says the men arrived at the Vrede dairy farm with a plan on how they were to establish a new milk processing plant. He says the men told him that they were from India and needed to do business in Vrede, but did not have the necessary tools. Speaking through an interpreter, Basson said from then, the men got assistance from his employees. Earlier, the Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo appealed to the evidence leader, Advocate Leah Gcabashe to make fresh attempts to get Bassonâ€™s evidence. On Thursday, the interpreter at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg had to be excused due to being inaccurate. The commission is currently focusing on the controversial Estina dairy farm project in Vrede. The project has been one of the most controversial transactions between the Guptas and the provincial government. Click below to watch told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture:
