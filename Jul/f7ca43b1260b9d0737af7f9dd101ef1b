The High Court in Cape Town has ruled that last month’s removal of the Democratic Alliance (DA) mayor of the Cederberg municipality, William Farmer and Deputy Mayor, Francina Sokuyeka of the ADC party, was unlawful. The DA in the Western Cape has welcomed a High Court ruling. On the 26th of last month, the ANC convinced DA speaker Bertie Zass to join the ANC and vote with the party in an urgent motion of no confidence in the mayor and deputy mayor. Acting judge Fred Sievers also ruled that the election of Paulus Strauss as the speaker and any decisions made by African National Congress (ANC’s) Sylvia Qunta and Marianne Nel during their illegal occupation of office is considered unlawful. DA provincial leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, called the ruling a victory for the people of Cederberg who elected the DA to govern the municipality. The party says it is further encouraged that the respondents, including Qunta and Nel were ordered to pay the legal costs.
