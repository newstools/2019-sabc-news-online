The leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema is expected back in the Newcastle Magistrates’ Court in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. Last week, the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Malema’s application to have the Riotous Assemblies Act declared unconstitutional. Malema challenged the constitutionality of the Act, saying it was apartheid legislation which did not belong in the law books. The court ruled that it does not have the jurisdiction to rule on the matter. Malema has been charged with violating the Act in Newcastle and in Bloemfontein in the Free State after he urged supporters to invade vacant land. Watch related video below:
