Disturbing footage has emerged showing a woman being forcibly held down by a male Johannesburg Metro Police officer, and then screaming while a nurse draws blood from the woman against her will. The video was taken at the weekend at the Douglasdale Police Station and has since gone viral on social media. JMPD Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says although the police officers acted well within their rights, an investigation will be conducted to determine the level of force used as well as the circumstances surrounding the incident. “Section 37 of the CPA is clear to be able to restrain an individual for the drawing of a blood sample or a breath sample in the case of drunken driving. There will be an investigation to determine the level of force used. We don’t know what was the circumstances. The resistance of the drawing of blood is not something new. It just so happens that this particular incident was captured on video,” explains Minnaar. Watch interview below for more on the story:
