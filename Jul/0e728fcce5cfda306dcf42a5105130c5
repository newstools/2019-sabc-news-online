The South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) in the North West has threatened to embark on a strike in several municipalities in the province. This comes as some municipalities report that they will not be able to pay salaries to their employees this month due to financial crises. Workers at the Bojanala District Municipality in Rustenburg and Tswaing in Delareyville have not received their salaries since May. SAMWU provincial secretary, Vincent Diphoko, says they are consulting with their members in all the affected municipalities in the province. “We don’t want stories that equitable shares have never been paid. We do not have money to pay salaries. Starting from today (Friday) workers must stop from going to work until their salaries are paid. We know the principle of no work no pay. Workers are not getting salaries and we must apply the principle of saying No pay No work, and workers must not be tainted or tarnished based on issues that workers have not gotten their salaries.”
