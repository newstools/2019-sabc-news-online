Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says corrupt leaders are compromising the safety of mineworkers. He says that is why the remains of three mineworkers who died in 2016 at the Lily Mine in Baberton in Mpumalanga have never been retrieved. Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyeranda were trapped underground after the lamp room in which they were working, collapsed. Speaking at the EFF’s sixth-anniversary celebrations at the KaNyamazane stadium near Mbombela on Saturday, Malema said politicians have prioritised their own interests. “Three mine workers are still trapped at Lily Mine, the families are still here (at the mine). The security and safety in mining in South Africa is not a priority especially in Mpumalanga, politicians are line upping and mines, safety is not a priority  as long as they get their money,” says Malema. The families of the three victims and former mineworkers have been camping outside the mine premises since early May.  The families have called on government to force the current owners to give it up so that it can be reopened. They want their loved ones retrieved from underground.
