Police Minister General Bheki Cele will on Sunday return to  Philipi East and surrounding areas on the Cape Flats. The visit will be to engage with the community during a walkabout to get feedback on the recent deployments to volatile and gang-infested areas. Cele announced on Thursday evening that soldiers from the  South African National Defence Force would be deployed to hot spots in the area following a spike in serious crime and murders. The SANDF says soldiers will be deployed once all the legal paperwork is in order. On Saturday issues such as the collaboration between law enforcement, non-profit organisations, civil society and various communities were hot on the table during a crime summit held in Paarl in the Western Cape. Cele met with various stakeholders to discuss a last solution to crime in the Western Cape. The two-day summit ends Sunday with the minister expected to meet with the community. Cele hosted the 500 delegates at the event.  The summit comes as communities on the Cape Flats await the deployment of the army to curb gang violence. The summit will see delegates adopting a declaration outlining their commitment to ensuring the safety of all citizens of the province.  Early on Saturday morning,  there was another fatal shooting in Blikkiesdorp in Delft in Cape Town. Police said the body of a 27-year-old man was found with gunshot wounds to the head and other parts. A 22-year-old woman was also shot and wounded in the area. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said six dwellings were torched on Friday night. Cases of murder, attempted murder and arson are being investigated. The incidents come as the army is deployed to the Cape Flats to support the police in the fight against rising crime.
