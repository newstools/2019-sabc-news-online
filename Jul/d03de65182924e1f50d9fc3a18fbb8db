The Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape says the only way to achieve economic recovery in South Africa is by cutting down the bloated national government. The DA’s comment follows the release of the unemployment figures by Statistics SA which show that the unemployment rate rose to an 11-year high from 27.6% to 29% in the second quarter of 2019. However, the Western Cape is the only province whose official unemployment rate has decreased year-on-year. It dropped from 20.7% in the second quarter of 2018 to 20.4% in the second quarter of this year. DA Western Cape Finance spokesperson is Deidré Baartman. “While the Western Cape remains the province with the lowest official and expanded unemployment rates, at 20,4% and 23,8% respectively, it is concerning to note a slight increase in these figures from the previous quarter. I will be meeting with Western Cape Minister of Finance, Economic Opportunities, and Tourism David Maynier, to determine how the DA-led Western Cape Government is helping to improve job creation and enable economic growth in our province.”
