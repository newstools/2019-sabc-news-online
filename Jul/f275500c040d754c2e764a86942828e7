The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) says over 2000 accounts have been frozen nationally due to suspected fraudulent activities. The agency has asked banks and the Post Office to stop making payments to those frozen accounts. KwaZulu-Natal SASSA spokesperson, Mbizeni Mdlalose, says beneficiaries who might be affected can get affidavits from the police to confirm they are rightful beneficiaries and their funds will be released. “There are about 2800 accounts that were frozen due to suspected fraud. We also want to confirm that our beneficiaries they will be able to get their money as long as they will be able to present themselves at SASSA offices where they will be expected to fill in an SAPS affidavit to confirm that the account indeed belongs to them. They will also have to confirm their banking details then the monies will be released to them,” says Mdlalose.
