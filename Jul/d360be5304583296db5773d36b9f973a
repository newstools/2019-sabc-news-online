Police in Bloemfontein are investigating a case of malicious damage to property,  after disgruntled Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members attempted to force their way into a conference venue at the University of the Free State on Saturday. The EFF held the third Students Command Assembly at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein. They went on the rampage, pelting vehicles with stones at the nearby Brandwag shopping complex. They also clashed with security police and allegedly vandalised the security house on the campus. Free State EFF Chairperson Mandisa Makeseni says the party cannot be drawn into the matter as it happened outside the conference venue. “We as Parkweg police have opened a case of malicious damage to property and illegal national strike, section 38. It is unknown what started the strike and no one has been arrested,” says Police spokesperson Wendy Nkabi.
