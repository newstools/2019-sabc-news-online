The State Capture Commission has been adjourned for the day in Johannesburg following former President Jacob Zuma saying he is willing to continue to participate in the Commission. Earlier in the day Zuma’s lawyers indicated that he would be pulling out due to the way he was cross-examined, claiming that it was in breach of the Commission’s rules. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo made the announcement of Zuma’s willingness to continue following a meeting between the Commission’s lawyers and those of the former President. Justice Zondo explains the way in which Zuma’s concerns will be taken care of going forward. “The Commission’s legal team will indicate to his legal team what the Commission’s areas of interest are in each witnesses’ statement or affidavit,  on which the Commission or they would like the former President to testify and that thereafter the former President will then provide, through his legal team, statements that indicate what he has to say on the incidents or areas of interest.”
