Civic organisation, SANCO has handed a memorandum of grievances to the City of Johannesburg in Braamfontein, on Thursday. They are displeased with the quality of services in Soweto. SANCO has also called for Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba to resign, accusing him of promoting land invasions by providing services to those who occupy land illegally. Among their demands, they are calling for a reduction in payment for services and a demand for a flat electricity rate. Soweto resident, Martha Kekana, says they demand a flat rate for electricity bills. “I think four to five blocks don’t have electricity…. We want one flat rate to pay Eskom… We have had enough.” Soweto residents owe Eskom a staggering R18-billion. The power utility has begun cutting electricity to defaulting customers as rising municipal debt are posing a threat to Eskom’s sustainability.  SANCO opens case against the Mayor SANCO opened a case against the Mayor at the Johannesburg Police Station earlier this month. They have also handed a memorandum at Eskom in Braamfontein, in protest against recent power cuts in Soweto. SANCO Spokesperson Simphiwe Hlafa claims Mashaba only prioritises affluent suburbs. “The reality is there for everyone to see. The evidence is there, that’s why you see us in fact here at Eskom, because we want the electrification for the people of Soweto who have been without electricity for quite sometime. But we guarantee you, it will never happen in Sandton; it will never happen in Morningside. If in Morningside they don’t have electricity by 8 o’clock, definitely by 8h30 electricity is restored unlike in Soweto informal settlements.
