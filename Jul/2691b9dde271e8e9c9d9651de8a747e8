Deputy Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Obed Bapela says almost R20 billion will be needed to properly develop Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. Bapela says the estimated budget is also allocated for the surrounding areas of Alexandra. This was heard during his submission at the South African Human Rights Commissions Inquiry into  Alexandra in Braamfontein, on Wednesday. “When in 2014 work was then done and we realised that old Alexandra will need R12.6 billion, that was 2014. And then deal with the surrounding Alexandra, the factories in Malboro, Wynberg, another additional R3.9 billion is needed. So in all we needed R16.5 billion. The figures might have gone up because price escalation continues,” says Bapela. During his submission to the inquiry, Bapela requested that residents of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, stop building illegal houses – as the department is to remodel the area. The Deputy Minister warned that they will not compensate those who have built in the area illegally. “To the people in Alex, stop building because we are going to be remodelling Alexandra. To those who have built illegally, you may not be compensated. You have done an illegal act and on that, we can’t compensate someone who is illegally on the land when it does not belong to them.  They come into an area and build accommodations. So you are wasting your own money. We will deal with this issue to clear spaces for the new Alexandra to emerge.” Click below for more on the story:
