President Cyril Ramaphosa has encouraged people to become visionaries and dreamers to help the country develop technologies in the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IRSA). The 4IRSA is currently introducing technologies and trends such as robotics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Ramaphosa was speaking at the Digital Economy Summit at Gallagher Estate in Midrand, Johannesburg. “You are all dreamers, I can see it in your faces and eyes, I can see a lot of dreamers. You are visionaries and people who want to be creators, people who are deeply immersed in the future and understand the power of dreaming as well. You are seeking to act to turn those dreams into reality.” Ramaphosa adds: “The nation expects that in this summit you will be able to come up with ideas that are going to form the foundation that will help the nation to be catapulted to a higher level of intellectual knowledge to get the country to embrace the 4th Industrial Revolution.” Ramaphosa made history on Friday when he became the first president to give a keynote speech via a hologram.
