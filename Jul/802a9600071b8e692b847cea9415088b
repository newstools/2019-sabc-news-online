The Commission of Inquiry hearing into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) resumes on Monday in Pretoria. Former PIC CEO Dan Matjila is expected to take the stand. Matjilaâ€™s testimony is scheduled to go on until Thursday. Matjila has been accused of misuse of funds and careless investment decisions at the PIC. He has denied the allegations. Matjila resigned in November 2018 amid allegations of corruption and nepotism. He has also been implicated in the testimony of numerous witnesses, including that of former CFO Matshepo More. The PIC manages pension funds on behalf of public sector employees.
