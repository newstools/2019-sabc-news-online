The former Chief of State Protocol Bruce Koloane is due to take the stand again at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday. Koloane, who testified on Monday, sought to clarify his role in the controversial landing of the Gupta plane at the Waterkloof Air Force base in April 2013. The Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster’s investigation had found that Koloane was central to the landing of the plane – without the correct permission. Koloane’s legal counsel Don Mahon requested the Commission to allow them to have access to the recordings which implicate him in order to determine a way forward. Mahon says, “In order for us to form a view on whether the Ambassador will be prejudiced in continuing or not this question of the recordings is a spanner in the works because obviously we want to listen to them first before we make that election…So if we could have them immediately we could consider them overnight and then tomorrow (Tuesday) we could come back and inform you Chair what our position is…” WATCH
