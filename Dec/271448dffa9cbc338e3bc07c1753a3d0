The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has called on Eskom’s leaders to work on a maintenance plan, rather than blame the former leaders for the energy crisis facing the power utility. The union made these comments after it rejected President Cyril Ramaphosa’s contention that sabotage was partly to blame for the load shedding. The alleged sabotage apparently occurred at the Tutuka power station in Mpumalanga. Ramaphosa assured South Africans that there’s unlikely to be another bout of load shedding between December 17, 2019 and January 2020, once the current power cuts end. NUM’s Energy Sector Coordinator Paris Mashego says the leadership of Eskom needs to develop a proper maintenance plan to avoid more load shedding. “It’s a poor maintenance plan. Management and the board have not developed a proper plan. They are blaming the former leadership of Eskom to say that they didn’t do maintenance. They have to develop a proper management plan. It worries us because one of the board members in September announced that there could be load shedding for 6 months to maintain the plants – so there is a backlog of maintenance. This is the biggest challenge.”   WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
