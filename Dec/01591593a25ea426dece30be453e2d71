The City of Cape Town has appealed for people wanting to dispose of waste legally, to do so at an allocated site. This follows the discovery of a large number of shark trunks on the Strandfontein beach on the West Coast on Sunday morning. Shark fins are targets for poachers as they fetch a high price on the market and are used in delicacies overseas. The City’s Safety and Security spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, says they are investigating the circumstances behind the dumping of waste on the beach… “Our plea as the city is, we have made a number of sites available where people can dispose of waste legally. In many cases it doesn’t cost you a cent, all you need to do is get there. It really is unnecessary for people to do this type of thing as it exposes general members of the public to health risks. So if you have any waste and you want to dispose of it legally, consult the city’s website then we won’t have this type of problem, assuming that is what happened.”  Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/792480">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
