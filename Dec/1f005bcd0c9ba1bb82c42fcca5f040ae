The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will hold its last sitting for the year on Friday morning before NCOP delegates go into the December recess. The second House of Parliament adjourns just two days after the National Assembly bade farewell to the year 2019 on Wednesday. Just before adjourning, the NCOP will consider various bills, some of which have been referred to it by the National Assembly for concurrence. Parliament’s Spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo says the NCOP will on Friday consider the Hydrographic Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, the Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill, the Rates and Monetary Amounts and  the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill. It is also expected to consider the proposed division of revenue and conditional grant allocations to provinces and local government as well as the Adjustments Appropriation Bill before concluding with farewell speeches from NCOP delegates.
