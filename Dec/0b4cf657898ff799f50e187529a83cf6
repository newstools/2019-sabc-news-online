A Northern Cape non-profit organisation, Caritas, has launched a 24-four helpline to provide emotional support to farmers affected by the drought. The organisation says the focus is always on dying animals and job losses in the sector and very little consideration is given to the emotional distress that farmers suffer. The persistent drought has caused a headache for both farmers and authorities. Unlike other provinces, the Northern Cape has not had much rain. The NGOs Manager, Estie Botha says, they’ve decided to set up the helpline to assist those who feel overwhelmed. “The farmers on the farm and all the farm workers, they are really struggling emotionally and the trauma that they experience with animals dying every day and the shortage of the money at this stage, they really stress about school fees, for their children and hostel fees.” Farming communities across the country are urged to call 083 415 1484 for emotional support. They can either call, or SMS or Whatsapp on the same number.
