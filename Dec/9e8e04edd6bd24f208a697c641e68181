A 26-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a woman whose body was found in her boyfriend’s yard at Senwamekgope outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo on Tuesday morning. Sibongile Nkanyani’s murder led to incidents of mob violence, in which four houses were set alight on Wednesday night. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says the suspect was apprehended at Thakgalane village on Thursday night. Nkanyane was found dead by her boyfriend’s father in his ploughing fields on Tuesday morning. She had multiple head injuries. Her family believes she had been killed by her boyfriend, as they had been fighting over their one-year old’s social grant payments. Mojapelo says the suspect will make his first court appearance next week Monday.
