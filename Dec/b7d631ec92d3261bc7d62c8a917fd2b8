The Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department has dispatched disaster management teams to Ndwendwe, north of Durban, where the Sanganwa Mountain has partially collapsed. The mountain began crumbling earlier this week, leaving the community in a panic. Community member Mfefi Gwala says they have not been sleeping because they don’t feel safe. “Yesterday it started collapsing since nine o clock in the morning until very late at night. It was impossible to sleep because we could hear the rumbling of stones we were too scared to sleep. When we went outside we saw so much dust that we couldn’t see beyond the red cloud of dust.” Speaker of the Ndwedwe Municipality Khonza Ngidi says they are working with the department to ensure the safety of the residents. “We are traumatised all of us because this is the first time to see this thing. But the way we see it this is urgent that’s why we’ve communicated with COGTA because we can see the urgency because we have a community around this mountain. I think today they are supposed to come.”
