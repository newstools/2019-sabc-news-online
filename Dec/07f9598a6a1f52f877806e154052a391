The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has urged residents to reduce water consumption as low storage levels are experienced in various reservoirs. Municipal Spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki says the low levels are caused by the reduction in production in the Nooitgedgat Water Treatment Works. Mniki says the Department of Water and Sanitation requested a supply to be reduced from 30% to 20% due to a canal failure higher up in the Orange River transfer scheme. This has caused low levels in the balancing dam that feeds Nooitgedagt Treatment Works.
