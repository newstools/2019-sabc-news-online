President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Ghana on a working visit. The President who began his trip in the Republic of Guinea is expected to meet with Ghanaian President Nana Akufoo-ado and then hold a Ghana-South Africa bilateral summit later in the day. The President’s visit comes ahead of South Africa assuming the chairmanship of the African Union in 2020. The AU theme for 2020 is ‘silencing the guns in 2020’. Ramaphosa’s office said the visit to Guinea, Ghana and Togo will provide an opportunity for South Africa to explore new areas of cooperation with the three countries, and to promote increased trade and investment flows between them. In Guinea, the President said he hopes to tap from the knowledge of the outgoing chairman Guinea’s President Alpha Conde.
