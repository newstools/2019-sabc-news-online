The High Court in Pretoria will on Tuesday hear arguments in the Democratic Alliance court bid to halt the removal of Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and Speaker Katlego Mathebe. The two were ousted when a controversial motion of no confidence against them was passed earlier this month. Mathebe had recused herself from the special sitting of Council in an attempt to avoid conflict of interest in the motion against herself. But Gauteng’s Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department presided over the meeting and allowed the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the African National Congress (ANC) to nominate EFF councillor Obakeng Ramabodu to act in the speaker’s role. The High Court interdicted this arrangement and will allow all parties to present their arguments. Watch the video below for related news:
