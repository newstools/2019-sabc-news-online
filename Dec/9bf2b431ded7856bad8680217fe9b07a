The African National Congress (ANC) has welcomed the life sentences imposed by the Knysna Circuit High Court on the three men convicted of the murder of a councillor in the Southern Cape town in 2018. The party says it hopes the sentence will act as a deterrent against political killings. Victor Molosi, the party’s chief whip in Knysna, was shot and killed outside his Concordia home. The hit was organised by former independent councillor, Velile Waxa and his two accomplices. “We feel that the judge has corrected something. To kill political leadership you are actually dealing with democracy because its the leadership that is elected by them. You are therefore frustrating people for choosing their own. Even if it was political differences we are saying it was supposed to fit in the ballot box and not use a rifle to solve your political frustrations,” says ANC regional secretary Major Sokopo.
