The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein will hand down judgment in the Jason Rohde case on Wednesday. Rohde appealed a High Court decision not to release him on bail while he waits to appeal his murder conviction and sentence. Rohde was found guilty in November last year of the murder of his wife Susan, and of staging her suicide at the Spier Hotel in Stellenbosch three years ago. During his trial Rohde maintained his innocence, claiming his extramarital affair had driven his wife to take her own life. In February, he was sentenced to 18 years for the murder and five years for staging the suicide, of which three years were ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for the murder. He applied for leave to appeal Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe who turned down his request in April, saying the defence had rehashed arguments made during Rohdeâ€™s trial and sentencing.
