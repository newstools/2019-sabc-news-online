A 19-year-old schoolboy has been arrested in connection with the murder of an 18-year old Mahikeng girl in the North West. The burnt body of the victim was found next to a local primary school at Ramosadi village outside Mahikeng on Sunday morning. She has been stabbed multiple times before being burned to death. Heinous crimes against women continue to send shock waves, across the country.  The latest victim is 18-year old Gomolemo Legae from Seweding village. Her burnt body was found in the early hours of Sunday.  She was stabbed several times, and doused with petrol before being burnt.  The alleged perpetrator is a 19 year old school pupil who has since been arrested. Police say allegations of rape are also being investigated. “Reports suggest that the woman was on her way home when the suspect approached her. Although she was subsequently found bleeding, she managed to inform the members of the community who the suspect was. We can confirm that what we found as the police is five stab wounds and two scratches and the woman suffered third degree burns. “We cannot, at this stage, confirm as to whether there was a relationship between the suspect and the victim. We also can’t rule out the possibility that the suspect may face further charges including rape,” says SAPS North West’s Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone. The family is pinning its hopes on swift justice. “We are deeply hurt by this ordeal. We got a confirmation this morning (Tuesday) that he had been arrested and we hope that he doesn’t get bail and gets a harsh sentence for this because honestly he doesn’t deserve to live in society. He must just rot in jail,” says the deceased’s aunt Masego Mashetla. The suspect is expected to appear at the Mmabatho Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The victim Gomolemo Legae will also be buried on Wednesday.
