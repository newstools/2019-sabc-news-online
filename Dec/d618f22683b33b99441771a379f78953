The National Assembly has again failed to pass a resolution to recommend that former uMsunduzi mayor Zanele Hlatshwayo be appointed to the Public Service Commission. A total of 201 MPs are required to vote in favour of her appointment as the Constitution requires the majority vote of the Assembly to pass the resolution. This is the second time that the resolution has not been passed. National Assembly House Chairperson Cedric Frolick says the matter has been postponed as it failed to meet the constitutional requirement. “The outcome of the division is as follows: there are no abstentions. 91 voted against, 176 voted in favour. The decision on the question is thus postponed because it does not meet the constitutional requirement.”
