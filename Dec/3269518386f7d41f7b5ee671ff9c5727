African Ministers attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, have called on parties not to abandon their ambitions in their search for compromise. Negotiations on climate action mechanism are still on-going despite the conference having being scheduled to end on Friday night. Delegates failed to resolve multiple disputes over the implementation of a climate accord forged in Paris in 2016. Some big countries are rejecting the call to increase carbon reduction targets while increasing their funding for mitigation efforts. The developing countries are also not budging from their position. Environmental Affairs Minister Barbara Creecy maintains they want predictable and adequate funding for climate change adaptation. Earlier today, the European Union urged the summit to send a strong message that countries are ready to do more to cut emissions. The call comes amid growing fears that international efforts to fight climate change are slipping into reverse. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
