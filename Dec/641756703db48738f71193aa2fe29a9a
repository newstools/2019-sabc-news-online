Two suspects have been shot and killed during an alleged housebreaking in Linbro Park north east of Johannesburg. Police say while information is still sketchy at this stage, preliminary reports suggest that three suspected would-be robbers were intercepted while inside a house on 1st Avenue in Linbro Park. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says the suspects were armed with a firearm and other weapons. “One of the suspects was armed with a firearm while the other two had on them items and instruments believed were to be utilised by them to commit a crime. These included a pick, cable ties, screw driver and hand gloves. A man in the house allegedly fired shots and one suspect was fatally wounded while a second suspect was found outside the house and was shortly declared dead. The third suspect managed to escape.”
