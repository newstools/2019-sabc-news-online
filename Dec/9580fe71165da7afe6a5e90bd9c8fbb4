Delegates at the Economic Freedom Fighters‘(EFF) second elective conference which is underway at Nasrec, south of Johannesburg, are expected to nominate and elect top party leaders on Saturday. The Institute of Election Management, which is chaired by former IEC top brass, Terry Tselane, will conduct the elections. Some political analysts say it will be a highly-contested race and word on the ground is that Julius Malema will retain his position as the CIC of the party followed by Floyd Shivambu, but of course people have been saying that Dali Mpofu has been wanting to contest that position. We might see Marshall Dlamini come in as the SG of the party.  Malema is expected to take the podium this morning to deliver the party’s political report. This will outline the challenges the country is facing and its proposals on how to mitigate these. Later in the day Secretary General Goodrich Gardi will give an assessment of the state of the party with nomination for a new leadership set to take place in the evening. Assembly divided Meanwhile, there’s speculation that the EFF assembly is divided and the party’s national chairperson Dali Mpofu and secretary general Godrich Gardee will be replaced. However, Mpofu says the delegates have the final say. “These are delegates, they’ve been delegated by their branches, the word delegate means that you are here to represent a hundred or more people of your branch, so that’s why these people have been selected by their branches because they are the most disciplined of that group to come here and represent their aspirations, so the future of the organisation is actually in the future of the delegates.”
