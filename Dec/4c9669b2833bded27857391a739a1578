The current heat wave sweeping most parts of the country is expected to subside with rain anticipated in some areas from this evening. The South African Weather Services says the heat wave will continue in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo until Tuesday. However, areas such as North West and the Free State can expect isolated showers and thundershowers starting from Monday. “Yes, there are showers that are expected from today more over the central parts of the country. Hence the heat wave will end over those areas today. Tomorrow we expecting this rain to spread over to the Eastern provinces – Gauteng and Limpopo – hence we expect the heat wave to cease over those areas” says forecaster Dipuo Tawana.
