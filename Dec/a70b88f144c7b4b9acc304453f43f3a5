The case of four suspects accused of kidnapping six-year-old Amy Leigh de Jager is expected to resume in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court Friday morning. They face charges of kidnapping and extortion after R2 million was initially demanded from the little girl’s family. The suspects allegedly kidnapped the child outside her school in the Vaal in September. Two of the accused Katherine Human, who has since resigned as a teacher at Amy Leigh’s school, and Pieter van Zyl were denied bail. Another suspect Laetitia Nel was granted bail of R25 000. The fourth accused Molemohi Bafokeng abandoned his bail application.
