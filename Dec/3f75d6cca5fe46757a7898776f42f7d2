A presidential pardon is what is standing between Abathembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo and resuming his duties as king. Acting Abathembu King, Azenathi Dalindyebo, is expected to continue in his role while the Abathembu Kingdom applies for a presidential pardon. King Dalindyebo was released on parole this week, after spending nearly four years in prison. He is among the offenders qualifying for remission of his sentence by twelve months. The Abathembu King’s release came as a surprise to some while it was a welcomed move to others, especially the AbaThembu kingdom. While many expected the release would be met with jubilation, the royal family says the king is yet to meet his people. They are applying for a presidential pardon with an expectation to wipe his slate clean, before resuming his duties. “It is not an indigenous law. As we have come to this juncture of our democracy, we adopted certain western laws. As Abathembu, we didn’t think our king should be incarcerated,” says Abathembu Royal House’s Chief Ntsika Joyi. The Abathembu nation has been against the imprisonment of their king. They have urged the president to fast track the process. “He should not be treated like a criminal. We want him back on his throne,” says villager Msokoli Maqondo. The Eastern Cape house of traditional leaders says it will work with the Abathembu Royal Family in its application for a presidential pardon King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo will be spending his first Christmas in four years with his family in this house. Although it is still not clear when he will ascend back to the throne, he is expected to meet the Abathembu nation on the 9 January 2020.  – Author- Lwandile Mbulali Watch the video below for more on the story:
