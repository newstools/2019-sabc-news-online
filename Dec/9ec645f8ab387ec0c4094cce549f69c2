The Democratic Alliance (DA) is drawing up legal documents to challenge the appointment of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) acting speaker, Obakeng Ramabodu as well as all the decisions taken after his appointment as Speaker in the Tshwane Council. DA provincial leader, John Moodey says they will bring the urgent court application as soon as possible. The DA contends it is illegal to elect an acting speaker when the Speaker as well as the City Manager is available to preside over a meeting. The Motion of No-Confidence in the Speaker, Katlego Mathebe was successful with the African National Congress and EFF voting for the motion and the DA refusing to vote. Moodey says the DA will not walk out of the meeting but will also not participate in an illegal process. Meanwhile, City of Tshwane Executive Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa has been booted out of his position by the ANC and EFF when their Motion of No-Confidence in the mayor succeeded in a council meeting on Thursday night. The ANC and EFF voted for the motion which succeeded with 111 votes. The DA and smaller parties did not vote or abstain. Click below to watch related video:
