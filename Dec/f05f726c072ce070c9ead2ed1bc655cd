African National Congress (ANC) Deputy President, David Mabuza says his meeting with the South African Communist Party (SACP), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) on the future of the alliance was fruitful. He was speaking at the 4th Special National Congress in Kempton Park east of Johannesburg. Delegates will discuss among others the possibility of the SACP going it alone in future elections. However, Â the ANC and its alliance partners have since developed a joint paper on the reconfiguration of the alliance. The paper, amongst others, proposed a joint deployment committee after Cosatu and the SACP complained that its members had been side-lined. Mabuza says they have now resolved to work together. Meanwhile, he has described the ongoing power crisis in the country as extremely worrying. For the past few days, Eskom has been implementing Stage 4 load shedding. There are fears that this could be ramped up to Stage 6 if the situation does not improve. Click below to watch related video:
