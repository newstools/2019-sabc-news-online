The Automobile Association says motorists can expect a mixed bag of fuel prices this month with petrol due to be hiked and diesel prices to decrease on Wednesday. The official fuel price adjustment is expected to be announced by the Department of Energy soon. AA spokesperson, Layton Beard, says the petrol price hike will affect many holidaymakers. “So the official announcement, by the Department of Energy, hasn’t been made yet – and should come through later today or tomorrow morning. The price will be adjusted on Wednesday, and the confusion is that petrol is going up, and diesel going down. So our prediction is diesel is going down by about 18 cents a litre, and petrol up- by about 19 cents a litre. So it is not great news for those travellers going travelling later this month, but for the manufacturing and agriculture sector not too bad because diesel is coming down.”
