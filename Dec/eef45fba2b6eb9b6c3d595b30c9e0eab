Justice and Correctional Services Committee Chairperson, Bulelani Magwanishe, says it’s not a serious setback that a deputy Public Protector has not yet been appointed. The term of office of the former Deputy Public Protector, Kevin Malunga, came to an end on 9 December. Earlier in December, the National Assembly approved the committee’s recommendation that Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka be appointed as the new deputy. Gcaleka is former legal advisor to former Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba. Magwanishe says it is now up to the President to consider the appointment. “Any public power that is given to a public official, it means that you are not rubber stamping. You have to apply your mind also. It’s like legislation. Once they are approved by the two Houses, they go to the President for assent. He does not just sign. He has to show that he has applied his mind. As the legislative branch we have made our work, we have done the recommendation, so by law he has to sign it off, so that means he has to apply his mind,” says Magwanishe.
