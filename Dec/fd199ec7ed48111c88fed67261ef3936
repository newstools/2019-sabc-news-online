Forty-year-old Anele Hoyana is being buried in East London on Saturday. His murder, allegedly at the hands of his friend Fritz Joubert, made headlines last week. A video about the assault by Joubert on him was circulated widely. The circumstances surrounding the lead-up to and his murder are still being investigated. His brother, Olwethu, says much was expected of Anele as he just recently registered his own facilities management company. “We are fine.  We have received thousands of messages from all over the country who have felt our pain equally. We have been humbled, we feel better and we are at the last leg of a very difficult week.” WATCH BELOW:
