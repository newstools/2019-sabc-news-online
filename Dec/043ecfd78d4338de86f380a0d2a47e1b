The man who was murdered allegedly by his friend in the Eastern Cape has been buried at his home in Kwelerha in East London.  Anele Hoyana‘s murder allegedly at the hands of his friend, Fritz Joubert, made headlines last week and a video went viral on social media. Police are still piecing together the circumstances surrounding the incident. At the time of his murder, Hoyana was living on Joubert’s small-holding whilst training to become a sangoma. It was an emotional send off for the late Anele Hoyana. He was described as a humble and soft-spoken person.  Hoyana had plans of becoming a successful entrepreneur and recently registered his own company. His brother, Olwethu Hoyana, says they are struggling to come to terms with his death.  “We are fine, we have received thousands of messages from all over the country who have felt our pain equally, we have been humbled, we feel better and we are at the last leg of a very difficult week.” Speaking at the funeral, Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane highlighted that society needs to deal with racism and seek social cohesion.   “We are really battling racism in our country. The government is in pursuit of a united non-racial, non-sexist democratic and prosperous country. We would want to focus on that and really make everyone to be part of that particular programme for us to have a country where black and white live together in harmony.” Hoyana is survived by a fiancée, three children, parents and three sisters.
