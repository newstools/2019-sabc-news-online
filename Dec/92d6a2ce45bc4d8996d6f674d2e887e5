The Hawks have confirmed that they have arrested suspected domestic terrorist Riana Heymans, along with two people who are believed to have been harbouring her. Heymans is a member of the National Christian Resistance Movement believed to have been planning attacks on national key points, shopping malls, and informal settlements across the country. Earlier in the week the group’s self-professed leader Harry Knoesen, a retired pastor and former SANDF member, was arrested on terrorism charges – and is expected to appear at the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says, “She was arrested with two other people, whom we believe were harbouring her in the Vaal area, Kilprivier, to be exact. She has been transported to Middelburg, where, together with the other two, will be appearing with Mr Knoesen…” “Some of the items that were confiscated include firearms, documents – which are subject now for investigation. We are hoping that we will be able to oppose bail,” added Mulaudzi.
