The People’s United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) in the Kingdom of eSwatini has condemned the alleged harassment and arrest of political leaders in that country. Pudemo’s deputy president Zodwa Mkhonta says police confiscated documents, cell phones and laptops from their political leaders. She accuses the eSwatini government of trying to suppress political organisations who are calling for reforms. “The police came this morning at 5 am and are collecting all progressive party leaders. Right now we have information that they have taken comrade Wandile Dhludhlu who is the secretary-general of Pudemo and comrade Sibongile Mazibuko who is the president of the Ngwane National Liberation Congress. Comrade D.U Fakude who is the national chairperson of the communist party of Swaziland,” says Mkhonta.
