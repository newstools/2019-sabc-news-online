The former speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete is visiting heritage sites in the Eastern Cape to honour the national icons as part of Reconciliation Day. She is expected to visit the burial sites of stalwarts like Steve Biko and the Reverend Tiyo Soga. Mbete says it is important to pay respect to such icons on this day. “We are reflecting on history, what happened on this day, its significance in our time. We are also celebrating our heritage because the things that happened whether it be the fight against the colonisers as well as reconciliation. The theme of reconciliation means when we constantly go back to those events it reminds us and it re-inspires us for continuously living our life with pride because that’s who we must be, we must be proud in those things that were done by our forebearers.”
