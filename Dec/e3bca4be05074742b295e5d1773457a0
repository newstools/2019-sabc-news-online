The Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has seized scheduled skin medicines and unregistered skin lightening products worth around R3 million in the Durban CBD. It was part of the festive season clean-up operations. The Authority’s Masilo Mopai says one person was arrested for contravention of the Medicines Act. “There was a shop that was selling schedule medicines as well as skin lightness creams and unregistered products. This is part of awareness to the community to say to them please make sure that you are buying medicine at a registered facility that will be your pharmacy or at a doctor’s practice. The medicines that are found here mostly are sold on a prescription and some are banned totally. They are not supposed to be sold in South Africa in terms of the Medicines Act.”
