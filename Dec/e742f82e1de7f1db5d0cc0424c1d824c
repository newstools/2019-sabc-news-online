Eskom says it does not anticipate any load shedding on Friday due to a drop in the demand for power during the holiday period. The power utility however says its system remains vulnerable and unpredictable, and the possibility of load shedding still remains. Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says customers are urged to reduce electricity usage. “Today as of 6:30 am, unplanned breakdowns were sitting at 13, 154 Megawatts. Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation and to carry out planned maintenance, and to work at reducing these unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500 Megawatts in order to enable us to minimise the possibility of load shedding.”
