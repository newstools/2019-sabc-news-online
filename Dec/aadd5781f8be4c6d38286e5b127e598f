A woman has been shot and killed in the Killarney Mall, north of Johannesburg on Tuesday afternoon. It’s alleged that a man opened fire before killing himself. Reports suggest that the incident could be linked to domestic violence. Police are investigating a case of murder and another of suicide. Police Spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters says, “Preliminary reports from the scene reveal that a man, whose age is estimated between 40 and 45, walked into a shoe-and-bag store at the mall where there were two employees. He introduced himself to the one employee and then requested to speak in private to the second employee whom he had claimed was his wife. The man and woman allegedly then moved to a private space and within no time gunshots were heard. Paramedics arrived at the scene and declared both the 35-year old woman and the man dead.”
