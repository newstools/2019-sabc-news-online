Motorists in Cape Town have welcomed plans to tighten security on the roads in the Western Cape this festive period. The Festive Period Road Safety Plan for the province has been launched. The event took place at the busy Huguenot Tunnel on the N1 near Paarl in the Boland on Thursday. Premier Alan Winde has called on motorists to adhere to the rules of the road at all times. Various roadblocks have been planned on the province’s roads during the summer holidays. Traffic officials will also check for driver fitness and alcohol consumption. “I don’t drink as you can see I am with my family, I don’t drink when I am on the road. If everybody drove drunk, it’s a problem. I think we are fortunate now with businesses like Uber and Taxify that we can use to get around town without having to drink and drive. There is no excuse really to drink and drive with those kinds of businesses in place,”  says one of the road users.
