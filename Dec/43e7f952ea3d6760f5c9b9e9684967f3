KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says government will provide mining giant Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) with reinforced security when it re-opens. The mine was forced to shut down last month after conflicts between miners and the community left one person dead. A second person, Meshack Mbuyazi, was gunned down in his car shortly after attending a meeting that Zikalala had called to address instability in the surrounding community. RMB employs about 5 000 local people. Zikalala says a special team has already been deployed to the area to ensure stability. “Government is common territory to ensuring that this situation does not get our off hand and is properly addressed. The team will mediate and try to resolve the issue of kwaMbuyazi. Government wishes to create a conducive environment that will ensure that all operations resumes smoothly in the New Year. We have put a structure right now that is supporting RBM. Police are there. There is an arrangement that we have put in place to ensure that RBM is open and can operate.”
