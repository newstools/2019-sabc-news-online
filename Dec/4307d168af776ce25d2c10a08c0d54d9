The waiting period for restoring water to areas affected by the damage to a 210-metre raw water supply pipe at the Wilge Dam, east of Pretoria, will be reduced to at least a few weeks. This is according to Acting Mayor Abel Tau. The damage was caused by the recent torrential rains and has affected communities of Cullinan, Rayton, Refilwe, Petra Diamond Mine and the Zonderwater Prison. Tau says the city is working with stakeholders in a bid to speedily restore water supply to the affected areas. “The engine as I was saying, it’s eight months, originally … to restore the pump station to its original state. But what we have since done is that we’ve spoken with the mine who are willing to go deep into their pockets to ensure that we’ve got a temporary pump station that can help us reticulate water within the next two weeks. I have pushed them hard to say by Christmas they should have water running.” Meanwhile, affected residents say they are struggling to cope. “Actually, we haven’t been coping because number one, we have problems with toilets,” says one of the residents.
