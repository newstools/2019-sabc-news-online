A delegation led by Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has visited the All Saints Hospital at Ngcobo where a number of initiates were hospitalised due to illegal circumcisions. Mabuyane has described as disappointing the situation he found at the hospital, where some initiates are under 18 years-old. It is illegal for people younger than 18 to undergo the process. The premier then visited an initiation school at Qutubeni village with over 30 initiates. The visit was to assess compliance with the traditional initiation protocols like age, the legality of the initiation school, parental consent and health and fitness of initiates.
