Eskom board and management will on Wednesday brief President Cyril Ramaphosa on the deepening power crisis in the country. Ramaphosa will also visit the power utility’s operations centre at Megawatt Park in Sunninghill, Johannesburg.   There’s public interest in what action Ramaphosa plans to take to mitigate the impact of load shedding on the already ailing economy. He cut short his working visit to Egypt after facing criticism for being away at a time that Eskom escalated load shedding to an unprecedented stage six. Chief economist at Econometrix, Azar Jammine, says small business owners will struggle to recover. “The problem with small businesses in many instances is that when they lose activity now due to load shedding they can’t make it up. Think of a restaurant that loses its clientele, think of sellers of food whose food gets rotten because they have no proper refrigeration. Think of the poor small informal businesses as well, who have no lighting to actually set up their stores and sell their activities, if they are dependent on a small cooking business. They could also suffer,” explains Jammine. Watch related video below:
