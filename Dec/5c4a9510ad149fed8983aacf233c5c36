Firefighters have contained a huge fire after a Jetfuel pipeline exploded in Alberton, east of Johannesburg. The number of people living in nearby Verwoerd Park that had to be evacuated has increased to thirty. They are currently being accommodated at a nearby community hall in Alberton.  No injuries have been reported and no one had to be treated for smoke inhalation. “There are two pipelines that are running parallel.  The one is for petrol and the other is for Jetfuel. Jetfuel is the petrol we use for aircrafts. That’s the one that has been affected.  By now the fire is under control. We are putting on foam to cover the fire so that is must not spread,” says Eric Maloka, Ekurhuleni Emergency Services Spokesperson.
