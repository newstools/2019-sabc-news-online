The City of Cape Town’s Law Enforcement Liquor Unit has confiscated nearly 7500 bottles of liquor since the beginning of December. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says in terms of the City’s by-laws, the consumption of alcohol on beaches and other public spaces is prohibited. Anyone caught doing so, has their alcohol confiscated and receives a R500 fine. They can reclaim the impounded liquor after paying the fine and a R650 impoundment release fee. Smith says what makes the situation worse is that guilty parties have attacked Law Enforcement officials in the execution of their duties. He says far too many people seem to think alcohol abuse is acceptable.
