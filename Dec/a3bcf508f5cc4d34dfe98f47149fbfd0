The National Assembly has passed a resolution that former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Nomgcobo Jiba and Special Director of Public Prosecutions Lawrence Mrwebi should not be reinstated. This follows the tabling by the Justice and Correctional Services Committee of its report to the Assembly for approval. However, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) did not support the report. Presenting the report to the House, Justice Committee Chairperson Bulelani Magwanishe said President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to fire Jiba and Mrwebi was correct as it was done in terms of the NPA Act. “In reaching its findings the committee considered whether the President had complied with the requirements of section 12, sub section 6 (a) and (b) of the Act and whether the process was fair. Informed by the documentation supplied to us, the view of the majority in the committee is that the President has followed the prescripts of the law in reaching his decision to remove advocate Jiba and Adv Mrwebi from office,” says Magwanishe.
