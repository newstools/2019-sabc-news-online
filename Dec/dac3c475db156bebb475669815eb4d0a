Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has closed investigations against Baleka Mbete as a Gold Fields shareholder, on allegations that she received a bribe of R25 million. Mkhwebane says the probe is closed on the grounds that allegations were unsubstantiated. A New York-based law firm, commissioned by Gold Fields to investigate its BEE deal, found in 2013 that the company had hugely increased Mbete’s cut in the controversial 2010 empowerment deal in Gold Fields, one of the world’s biggest gold mining companies. However, the lawyers made no findings against Mbete. Mkhwebane has been releasing several reports. “We will start with the investigations that we have closed on the grounds that the allegations that triggered them were all unsubstantiated as part of our efforts to clear the backlog, they are cases dating two-years back.” “The matters relates to the improper receipt of bribes by Mbete in the form of money amounting to R25 million in Victors Gold Limited. As well as the role played by Mineral Resources in 2010 BEE concluded with Gold Field Ltd. So this matter has been closed.” Click video below:
