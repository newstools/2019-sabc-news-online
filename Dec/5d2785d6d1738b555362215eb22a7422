Durban Metro Police say one person was stabbed to death and another seriously injured over the long weekend at the Durban beachfront. It is believed that the incidents were related to excessive drinking. One of those arrested is an alleged drunk driver who ran over a metro officer. Authorities say a total of 66 people have been arrested for drink-related cases since the start of the festive season in the city. Durban Metro spokesperson Parboo Sewparsad has raised concern over the increasing number of underage drinking. Sewparsad says the city is enforcing a zero-tolerance attitude towards drunk driving and public drinking. “The metro police received a call between midnight and 4 of clock this morning. The location was near the horseshoe parking on the beachfront. There were two people stabbed and there was a mob of drunken people around them. We have intensified our law enforcement operation, planned and unplanned operations, also undercover operations. We will be conducting stop and search. We believe that alcohol abuse attributed to most of the bad behaviour on the beachfront so we will be conducting stop and searches,” says Sewparsad. Holiday-makers say they feel safe with both police and lifeguards maintaining high visibility. “I’m from Thembisa Sangweni section. I came here to the beach to enjoy it. About the safety, I see police all over. From entering the town there is police presence. Everywhere there are police. Other roads are closed for safety.” “Durban has been exciting so far I can see the vibe. I can see people. They came from a different province. I see people from Joburg. It’s nice everyone is enjoying this festive,”  some holiday-makers say.
