The High Court in Pretoria is expected to hand down judgement in the application by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to set aside the Tshwane Metro councilâ€™s recent decision to remove DA mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa and Speaker Katlego Mathebe from office. The African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) cooperated during a controversial council sitting where a motion of no-confidence was passed against the mayor and speaker. The DA maintains that the process was flawed and wants the court to reverse the decision. Watch a related video below:
