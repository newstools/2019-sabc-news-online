Eskom has again urged people to consult with the utilityâ€™s website, app or toll-free number to see when they are affected by loadshedding. The country is enduring a third day of loadshedding, with stage two power cuts being implemented. Eskom says it has made some progress in reducing unplanned breakdowns but stage two loadshedding will continue on Saturday until 11pm. The power utility says they have also made improvements in handling wet coal. Eskom has managed to cut down demand from 12 000mw to 11000mw which has put an ease on the system. On Friday the power monopoly implemented stage four loadshedding amid constrained supply. People can check the schedules on the www.loadshedding.eskom.co.za website, dial 086 003 7566 or download the MyEskom app.
