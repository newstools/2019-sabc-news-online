The family of the first secretary-general of the African National Congress, known then as the South African Native National Congress, Solomon Plaatje, has expressed hurt and disappointment at the Northern Cape Department of Arts and Culture for refurbishing his grave without their permission. The department refurbished the grave of the struggle stalwart as part of the Mayibuye Liberation Route project allegedly without permission from the family. His great grandson, Sebeka Plaatje says the icon’s legacy is being treated with disdain. “We are entirely not happy, disgusted by the developments around this matter. More so the callous manner which this thing is taking form, we feel very much disrespected. We feel violated by this gesture of whoever is trying to do this, for not only taking our family seriously and also the nerve of putting a person and an icon like Sol Plaatje in a locked cage, we do not accept that,” says Sebeka Plaatje. This is not the first time the family has complained about the lack of consultation but the department insists this time around it made its plans clear to the family, alleging there are minutes to prove it. Provincial Arts and Culture spokesperson, Conrad Fortune explains, “We are not sure how come things are unfolding the way they are but we are obviously open for discussion with the family to amend. If they have different views in terms of what we understood and see how we can rectify it.”
