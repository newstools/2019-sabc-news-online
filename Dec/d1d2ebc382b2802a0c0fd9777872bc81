The seven people, who were brutally murdered at their home in Mpumalanga Township, west of Durban, earlier this month, are being laid to rest on Sunday. Six of the deceased are from the same family while the seventh is a neighbour. Three other people including a three-year-old child survived the attack. The family was attacked by unknown men who opened fire through the windows. Amongst the mourners is KwaZulu-Natal’s MEC for Transport Community Safety and Liaison, Bheki Ntuli. Department spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane says no arrests have been made and investigations are still underway. “Whilst the murder of the seven people is still subject to investigation. It is clear that the area of Hammarsdale has been engulfed by mass killings which have been taking place in the recent past. When the MEC visited the area, I was of the things that he discovered is the issue of ensuring that resources are deployed in the area.”
