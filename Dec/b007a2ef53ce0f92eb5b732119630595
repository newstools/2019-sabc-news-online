The Department of Women, Children and People with Disabilities says the criminal justice system is failing to meet the needs of the victims of Gender-Based and Intimate Partner Violence. The Department says many South African women do not understand aspects of the criminal justice system. This emerged during a panel discussion organised by the Commission for Gender Equality in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Thursday, on why women withdraw cases of violence against their partners. Activists say the system is not victim-centered. Pumeza Mafani is a survivor of Intimate Partner Violence and a Director in the Department of Women, Children and People with Disabilities. “I had opted for diversion which is a restorative justice option as opposed to the punitive and I realised then that women don’t know about the different approaches to the criminal justice system. If you take that road then you are seen as failing women and it is seen as a withdrawal rather than a different approach. What I found is that the system is designed as a one size fits all.”
