City of Cape Town law enforcement officers are investigating the discovery of a large number of sharks on the beach at Strandfontein on the West Coast on Sunday morning. They say their heads, dorsal fins and tails have been severed. Shark fins are targets for poachers as they fetch a high price on the market and are used in delicacies overseas. Metro Police Spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, says it is unclear who dumped the shark car cases there. “On arrival, the officers noticed the heads, dorsal fins and tails of the fish were severed. The fish were identified as a deep water shark species and it was thought to have been dumped there. The circumstances around this incident will be investigated,” says Dyason.
