The High Court in Pretoria has dismissed a special plea application brought by former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni to remove the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) from a delinquency case against her. Outa and the South African Pilots’ Association (SAPA) brought the case to have Myeni declared as a delinquent director – saying they want her to be stopped from sitting on the boards of any company. Handing down judgment, Judge Ronel Tolmay says the trial is set to resume on the January 27, 2019. “In the light of all the facts, I am of the view that the special plea should be dismissed, and OUTA should be granted leave to bring the action in terms of Section 1571 D of the Act, together with SAPA. The first defendant is ordered to pay the wasted cost, and the first defendant is to pay the cost of the amendment and join the application as well as the cost of the special plea.”
