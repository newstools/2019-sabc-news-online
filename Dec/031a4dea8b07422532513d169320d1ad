A reward of R100 000 has been offered for information that will secure the conviction of the four men suspected of setting alight two trains on Friday morning at Cape Town Station. Four complete train sets were destroyed. The damage is estimated at R61 million. Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has appealed to the public to help confirm the identity of the four suspects who are shown on security cameras torching the trains. Prasa says there is no justification for destroying state assets and inconveniencing thousands of commuters. Platforms 10 to 19 remain closed. Meanwhile, the City of Cape Townâ€™s Transport Portfolio Chairperson, Angus McKenzie, has called for the removal of the Western Cape Regional Head of Prasa. McKenzie says Richard Walker must be held accountable for the current state of the railway system that has seen a loss of millions of rand and 140 train carriages in three years due to suspicious fires. His call comes after the latest fire at the Cape Town railway station on Thursday, in which 18 coaches were destroyed. McKenzie says the railway has been crippled.
