The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) has called for South African Airways (SAA) to begin a process of rooting out corruption at management level, saying it is crucial for the survival of the national carrier. This after Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan announced that a radical restructuring process will help ensure SAA’s financial and operational sustainability. He says last month’s strike by members affiliated to NUMSA and SACCA has caused immense damage to SAA’s reputation, operations, and finances. SACCA President, Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi, however, claims that the SAA leadership may be protecting corrupt elements “Someone needs to commit to the fact that they are going to deal with corruption. We have a measure in place, which is the task team that can hone into these issues. We had a restructuring officer from the UK at 6 million a month, and did absolutely nothing. We believe SAA is still corrupt. With corrupt management and leadership, where are we really going? That needs to be dealt with. There seems to be a protection of certain corrupt forces which we don’t take lightly to. Who are going to be on the firing line – our members!” SACCA has raised concerns over SAA failing to announce rooting out corruption as part of their radical restructuring process. Nsibanyoni-Mugambi, says SAA needs to commit towards a non-corrupt leadership.  Click link below for more on the story:
