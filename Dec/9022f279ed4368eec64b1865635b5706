Convicted Nigerian terrorist Henry Okah, will on Friday know the fate of his application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. This after the High Court in Pretoria reserved judgment earlier this month. The High Court in Johannesburg sentenced Okah to 24 years imprisonment in March 2013 after convicting him of 13 counts of terrorism in his country of origin. He was convicted of detonating two car bombs in Nigeria in 2010 during the anniversary of that country’s independence. The incident left 12 people dead and 36 others wounded. In another incident, one person was killed and 11 others wounded when two car bombs went off. During his last court appearance Okah who represented himself, questioned South Africa’s jurisdiction in the crime he is accused of. He insists that based on an agreement between Nigeria and South Africa he should only be prosecuted under the ICC Act.
