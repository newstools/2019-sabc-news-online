The former Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani has lost his bid to have his application heard urgently. Bobani filed an urgent application in the Port Elizabeth High Court for an interim relief – and have his ousting overturned. He was removed through a motion of no confidence during a Council Meeting two weeks back. In her ruling Acting Justice Lisa Ntsepe says the matter is not urgent and has dismissed it with costs. Bobani was ousted on 5th December during a council meeting through a motion of no confidence. He had survived a total of five motions of no confidence. He was seeking interim relief to be reinstated on the grounds that his removal was illegal, as he only received a notice of the motion four days before the council meeting. According to him, he was supposed to receive it five days before the sitting. He says the motion of no confidence, that was used to remove him, was elevated from the Special Council Meeting to an Ordinary Meeting which is also illegal. The Democratic Alliance (DA), which tabled the motion of no confidence against Bobani, is opposing the application and wants the matter struck off the roll. – Report by Mcebisi Ngqina  WATCH BELOW FOR RELATED VIDEO:
