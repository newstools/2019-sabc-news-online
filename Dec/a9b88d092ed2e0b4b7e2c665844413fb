The Congress of the People (COPE) says the five SANPark rangers who were involved in a violent altercation with top South African cyclist Nic Dlamini should be charged with assault. Dlamini broke his arm during the incident on Friday at the Silvermine Nature Reserve, near Muizenberg in Cape Town. Warning: tweet below contains a video that may be disturbing to some viewers:   “We are saying that this is totally unacceptable, that the value and life of a human being have become so cheap in South Africa. We are calling upon the parents and the manager of Nicholas to go to the nearest police station and lay a charge of grievous bodily harm (GBH) against these five rangers who have assaulted this person in a violent manner,” says COPE’s spokesperson Dennis Bloom. Dlamini is expected to be discharged from the hospital on Sunday after undergoing surgery.
