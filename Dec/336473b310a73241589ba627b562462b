Gauteng Premier David Makhura has warned residents of Mamelodi in Pretoria not to return to flood-prone areas along rivers. Hundreds of people lost their homes in the Eerste Fabrike area, along the Moretele River during the floods. Several displaced Mamelodi families are still staying at temporary shelters. At least two people have been confirmed dead in the floods. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to visit the area on Wednesday. Makhura has assured Mamelodi residents that the provincial government will help those who lost their belongings. “Since this happened, we have been providing the affected members of the community, as I said they are 1300 people affected. We have been providing them with food on a daily basis, also been providing them with blankets on a daily basis, but we want to work with them quickly to normalise things.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
