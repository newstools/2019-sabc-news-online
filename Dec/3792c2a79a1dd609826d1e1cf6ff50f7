The Overberg District Municipality says the fire that started in the Greyton Nature Reserve last week has incurred firefighting and damage costs conservatively estimated at well over R15 million. Fire Chief Reinard Geldenhuys says good progress is being made in the investigation to identify those responsible. Itâ€™s believed that two boys started the fire. Geldenhuys says their survey determined that five structures were lost, including two homes. The burn areas around Greyton and Genadendal have been extinguished and mopping up will continue on Thursday. Drone technology will be used to determine hot spots. Geldenhuys says the head of the fire is however still active close to Riversonderend, while another fire is burning high up in the Baviaanskloof north of Genadendal. Fresh teams of firefighters will be deployed this morning to monitor the situation.  Watch the video below for related news:
