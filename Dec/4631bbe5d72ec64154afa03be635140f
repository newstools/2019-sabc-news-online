The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) says it’s ready to defend itself in the case that former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni has brought against it. Myeni has filed court papers suing OUTA for R8-million, claiming that it has damaged her reputation. OUTA wants the High Court in Pretoria to declare Myeni a delinquent director due to the airline’s dire financial situation. On Tuesday, the court dismissed Myeni’s application to have her former colleagues in the parastatal’s board joined with her in the on-going case which OUTA has brought to have her declared a delinquent company director. The court also rejected Myeni’s application to amend her statement. Her legal team said she may have been misled by her previous lawyers. Head of Legal Affairs at OUTA Advocate Stefanie Fick says, “We’re looking forward to being served the papers so that we can see what this is about. Obviously we are going to read them. I’m quite sure that we’ll vigorously defend it and we’re looking forward to it.” Click on the video below:
