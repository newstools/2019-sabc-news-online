The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it is investigating the details surrounding photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed’s escape from captivity in Syria. Spokesperson for the Department Lunga Nqengelele says, “Through our consular services, we are looking into the matter and we will only be able to comment at a later stage when we have been able to verify the whereabouts of Mr Shiraaz Mohamed.” Mohamed was kidnapped while on assignment in the war-torn country in January of 2017. Humanitarian organisation, Gift of the Givers, says it was informed of his escape by an unknown person, who also sent two photographs of Mohamed on Saturday. The anonymous source claims Mohamed is in the custody of the Turkish intelligence. Gift of the Givers alerted both Dirco and Mohamed’s family. The family is treating the news with caution, saying it will comment once it has verified the journalist’s safety.
