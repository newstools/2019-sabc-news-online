Eskom says it has made some progress in reducing unplanned breakdowns but stage 2 load shedding will continue until 11pm Saturday. The power utility says they have also made improvements in handling wet coal. Eskom has managed to cut down demand from 12 000 megawatts to 11 000 megawatts which has put an ease on the system. Meanwhile,  the DA says if load shedding persists it may plunge the economy into a recession. The power utility on Thursday announced that it was starting with load shedding because of a constrained system. People have been advised to check the load shedding schedule on Eskom’s website. DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, Ghaleb Cachalia says: “Load shedding affects the lifeblood of our economy, it affects our citizens, it affects our industries, it affects our commercial enterprises.” “This could push us into recession very, very easily.” “Eskom is run like a secret enterprise. The nation has to be taken into its confidence. They have to tell us what they’re doing, when they’re doing it, and how they’re doing it. “We have to make sure that we fix this country and we can fix this country only if we fix Eskom,” adds Cachalia.
