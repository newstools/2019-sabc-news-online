Cross border crimes that include smuggling of counterfeit products and stolen cars, remain a huge challenge at the Kopfontein Border Post between South Africa and Botswana. This emerged during a visit by the Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi. His visit is part of the Department’s plans to monitor the smooth movement of travelers over the festive season. The Kopfontein Border Post, which is about 60 kilometres from Zeerust in the North West, is expected to experience increased numbers of travellers as well as delivery vehicles over the festive season. Some of those crossing from Botswana to South Africa have expressed mixed feelings about the service. Mlungizi Mkhize from Kwazulu-Natal says crossing to Botswana with kids for the first time, he experienced a huge challenge. He was forced to return to ensure he had the proper documents to take the children out of the country. “We went to Home Affairs. They didn’t tell us anything about having to apply for the unabridged birth certificate. We went to the police station to make the affidavit. Now, we are told to drive back to South Africa to get other documents,” says Mkhize. The department has deployed at least 400 additional immigration staff in all ports across the country. “There are always challenges at the border, from correct documentation or people trying to smuggle things through. A truck which has been detained here smuggling cigarettes and the other is suspected to be smuggling goods. This office is usually run by 30 people. We have send 12 extra people for this festive season,” says Motsoaledi. The minister says they are also in negotiations with his counterparts in Botswana to upgrade the border post soon.
