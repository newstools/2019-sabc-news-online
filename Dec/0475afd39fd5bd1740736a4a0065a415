There’s public interest in what action President Cyril Ramaphosa plans to take to mitigate the impact of load shedding on the already ailing economy. On Wednesday, the  Eskom board and management will brief President Ramaphosa,  who will also visit the power utility’s operations centre at Megawatt Park in Sunninghill, Johannesburg. President Ramaphosa has cut short his working visit to Egypt to deal with the deepening power crisis in the country. He faced criticism for being away at a time that Eskom escalated load shedding to an unprecedented stage six. The load shedding has since been adjusted to stage two. Eskom deputy spokesperson Dikatso Mothae has warned that the probability for load shedding remains high for the rest of the week. “We are still at stage four, we’re stable at stage four, we do not believe that we’ll need to be higher than that today and we’re constantly monitoring the system and we’ll be in a better place to advise what will happen tomorrow.”
