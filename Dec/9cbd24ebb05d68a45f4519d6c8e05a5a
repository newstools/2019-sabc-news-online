The court battle over former President Jacob Zuma’s personal legal costs is far from over. Zuma has filed papers in the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), arguing that it is unfair to withhold state legal funds for his litigation. Zuma is appealing the December 2018 High Court ruling of a personal costs order against him. It relates to his failed bid to review the remedial action of the state of capture report. In papers before the SCA, Zuma contends that there’s nothing untoward for the state to foot his legal bills. Zuma has also petitioned the Appeal Court in a bid to overturn the High Court judgment which dismissed his application for permanent stay of prosecution. That case relates to the multimillion-rand arms deal. Legal expert, Machini Motloung, “All that an accused person should bring to court is the unreasonable delay cost in bringing forth the charges against the accused person. As well as bring him to court and commencing the trial, you look at the reasons for the delay and look at the complexity of the matter.”
