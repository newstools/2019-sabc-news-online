The Department of Basic Education has warned the public against circulating fake news articles, which claim that the minimum pass requirements for school mathematics have been lowered to 20% for grades seven to nine. The department says any policy changes would be circulated via the appropriate channels, such as a government gazette or a circular. The department’s Spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, says the content of the articles were taken out of context. “It comes from news articles written by people who do not fully understand what they were writing about. These are old articles which have been circulated again when it is out of context. It was from complaints from parents and schools when they were facing a situation. So after discussions, the minister felt that it was important to put in place a special concession to allow for learners to at least achieve 20% – having passed all other subjects – to be allowed to go to the next grade at the time – it was not something that was going to be permanent,” says Mhlanga.
