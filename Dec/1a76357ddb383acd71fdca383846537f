The United Democratic Movement (UDM) in the Eastern Cape is mourning the death of one of its members. Ludwe Ntoni died in hospital in Alice at the age of 33 following a short illness. He was part of the organising committee of the previous mayor of the Nelson Mandela Metro, Mongameli Bobani, who was ousted in a vote of no confidence in November. UDM provincial secretary, Mabandla Gogo described Ntoni as a dedicated worker. “He was also a close assistant to Mr Bobani when Mr Bobani was the Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Metro. He was a very considerable politician who knew his role and who had the love of his political party the UDM at heart. We are told that he died of natural causes,” says Gogo.
