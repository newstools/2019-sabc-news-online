But the unions say they were not consulted. In a statement, Gordhan says there is no other way forward as the struggling airline canâ€™t continue in its current form. He says the November strike by unions, Numsa and the South African Cabin Crew Association has caused immense damage to the reputation, operations, and the deterioration of the finances of SAA. Gordhan, however, stresses that SAA remains open for business and has urged South Africans to support the airline in its efforts to restore sales confidence among and rebuild revenues in the shortest possible time.
