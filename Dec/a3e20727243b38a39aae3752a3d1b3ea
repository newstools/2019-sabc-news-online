Gauteng Premier David Makhura says he will ask the City of Johannesburg to prioritise putting up infrastructure in Ivory Park, east of Johannesburg, after a pedestrian bridge collapsed due to heavy rains on Sunday. Makhura visited the area on Thursday. An elderly woman was rescued after being trapped on the structure. “Poor communities where the infrastructure is not so strong are often affected by the slightest of flooding. We can also build our infrastructure in a way that helps. Strong stormwater systems are also very very important to be able to direct water where it’s required,” says Makhura Watch related videos below
