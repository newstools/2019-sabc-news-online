Gauteng premier David Makhura will on Thursday morning visit Ivory Park, east of Johannesburg, where a pedestrian bridge collapsed due to heavy rains on Sunday. An elderly woman had to be rescued after being trapped on the flooded man-made bridge after she tried crossing a flooded river stream. Makhura’s spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga says the premier wants to assess the extent of the damage and see what sort of assistance residents need. “At this moment we must make sure that people get the assistance they need, blankets and food.” “The infrastructure damage caused by the floods will also be assessed and that report will be coming. We will make sure that we execute our duties as the provincial government.”  WATCH BELOW RELATED VIDEO:
