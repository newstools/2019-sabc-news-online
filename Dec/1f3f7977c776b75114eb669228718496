The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has rejected the election of the African National Congress’s (ANC) Geoff Makhubo as the new Mayor of the City of Johannesburg. Makhubo won the vote with 137 votes (51.11%). He is also the ANC’s Johannesburg regional chair. The DA candidate received 101 votes (37.68%) while the EFF candidate tallied 30 votes (11.19%). There were 268 councillors present at Wednesday’s sitting. Herman Mashaba resigned as Johannesburg Mayor six weeks ago.  EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu says they will not support the leadership of Makhubo because he has been marred by serious allegations of corruption. “We not happy with the election of Geoff Makhubo as the mayor of Johannesburg. That doesn’t take away the concerns that he was working with a Gupta company. He has that relationship with them but also he was involved in a lot of other wrong things so we are not going to support the government of Makhubo because he is not trustworthy,” says Shivambu.
