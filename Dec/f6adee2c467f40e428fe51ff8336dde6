KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says more budgets should be allocated to help address the effects of natural disasters. The province has recently experienced severe thunderstorms accompanied by tornadoes. Over 15 000 people were affected in four municipalities leaving more than 30 dead. Preliminary reports suggest that the amount of damage is more than R560 million. Zikalala says those affected are receiving assistance. “135 injuries were reported. About 3072 households were affected. About 15540 people were affected. That’s the state this has affected our province. Government in partnership with many humanitarian organizations responded swiftly to these tragic developments. To date, a comprehensive beneficiary list has been concluded and departments are intervening accordingly,” says Zikalala.
