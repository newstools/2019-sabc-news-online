One person has been killed and three others injured when a house collapsed on them due to the heavy rains at Ntuzuma township north of Durban. Life Response paramedic spokesperson Leon Fourie says paramedics worked hard to retrieve the body of the deceased, who was trapped underneath the rubble. Residents in this area have been asked to evacuate due to landslides. Fourie says, “Three people managed to escape, one person sadly passed away on scene. Search and rescue workers managed to locate the body and managed to dig him out about 45 minutes. He was declared deceased on scene by Life Response paramedics.” “The area surrounding the house is saturated with water and further landslides are expected. Members in the area have been advised to evacuate the area,” adds Fourie
