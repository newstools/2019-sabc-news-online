The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP)  says no bail should be given to people on trial for murder. The party was reacting to the death of a 5-year-old boy in Lavender Hill on the Cape Flats last week. Valentino Grootetjie was struck by a stray bullet during a shootout between rival gangs outside his parents’ home. He was laid to rest on Saturday. Two suspects, aged 24 and 29, have appeared in court on charges of murder and attempted murder. They will apply for bail on the 23rd of January. ACDP MP, Marie Sukers, says bail must be opposed. “The biggest part of the solution for us in addressing the current violence, specifically when it comes to getting perpetrators off the streets, should be the first priority for us. Communities should work with the police, but we need to understand that communities are terrified. Those who are doing these acts of violence should not be left out on the streets. They should not get bail.”
