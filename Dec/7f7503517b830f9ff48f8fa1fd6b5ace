The City of Ekurhuleni has appealed to communities to report cable theft to the nearest police station when they see people stealing municipal property. A man was electrocuted in Primrose near Germiston, east of Johannesburg. The video of him went viral on social media. Ekurhuleni Emergency Services Spokesperson, William Ntladi, says the person was infringing with the substation. “The paramedics arrived on scene and they found him suffering partial thickness. 100% burn wounds. The person was actually infringing with some electrical cables in the substation. The area as we speak confirmed that it was experiencing a blackout in terms of power supply,” says Ntladi.
