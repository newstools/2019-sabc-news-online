The South African Weather Service says most parts of the country will continue experiencing cold and rainy conditions into the weekend. Temperatures are expected to range between 17 and 19 degrees in most provinces including Gauteng, Limpopo and the Free State. Forecaster Bransby Bhulo says, “Gauteng is in, as well as North-West province, Free State, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. As we speak it is quite cloudy with some light showers in places over those provinces.” Bhulo says, “Conditions are going to remain like this throughout the day as a result temperatures will be cool, with the maximum temperatures mostly ranging between 17 and 19 over these provinces. And again tomorrow (Saturday) as well as on Sunday there is a good chance of showers and thundershowers.”
