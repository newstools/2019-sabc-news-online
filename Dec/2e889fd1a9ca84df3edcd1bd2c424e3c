The broadcaster contends they were appointed without following proper procedures during the tenure of former Chief Operating Officer Hlaudi Motsweneng. The public broadcaster wants the court to declare the appointments unlawful and invalid. A packed courtroom, the 27 current and former SABC employees appearing with their lawyers. The SABC laid out its case before Judge J Moshoana. The public broadcaster says some of the employees were hired without having the necessary qualifications while others were promoted without applying for the positions. The SABC says the case is aimed at restoring corporate governance at the public broadcaster. But the union representing some of the employees insists the SABC does not have a strong case.
