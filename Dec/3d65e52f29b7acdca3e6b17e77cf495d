The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) has expressed concern over allegations of editorial interference and censorship at the ENCA news channel. Former ENCA Political Reporter, Samkele Maseko alleged that ENCA News Chief, Kanthan Pillay had censored stories in the newsroom. Maseko has since left the news channel. Sanef says media freedom is a critical part of a healthy democracy and should be fiercely protected by all South Africans. The Forum’s Executive Director, Kate Skinner says they will write to ENCA management to request a meeting and seek clarity on this matter. Skinner says, “We are trying to meet with ENCA. We have said that we need to meet as soon as possible to discuss these issues in depth. For us the issue is, we do not want censorship in the newsroom. We want journalists to report without fear or favour. So for us, it is very important to get to the bottom of these allegations because if there has been censorship in the newsroom we need to look at what happened and obviously how to prevent it from happening in the future.”
