The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is urging the public to be responsible when discharging fireworks and be mindful of animals. Many people will be welcoming the New Year on Tuesday night by firing fire crackers. However, there have been cases in the past where animals, especially dogs, have been injured after being fired upon by fire crackers. NSPCA spokesperson Meg Wilson says fire crackers have a detrimental effect on both wild and domestic animals. “Particularly birds that flee from their nest out of fear and often leave baby birds behind and can’t find their nest and often these baby birds starve to death. Dogs are particularly sensitive to fire crackers and often go into flight or fight mode. This means a dog needs to be secured in a secure environment where they can’t escape their homes to be made to be comfortable to put on soft music to reduce the noise impact of fire crackers.” Click on the related videos below:
