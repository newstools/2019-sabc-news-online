Zimbabwe says it is still receiving an uninterrupted power supply from Eskom despite increased load shedding in South Africa. Cash-strapped Zimbabwe is forced to rely on power imports because of low generation capacity from the Kariba hydro-electric power station where water levels are low. Zimbabwe’s Energy Minister Fortune Chasi says: “Should there be challenges, I have no doubt that South Africa will communicate that – to say that they are unable…” “As of now we have not received such communication.” “We are continuing to receive power in accordance with the undertakings that we made in our contract with them,” adds Chasi.
