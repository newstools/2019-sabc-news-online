National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has received a letter from the DA requesting proceedings to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane from office. The party’s Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone is requesting Modise to start the proceedings when Parliament resumes next year. In December, Parliament adopted new rules concerning the removal of office bearers at institutions supporting democracy, including the Public Protector. Parliament says the DA’s request will be considered in terms on these new rules. Mkhwebane has been under attack from the DA and various other sectors following some questionable decisions and damning court findings against her. Recently, the call was made by the party’s then Chief Whip and now interim leader, John Steenhuisen in the fifth Parliament. But, it was shelved after it transpired that Parliament doesn’t have rules in place to effect such a motion. Last week, the National Assembly adopted new rules for this purpose. The DA still maintains Mkhwebane is not fit to hold office. It relies on what it says are various damning court findings against her. The new rules, which were adopted by the National Assembly this week, entail the appointment of a panel which may consist of a judge, to determine if evidence exists against a head of a Chapter 9 institution, which warrants an investigation. These rules were tabled by Deputy Chief Whip of the ANC, Doris Dlakude, “Parliament and the political environment are not static. And the rules should be understood as living instruments. The Rules Committee has been seized with looking at reforms to improve the functioning of the House. In particular, to look at members’ statements and procedure to remove office bearers in institutions supporting democracy.”
