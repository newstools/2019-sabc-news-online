The Cape Winelands District Municipality (CWDM) says the fire lines on the mountains above McGregor have been contained and could be completely out later on Saturday. The Municipality says helicopters and 60 firefighters have made good progress in containing the wildfire in the mountains. CWDM spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto says, however, small flare-ups continue to occur and need immediate attention. She says the fire line on the Overberg is being closely monitored as there is a concern that the windy conditions could allow it to spread into the Winelands area. Itâ€™s estimated that more than 18 000 hectares of vegetation have burned. Otto says the only damage to property has been a guest cottage and some damage to a residential property. No injuries or loss of life have occurred. The Municipality says combating teams will, however, for the next day or so stay in the area to continue mopping-up and monitoring hotspots.
