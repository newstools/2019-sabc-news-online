Eskom will hold a meeting on Friday to determine whether load shedding will continue. On Thursday, the power utility implemented stage two load shedding from 16:00 due to a shortage of capacity and a highly constrained system. However load shedding has been suspended load shedding as of 05:00 on Friday morning. Eskom Deputy Spokesperson, Dikatso Mothael says, “ The system has been consistently constrained over a long period of time. We are having our emergency meeting and we’ll be in a better position to advise on how the rest of the week and the weekend will look like in terms of the load shedding.” Click below to watch related video:
