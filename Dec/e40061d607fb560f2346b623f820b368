Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, has encouraged all gun owners to participate in the firearms amnesty period, which kicked off on December 1 and runs until the end of May 2020. Gun owners who wish to surrender their firearms can do so at their nearest police station. So far, over 200 firearms and 2 000 rounds of ammunition have been surrendered. Firearms can be handed over at police stations from 07:00 until 17:00. All firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to determine if they have been used in the commission of any crime. During this period, gun owners with expired licenses can apply for new licenses. Cele says all illegal firearms can also be surrendered without fear of prosecution. Watch a related video below:
