Permanent repair work will start on the M1 south bridge at the Booysens off-ramp, south of Johannesburg, next month. The Johannesburg Roads Agency has assured motorists that the bridge is safe to use.  Paving blocks under the bridge were displaced after recent heavy rains.  The side of the road affected by the damage has been cordoned off. General Manager for the JRA Siyabonga Nodu says the repairs could not be done sooner because contractors have closed. “The repairs will indeed start next month. We could’ve done it sooner and we would have wanted to do it sooner but as you would know we have a situation where the contractors have closed and also the service providers have closed. However, our standby teams are the ones that are doing all the work at the current moment but its interim work to ensure the safety of road users under the bridge. Above the bridge, there is really nothing wrong with the structure. The road should be used as it was used before.” Click on the video below:
