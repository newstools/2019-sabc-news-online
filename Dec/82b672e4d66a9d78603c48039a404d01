The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is urging taxpayers who have not submitted their returns, to make use of the SARS MobiApp or eFiling system before the deadline for submissions on Wednesday. SARS has stressed that should the extended electronic filing period not be used, administrative penalties will be levied for every month the return is outstanding. The revenue service says that the non-filing of returns is a criminal offence. SARS spokesperson Janine Mqulwana says: “At this point only electronic filing via efiling or the SARS mobiapp using a smart phone is available.” “Filing over the counter at a SARS branch closed in October and should tax payers go to a branch at this point they will only be assisted with self help efiling options.” “Tax payers can be assured that using efiling as well as the SARS mobi app is extremely simple and all your information has already been loaded to verify is correct.”
