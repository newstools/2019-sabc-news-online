The battle for the control of the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality will continue in the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday morning. The Democratic Alliance (DA) brought an urgent application on December 6 in a bid to interdict the City of Tshwane from implementing the council’s resolution to oust mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa and speaker, Katlego Mathebe. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) had voted with the African National Congress (ANC) to remove Mokgalapa and Mathebe from office. On Tuesday, the matter was postponed to Thursday to allow the ANC to file replying papers. DA Gauteng Chairperson, Mike Moriarty says the two were illegally removed. “Do you not want to make a stand for the rule of law? Do you really want to allow a precedent to be set where if you don’t get your way you just physically pick up somebody and that’s what they did, they picked him up, they removed him from the room. Is that really tenable?” Both the ANC and the EFF have accused the DA of deliberately delaying the removal of the mayor and the speaker from office, which they say is inevitable. EFF Tshwane Chairperson, MoAfrika Mokgwabone says they followed all the rules when they removed Mokgalapa and Mathebe from office. “We came here as a majority of council to say that every, all the rules of council were followed  and we don’t have as majority of councillors the confidence in the mayor and we no longer have the confidence in the speaker.” Click below to watch related video:
