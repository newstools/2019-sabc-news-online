Good Samaritans have opened their hearts and wallets to help a struggling family of eight living in dire poverty in Section F, a sprawling settlement of Botshabelo, east of Bloemfontein. The goodwill gesture has been extended to the family after their plight was highlighted by the SABC News last Thursday. Life has been a struggle to the Mphulenyane family, comprising of eight members, all of them males. The youngest is 13 and the oldest is 43 years old. Two of the older brothers are both mentally-ill, which makes it difficult for them to find jobs. The Mphunyelanes have been surviving by means of hand-outs since the sad passing of their parents. Kamohelo Makhetha is one of the residents who was taken aback by the unfolding sad events in the Mphulenyane household. Because Christmas Day is the time of sharing and giving, Makhetha says the little he and fellow community members could do was to organise a decent meal for their less fortunate neighbours. “There are a lot of people here who are homeless. We are going out to a shopping complex around here in Botshabelo and we are going to help these guys with some lunch today.” And more help came in. Household necessities such as groceries, clothes and furniture were donated. Added to that, the “Help The Disadvantaged” organisation lived to their name and expectation. The organisation’s Mookho Ranko says the little they could do was to also feed other orphans in the area. “I feel excited and overwhelmed because we also come from disadvantaged families and helping others, it really brings joy to us seeing that their lives will change.” A relieved 20-year-old Pitso Mphulenyane had nothing but words of gratitude. “I want to thank all the people who came to our rescue. As you can see our house has been fitted with windows, beds and good things that we never had. All i can say is thank you.” More people have pledged to assist the family, including taking some of the minors to school next year. Watch related video below:
