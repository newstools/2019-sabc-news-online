Unions at South African Airways (SAA) have denied meeting with the airline’s business rescue practitioner Les Matuson despite reports to the contrary. They include the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA). The unions say they are committed to helping to save the airline which has been place under business rescue. Before SAA was placed under business rescue, unions had embarked on a week-long wage strike which reportedly cost the airline at least R50 million a day. SACCA secretary-general Mpho Moikangoa says no meeting has taken place between them and Matuson despite the business rescue process requiring that he meets with the workers. Moikangoa says: “We have not met with him, not at all. He is somebody that just meets with the board and takes a mandate from the board.” “I think the whole point is to try and make SAA work and to save the jobs.” “We have always maintained that we are able to assist and identify areas of savings and if he is not coming to the table and not talking to us as stakeholders, then it makes it difficult to work with him.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
