The South African Communist Party (SACP) has called for investigations into the procurement processes at SOEs including Eskom and South African Airways (SAA). This is part of the resolutions taken at the end of the party’s Fourth Special National Congress in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg. The SACP’s mid-term gathering was called to take stock of the implementation of the resolutions taken at the last congress in 2016. With the country still reeling from Eskom’s rolling blackouts and fears that SAA could be privatised – the SACP says these institutions are failing because of endemic corruption. SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande says they want investigations.
