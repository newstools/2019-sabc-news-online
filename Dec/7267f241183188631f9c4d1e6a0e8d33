Gauteng police have arrested over 850 people over the weekend for various crimes, including Africa Nkuna who escaped from the High Court in Johannesburg earlier in December. Police intercepted a minibus which Nkuna and his friend were travelling in around Kagiso, west of Johannesburg, before he was rearrested on Saturday. Charges of escaping from lawful custody and attempted murder will be added to the murder charge he is already facing. Meanwhile, Gauteng police Spokesperson, Mavela Masondo, says the 850 arrests are the results of the police’s Safer Festive Season Operation. “199 suspects were arrested in Johannesburg as police were conducting roadblocks as well as stop and searches. Drunk and driving topped the list as 39 offenders who have been found driving motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol were detained. The SAPS members in Ekurhuleni arrested more than 360 suspects for crime ranging from house robbery, rape, assault, malicious damage to property. Police were also visible in the streets of West Rand and Sedibeng where they conducted stop and searches,” says Masondo.
