Traffic has been peaking on the busy N4 road in Mpumalanga, as more than 500 vehicles have passed between Machado and the Nkomazi Toll Plaza per hour. The Department of Community, Safety, Security and Liaison says the N4, R40 and N17 in the province are experiencing high traffic volumes, as some travellers return home from their holidays ahead of the new year. Road users are being warned to be cautious due to rainy conditions across the province. Most motorists are pleased with road policing. “We are going to White River for a mini-vacation and the road is not busy, and they are managing the road very well,” says one motorist. “I’m from Rustenburg going to Maputo, Mozambique, and the road is not busy,” adds another. Law enforcement officers are out in their numbers. Drunk driving is still a major problem and about 95 people have died on the province’s roads over the festive season so far. “Traffic has peaked on the road since this afternoon. People are on the road going to their various locations to spend New Years. Traffic is expected to peak again tomorrow and on New Year’s Eve. But our law enforcement officers are on the road and so far have arrested 1200 for drinking and driving and road fatalities have gowned down,” says Mpumalanga Department of Road Safety and Security. Road users are warned to exercise caution as more rain has been forecast.  WATCH BELOW:
