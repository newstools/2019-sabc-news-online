The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State says it supports the move to possibly place the troubled Mangaung Metro under administration. This comes after Finance Deputy Minister, David Masondo wrote a letter to Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela in which he recommended that the Mangaung Metro be placed under administration. Masondo says the City’s financial records show conditional grants have been under-spent. The DA’s Mangaung Caucus Chairperson David Masweu has blamed the African National Congress (ANC) for the City’s dire financial state. “We know what the ANC does. They always send their cadres to come and intervene and when these people get here they do nothing other than continue to protect the interests of the party above the needs of the municipality. It is for this reason that we think that whilst we welcome it, we don’t think it will serve the purpose, because these are simple things to do. They need to look at these cadres they have employed, whether they are serving the purpose that they have been deployed to, and also whether they qualify to do the work that they are deployed for.”
