A group called the South African Water Warriors has facilitated its biggest drought relief effort yet at Prince Albert in the Karoo. A convoy of about 80 vehicles, including trucks, from Cape Town, Rustenburg and George brought water, fodder and groceries to assist drought-stricken farming communities. ” The donations are all from the public and not from SA Water Warriors. We just distribute it on behalf of the public. Thank you very much to each and every one that donated, whether you donated a tin of food, a can of water, transport, there is no difference in size,” says founder of SA Water Warriors, Deon Smit. A local farmer, Hennie Niehaus, has welcomed the assistance. “When the organiser told us that the project is huge, I didn’t know it could go big like this.  I speak on behalf of every farmer in Prince Albert, Leeu Gamka area, I want to thank everyone.” Watch related video below:
