Six people have been shot dead, and a three-year-old seriously injured in an attack at Mpumalanga township west of Durban. Five of the deceased are said to be from the same family while the sixth is believed to be a neighbour. It is alleged that the three family members who survived the attack told the police that they heard gunshots coming through the windows and door of their living room. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker says the motive for the killing is still unknown…. Nine members of a family were at the house in Mpumalanga watching TV, when they heard gun shots from the window and the door. Five of the family as well as a neighbour were fatally wounded – and a three year old child was rushed to the clinic. A number of shot guns and 9mm rounds were found at the crime scene. The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage and police are still conducting the investigation to establish what could be the motive.”
