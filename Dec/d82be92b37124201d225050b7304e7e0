The United Climate Change Conference, COP 25 kicks off on Monday in Madrid Spain. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has called on countries to bring definite action plans on how they will combat climate change. The two-week conference will see government delegations, environmental activists and civil society make presentations on their commitment to fighting the phenomena. In a press briefing on Sunday, Guterres called on world leaders, saying that not enough is being done to mitigate and adapt to climate change. He said targets set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement currently do not seem reachable and that political will is still lacking – especially in relation to the elimination of carbon and fossil fuel usage. The first day of COP25 will see Heads of State participate in a round table where they will share their ambitions of their country’s climate actions. On the side-lines – various discussions and panels will take place with a sharp focus on the role of young people fighting climate change. Watch related video below:
