The South African Weather Service says Capetonians hoping to spend some time at the beach on Friday will be able to do so rain-free. Cold and wet weather conditions have put a damper on the prospects of visiting beaches, but senior forecaster, Henning Grobbler says the rain will clear up later on Thursday. “It seems like the rain is gone for tomorrow (Friday) with the wind turning southeasterly. By tomorrow (Friday) afternoon there will be fairly strong southeasterly winds, clear skies with maximum temperatures that should be into the mid-twenties. Then going into Saturday, still that south-easterly wind in the afternoon, temperatures pick up into the mid to high twenties towards Saturday afternoon.”
