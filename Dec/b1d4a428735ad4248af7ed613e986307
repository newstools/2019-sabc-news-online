New Mayor of the City of Johannesburg, Geoff Makhubo has outlined some of his first priorities in his new position. He has addressed the media in Johannesburg. “We have to form a government first and get a handover report, access what’s happening. So, we will be hard at work working with the province and working nationally. But let me tell you, this first thing we are going to do, we will be focusing on servicing the people of Johannesburg. We were not phased. The EFF wants to remain kingmakers, we will do our best to service the people of Johannesburg.” Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance’s Mike Moriarty has expressed extreme disappointment over the appointment of the new Mayor. This follows the African National Congress’ candidate, Makhubo winning with 137 votes.  This means the key metro will now once again be governed by the ruling party, which it lost to a DA-led coalition government in the 2016 municipal elections. Makhubo was implicated in a tender fraud scam. His business allegedly received R30 million in a deal with the Gupta-linked Regiments Capital, but was later cleared. Moriarty has described today as a very sad day. “Well, I am not feeling particularly good. I feel very disappointed that there are councillors that saw it fit to vote in somebody who is thoroughly compromised with allegations of corruption. We all know about the R30 million contracts that he profited from the City of Johannesburg.” The Economic Freedom Fighters also rejected his election as Mayor. EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu says they will not support the leadership of Makhubo because he has been marred by serious allegations of corruption. Watch the video below for more on the story:
