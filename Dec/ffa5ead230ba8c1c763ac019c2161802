International law expert Gary Eisenberg says the United Arab Emirates (UAE) must play its part in helping with the extradition of the Gupta brothers to South Africa. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola is on a mission to persuade the UAE to extradite the Gupta brothers. Lamola has been attending the UN Convention against corruption in Abu Dhabi. The Guptas have been implicated in widespread corruption in South Africa. Eisenberg explains the importance of the extradition treaty between South Africa and the UAE: “This extradition treaty is really fundamental to the exercise. In other words, mutual co-operation and asset recovery in the existing convention has not worked. It’s lacked the political will on the part of the UAE to assist South Africa in fighting corruption, and the position now is we are waiting for the UAE to ratify it and sign it and to make it operational between the two countries.”  Watch related video:
