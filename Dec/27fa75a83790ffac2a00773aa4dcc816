The family of the slain sangoma, Anele Hoyana, has described the nature of the relationship between him and small scale farmer, Fritz Joubert as one that was friendly. Hoyana’s brother, Olwethu says his brother was helping Fritz with game farming. “They had been working together on that, and they had been very friendly, so we never would have expected something like this to occur.” “The only evidence that we have is the videos that are circulating where Fritz was very incoherent and rambling on and threatening Anele.” Hoyana was bludgeoned to death, allegedly by Joubert in Gonubie, in the Eastern Cape. Videos of the incident in which Joubert is seen holding a rifle and ordering Hoyana to kneel before him, while calling him the devil are being circulated on social media. Joubert later died in a confrontation with police. Olwethu Hoyana says: “I think the person who would know exactly what happened that day, as she had been there throughout the ordeal, would be Anele’s fiancé.” Meanwhile Eastern Cape police have appointed an investigator to probe Hoyana’s death. While details remain sketchy, police say they’re investigating what exactly happened. While this has brought a debate on racial issues around the country, on the farm, the family is preparing for his burial. For the latest on this watch below
