Scores of stakeholders will on Tuesday attend a summit in Graaff-Reinet to seek solutions to the water crisis that many regions are facing in the Eastern Cape. The South African Weather Service’s data for the spring season shows a recording of low rainfalls in the province, and high temperatures – with Graaff-Reinet being one of the hardest-hit towns. This as supply dams of a number of towns including Graaff-Reinet and Butterworth run dry. The aim is to develop a long and short-term water strategy for the drought-prone areas. Two of the residents say they are desperate… “A few months ago the municipality was here to drill boreholes but it hasn’t helped. The water that comes from there is dirty and is making us sick. Half the time most of us are at the clinics because of the water that we drink here. The municipality has to come out with another solution, This one isn’t working.” “I don’t know how they think people can survive without water. We sometimes have to go to work stinking because we couldn’t bath because there is no water. We can’t carry on like this. This isn’t fair.” Click on the video below:
