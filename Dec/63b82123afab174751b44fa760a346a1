The Cape Town Magistrateâ€™s Court has granted former media executive Willem Breytenbach bail of R 50 000. The court has also refused applications from media houses in the country to film proceedings in the case. It has, however, allowed journalists to take his picture in court before proceedings eventually commence. Breytenbach is facing charges of sexual and indecent assault. He was arrested in the Western Cape on Tuesday. Johannesburg-based copywriter, Deon Wiggett, has accused him of sexually abusing him more than 20 years ago.
