Suspected terrorist, Riana Heymans of the National Christian Resistance Movement, along with two people who are believed to have been harbouring her, will appear in the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. They were arrested by the Hawks over the weekend. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the group is believed to have been planning attacks on national keypoints, shopping malls and informal settlements across the country. He says they have confiscated firearms and ammunition, documents and other items for further investigation. The group’s self-professed leader, Harry Knoesen, was also arrested on terrorism charges last week. The three suspects will appear alongside Knoesen.
