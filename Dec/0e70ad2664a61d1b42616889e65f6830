Police Minister Bheki Cele will visit KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday as part of the police’s Safer Festive Season campaign. Under the theme, Zizojika Izinto, police officers have been deployed across the country to tackle crime head on during this busy period. Cele will this Christmas Eve inspect police-led operations in public spaces, such as beaches and taxi ranks. At the weekend, over 80 people were arrested for drunken driving and other related crimes at Durban’s beaches. Cele visited the Eastern Cape on Monday, where he applauded police’s crime fighting efforts. The Minister, however, raised concern over incidents of domestic violence in that province. On Sunday he had urged police officers in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, to use force against criminals and protect their own lives. At least 61 arrests have been made so far nationwide with offences ranging from robbery to rape. Click below to watch related videos:
