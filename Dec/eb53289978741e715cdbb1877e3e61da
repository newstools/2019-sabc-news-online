The Limpopo Transport department will intensify road safety campaigns during the festive season. MEC Dickson Masemola says law enforcement officers will be deployed across all major routes across the province. Police officers will also be deployed in anti-crime operations, as the festive season unfolds. During the first week of December traffic authorities launched a road safety campaign on the N1 near Polokwane. Motorists whose vehicles and credentials were checked were pleased with police visibility. “I feel good because here on the road there is many people who are driving without licenses, without the papers of the cars and carrying overloaded people. I appreciate the way they are controlling everything, we are safe,” says one motorist. The province is expected to see an increase in traffic volumes from this coming weekend. Deputy Police Commissioner, Jan Scheepers says there will be more anti-crime operations. “The main aim of this road block is to first prevent crime, but also to make sure that the users of our roads are safe. We look at the safety of our drivers and vehicles. We make sure everyone is adhering to the rules of the road, the rules of the country and also to make sure that everybody traveling here is safe,” says Scheepers. MEC Masemola says law enforcement officers will be deployed across all major routes. “Throughout the province today and going forward we are busy trough lawn enforcement through the roads of the province conducting road blocks, doing stop and search as an extra-ordinary measure to make sure that these festive season we do not leave things unturned. Last year in the province 163 people died by the end of December out of 335 accidents. We do not want to see those numbers going forward,” adds MEC Masemola.
