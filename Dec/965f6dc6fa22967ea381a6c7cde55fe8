Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer has apologised to South Africans for the embarrassment of having to implement Stage 6 load shedding. Eskom implemented Stage 6 on Monday, the first time ever that the system reached such a critical level. On Thursday Stage 2 load shedding will resume from 09:00 until 23:00 on Thursday night. Oberholzer was speaking at a media briefing at Megawatt Park in Johannesburg, that was also attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said the power utility had agreed with contractors that the aim now was to fix the problem – and stop the blaming. He says everyone at Eskom is taking accountability.    Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) NEC says it’s deeply concerned about the social and economic impact of the resumption of load shedding by Eskom. The party’s Secretary General Ace Magashule briefed the media on the outcome of the two day meeting held in Benoni, East of Johannesburg. Magashule says the NEC discussed challenges facing State Owned Enterprises, particularly SAA and Eskom. “Firm action is required to improve the governance and performance of SOE’s by ensuring the appointment of skilled staff and qualified board members, and protecting public institutions from improper interference.” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be no leave for key Eskom staff members until January to ensure that South Africans have no load shedding on Christmas day. Ramaphosa says Eskom’s board has promised to stabilise the national grid to avoid more load shedding during the festive season. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
