Eskom says its systems are still highly constrained. The power utility says Stage 2 load-shedding will continue until  23:00 on Monday night due to a shortage in the power generation capacity. Eskom says City Power in Johannesburg has warned that the power surges due to load-shedding are causing extensive damage to its infrastructure following an explosion at one of its sub-stations over the weekend. A number of areas in the north of Johannesburg were left without electricity. Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae has urged customers to continue using electricity sparingly. “As you leave home this morning,  please switch off your appliances, and when you leave work this afternoon please switch off all equipment that won’t be used overnight, like computers, printers and copiers.” Click on the video below:
