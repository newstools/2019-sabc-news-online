Independent Business Rescue Practitioner, Les Matuson, says he will be calling a general meeting of all South African Airways (SAA) stakeholders within 10 days. The airline has been placed under business rescue, with Matuson appointed as the Business Rescue Practitioner this week. SAA has also been granted a R4 billion lifeline from the government and banks to launch the rescue plan. In a statement sent to the media, Matuson says they are working with industry bodies to ensure that customers can book their SAA flights with confidence. Matuson says his team will immediately begin consultations with all affected stakeholders. In the meantime, he says employees have been requested to continue with their normal work duties as the airline is fully operational. He says one of the key objectives of business rescue is to preserve jobs and ensure that the business is sustainable. Watch a related video below:
