The National Defence Force has reiterated that the weapons which were stolen from its army base in Lyttelton in Pretoria have not been recovered.  National Defence Force Union Secretary Pikkie Greeff on Friday said the 19 R-4 rifles were found in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria but later told SABC News that only parts of the weapons had been recovered. SANDF spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini says: “Did he take you to where the weapons were found? Did he tell you these are the weapons they have found? As far as we are concerned, our investigation is going on and we have no weapons that we can say to you, these are the weapons, this is what we have found. Our major concentration now is to find those weapons and bring them back to where they belong. We are really concerned about them being in the wrong hands.” Twelve SANDF members were denied bail in the Millitary Court in Thaba Tshwane last night after they were charged with three counts including housebreaking, theft and loss of firearms in connection with the theft. Eleven were arrested on Monday, and another on Friday morning.
