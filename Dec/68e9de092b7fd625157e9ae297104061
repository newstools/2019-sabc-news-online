The Tau Lekoa Gold Mine management says the fifth mine worker who was rescued on Friday following a rockfall that killed four miners is in a stable condition in hospital. Three rock drillers and a team leader died at the mine shaft in Orkney near Klerksdorp due to a rockfall. Their bodies were recovered last night, after long efforts by the rescue teams. Rock drillers, Xolani Meva from Elliotdale, Lungile Nyawose from Lusikisiki, Karabo Mabuthile from Fochvillea and a team leader Katleho Nthibane from Bloemfontein lost their lives. The victims were trapped by a rockfall about 1350 metres below the surface of the mine shaft in Orkney near Klerksdorp. This follows two seismic events. The National Union of Mine Workers (NUM) says an independent forensic investigation should be conducted at the mine, as this is not the first incident to take lives.
