A number of people have been injured in a multiple vehicle pile-up on the M19 near Pinetown west of Durban. Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson is urging motorists to use alternative routes as traffic has been severely affected. “At this stage it is reported that four or five vehicles have collided with one vehicle down the embankment. Multiple casualties have been reported, and paramedics are currently treating them on the scene before being transported to various hospitals for further care they may require…” “Traffic is severely affected on both bounds of the M19 going towards Pinetown and out. We advise motorists to avoid this road at all costs,” adds Jamieson. Heavy rains continued overnight across the province, reducing visibility on the roads.
