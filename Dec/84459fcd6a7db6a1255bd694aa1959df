As thousands of holidaymakers make their way to various holiday destinations for the festive season, motorists have been warned to be vigilant on the roads. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department says it has begun to experience heavy traffic leaving the city using the N3 and the N1 north highways. JMPD Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar has urged motorists to exercise caution while driving and to rest when taking long distance trips. “Traffic is slowly starting to pick up in many of the major routes, particularly the N3 going towards KwaZulu-Natal and the N1 towards Limpopo. Motorists should do a pre-trip inspection before embarking on a long trip. And drivers should drive within the speed limit. They should not overtake when it is not safe. This behaviour causes accidents,” says Minnaar. Traffic is also increasing on the N4 towards the Lowveld in Mpumalanga. “We are definitely seeing increase on the volume of traffic going to the Middelburg Plaza as we speak, we expecting traffic to increasing more as people are heading towards the Lowveld and Mozambique on holiday,” says Trans African Concession (TRAC) Spokesperson Solange Soares-Nicholson. At least 86 drunken drivers have been arrested so far in Johannesburg since the city launched its 2019 festive season safety operation over a week ago. The operation was launched by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. The Minister has warned that lawlessness will not be tolerated on South African roads. Watch related video below:
