Close to 500 motorists have been arrested for drinking and driving in Johannesburg so far this festive season. The arrests come as the Johannesburg Metro Police intensified operations across the City to combat drunken driving. 29 fatal crashes were also recorded in Johannesburg since the start of December. JMPD spokesperson Xolani Fihla says 469 motorists have been arrested in relation to driving under the influence. “From the first weekend of December 469 motorists have been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol by JMPD officers. Drinking and driving remain a serious problem. So JMPD has intensified operations concerning this issue leading up to the new year and beyond. 29 fatal accidents have been reported since the beginning of December and five of these occurred on the refurbished m2 bridge in the Johannesburg CBD,” says Fihla.
