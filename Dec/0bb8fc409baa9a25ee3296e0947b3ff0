Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Velenkosi Hlabisa says their decision to support the African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg was about ensuring service delivery. The IFP helped the ANC to regain control of the City of Johannesburg. ANC candidate Geoff Makhubu was elected its new Mayor. Hlabisa says the IFP is committed to improving the lives of Johannesburg residents. “The IFP is more concerned on service delivery. We are not concerned as to who is in charge and we are not interested in seeing the City of Johannesburg, which is in charge of the majority of people in our country, at a standstill. So now the decision of political parties to agree to make progress is what we appreciate and we are looking forward to see this working relationship not serving the political parties but the people of Johannesburg,” says Hlabisa. Hlabisa was speaking to the SABC News during the party’s Mpumalanga leg of its ‘face to face’ your of the country. The IFP has already visited two provinces, Gauteng and Limpopo.
