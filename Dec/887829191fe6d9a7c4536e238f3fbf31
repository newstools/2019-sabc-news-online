A bleak Christmas season faces some Eastern Cape towns. Residents of towns falling under the Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality could find themselves in the dark as a result of outstanding debts with Eskom and could be without power for up to 14 hours a day. Bulk power interruption was announced by Eskom over the non-payment of outstanding debt by the municipality. The announcement came after the municipality failed to provide the power utility with an acceptable payment arrangement of the municipalityâ€™s bulk electricity debt. The towns affected include Fort Beaufort, Adelaide and Bedford. The area is also in the grip of a crippling drought; further compounding the challenges being faced by residents.
