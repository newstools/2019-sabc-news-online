Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula says the process of appointing permanent members of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board is at an advanced stage. He was speaking during a question and answer session in the National Assembly by ministers in the Economic Cluster. Mbalula says, “We are in the process to finalise a permanent board to restore stability, at advanced stage. We will subject prospective board members to interview process. We have begun a robust consequence management system where we hold the board accountable for delivery for targets agreed to.” Parliament’s standing committee on public accounts sent Prasa’s board packing after it failed to answer crucial questions on 2018/2019 financial statements. Last month, the minister said Prasa will have a group CEO by the end of February next year. He says, “I wish to ensure the committee that processes are underway to finalise the appointment of a full time Group CEO by the end of the current financial year. Progress has been made with the appointment of executives, with the appointment of a Chief Financial Officer, a Chief Procurement Officer and a Group Executive for Human Capital Management on the 1st of September 2019. All the newly appointed executives are all women – an affirmation to our commitment to women empowerment and recognition of women excellence.” Additional reporting by Mercedes Besent.
