Public Service and Administration Minister, Senzo Mchunu, has announced amendments to the ministerial handbook in Pretoria. The aim is to curb state expenditure which has been identified as spiraling out of control. Newly-appointed ministers will no longer get security upgrades at state or private homes. Government also intends to introduce one house each for ministers and deputy ministers as compared to the current system of two. Ministers and their deputies have state houses in Pretoria and Cape Town, which is costly to the state. Mchunu announces further cuts: “The first one is that the benefits in relation to vehicles for ministers, for MECs, for mayors that are bought by the state are now parked at R700 000. Ministers, deputy ministers, mayors EXCOs, MECs,  and premiers will no longer are allowed to fly business class. We now have to fly economy.”
