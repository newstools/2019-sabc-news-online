Political analyst Dirk Kotze says the new Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo has a huge job of trying to convince residents of the city that he is the right man to take over from the DA’s Herman Mashaba. Kotze cited Makhubo’s links with the controversial Gupta family and his previous role as member of mayoral committee for Finance as factors that could come back to haunt him. Makhubo, who represents the African National Congress (ANC),attained 137 of the 268 votes beating the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) candidates by a significant margin. Kotze says some serious questions need to be answered about Makhubo’s election. He says, “Well there are certainly a lot of discussion about him and his background as a business person before he joined the council. The links of his company to Regiment, that was very much linked to the Gupta family, and he was the MMC for finance when the ANC was in power and this will obviously aggravate the situation more because it means he was at the heart of the financial management of the council. “From that point of view there is certainly some serious questions that are still hanging over his head,” added Kotze.
