The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), one of the main opposition party’s in Botswana says it has proof that the recent general elections were rigged. UDC’s leader Duma Boko says he is adamant that he has proof that the general elections that were held on October 23, 2019 were rigged. Boko told the media in Johannesburg that he intends to challenge the election results in court because rigging was evident. He says, “There was rigging right across the country, it differed only in scale. In certain instances, there seemed to have been a pattern which was to target certain constituencies, mainly in the southern part of the country, so even though there was rigging in other constituencies it was not as massive as what took place in the other areas and so in the constituencies where we won, we won inspire of the rigging.” The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) which has been in power since the country won independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 rebounded from its worst-ever electoral performance in 2014 to win this year’s elections. BDP won 38 out of the 57 seats of the national assembly, despite infighting within its ranks.
