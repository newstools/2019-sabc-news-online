An international fisheries stock assessment review workshop has kicked off at the University of Cape Town on Monday. Fishing industry role players, including local scientists, international experts and representatives from government are discussing the state of South Africa’s major renewable marine resources. This year’s workshop will focus primarily on the extent to which hake, the mainstay of the South African fishing industry, may extend into Namibian waters. This is a matter which has important management and financial implications for the South African sector. Other issues which will be discussed include how best to calculate sustainable catch levels for the local sardine and west coast rock lobster resources; as well as how to determine whether fishing of sardine and anchovy in the vicinity of Robben and Dassen Islands is having a negative impact on the endangered penguin species in those areas.
