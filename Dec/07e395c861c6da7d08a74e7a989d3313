A 16-year-old learner from George, in the Southern Cape, has been raped and killed, allegedly by one of her family members. Allishandre Floors, who attended George High School, went missing from her family home in Stormsriver, Tsitsikamma, on the 22nd of December. George High School sent their deepest sympathies to the family of the murdered Floors. Principal Morton van Rooyen wrote on Facebook in a post that included Floors’ photo: “George High grieves the tragic passing of one of our learners. Our deepest condolences to the family – may her soul rest in peace”. She was last seen with a 41-year-old man. The suspect confessed the crime to police on Friday and also pointed out where he had hidden the body. He is expected to appear in court soon.
