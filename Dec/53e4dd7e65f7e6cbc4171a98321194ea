Deputy President David Mabuza says government is committed to fight the scourge of HIV and AIDS. He says more outreach programmes need to be conducted to educate people about the disease. Mabuza gave the main speech at the World Aids Day commemoration event at the James Motlatsi Stadium in Orkney in North West. “We are not happy about the infections, more advocacy, more outreach programme from our side talking to our specially young girls who are getting infected. We less understand the situation. This disease is more less related to poverty. Young girls are getting infected because of their situation. So we are going to step up our efforts.”       DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6563063-Speech-DEPUTY-PRESIDENT-DAVID-MABUZA.js", {
