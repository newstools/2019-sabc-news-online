The government of eSwatini has denied claims that King Mswati the third has ordered the arrest of four citizens on allegations of treason. In a statement, the government says the claims, which were reported in South African media articles are intended to paint a bad image of the King and country. The Swaziland Solidarity Network in South Africa earlier this week tweeted that the King had ordered the arrest of Prophet Gcina Mthethwa, Sibahle Nkambule, and journalists Musa Ndlangamandla and Zweli Dlamini. Prophet Mtsetfwa has reportedly fled to South Africa. eSwatini Government Spokesperson, Sabelo Dlamini says the reports are misleading. Dlamini says, “The press release was prompted by reports insinuating that the King has issued a decree to arrest the four on a treason charge. That is not true and very misleading. There is no basis or fact. The King does not issue orders of arrest,  that is the prerogative of the police. They have issued no order of arrest, no warrant of arrest for any of the four. So these are totally misleading reports.”
