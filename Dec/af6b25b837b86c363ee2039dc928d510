Government says it is satisfied with how the SABC is spending the R2.1 billion it transferred to the public broadcaster. In October this year, government transferred part of the expected R3.2 billion cash injection into the public broadcaster. Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says they will meet with SABC authorities early in the new year to discuss the release of the remaining R1.1 billion. She says they are monitoring how the SABC is spending the money in order to give government monthly reports. “We are confident that the SABC will come back to us and say we no longer require government funding because when we approved the turnaround strategy, it was a good plan that did not only give us insight to what is happening today, but the kind of the future broadcaster that we must envisage for the SABC, which is why as government and Parliament we will be doing our everything to support where we are supposed to play our role,” says Ndabeni-Abrahams.
