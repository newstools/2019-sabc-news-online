Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the arrest of two alleged train arsonists. The two suspects are alleged to have set alight 18 train carriages in Cape Town in November. The suspects, aged 14 and 15, were caught after one of them was recognised in an identikit released by Metrorail. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) offered a R100 000 reward to anyone with information that could lead to a successful conviction. Mbalula has lamented the age of the suspects. The suspects appeared briefly in court this week and are expected back in court on 9 January 2020. They remain in juvenile custody. Investigations continue on the motive of the attack, with the possibility that the teenagers were acting on the instruction of adults with malicious intent. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
