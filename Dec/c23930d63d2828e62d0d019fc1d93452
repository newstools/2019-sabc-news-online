Over 50 000 workers at the country’s major State-Owned Entities (SOEs) will down tools against privatisation at the beginning of next year. The National Union of Metal Workers (Numsa), National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and their affiliated unions are among those who will strike. Numsa president, Andrew Chirwa, made the announcement at their central executive meeting at Newtown in Johannesburg. “This is beyond Eskom and when we mobilise we are working with NUM. We are engaging together as we all have an interest in saving Eskom as one of the State-Owned Enterprises. In the process of section 77 which we are applying for all SOEs together with SAFTU to defend all SOEs, that will be massive. You are talking about all workers in SAA, we are talking about workers in Eskom, on the street alone we are talking about over 50 000 workers.” Watch related video below:
