The 23-year-old man who allegedly gunned down his former girlfriend at a Mangosuthu University of Technology residence last year is expected to take the stand in the Durban High Court on Monday. It is alleged that Thabani Mzolo shot and killed his former girlfriend Zolile Khumalo last year. The court heard that Mzolo forced his way into the student residence, barged into Khumaloâ€™s room and shot her. The State has since closed its case. Mzolo is expected to take the stand as the first witness for the defence.
