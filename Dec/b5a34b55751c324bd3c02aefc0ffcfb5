National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Chairperson Amos Masondo say they are deeply saddened by the passing on of former MP and anti-apartheid activist Ben Turok. The former Joint Ethics and Members Interests Committee co-chairperson died in his sleep at his home in the early hours of Monday morning. In a statement, the Presiding officers of Parliament describe Turok as a revered struggle hero who mobilised South Africans of all races around the Freedom Charter. Modise and Masondo say Turok was amongst the sharpest political minds, especially in the area of political economy. They say he co-drafted the economics section of the 1955 Freedom Charter alongside Billy Nair. Both were arrested and charged with treason with 156 other Congress activists in 1956. The late 92 year old was born in Lavia on the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe in 1927. He arrived in South Africa with his parents in 1934 at the age of seven. Turok met his wife Marry Butcher in Cape Town around 1952. They have three sons, Fred, Ivan and Neil. Parliament has sentÂ  heartfelt condolences to the Turok family, friends, his African National Congress (ANC) comrades and to all those who were touched by his life. Watch related videos:
