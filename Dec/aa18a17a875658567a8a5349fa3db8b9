Police are investigating a murder case after three people were killed in a fire at Edlebe near Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the deceased are a couple in their 60s and an 11-year-old boy. The authorities were alerted when people saw their house was on fire. The bodies were burnt beyond recognition. Mbhele says the motive for the killing is unknown at this stage. “Police were called to the scene by the neighbour after they found or noticed that the house was burning and when they arrive they found the three people in the house. They were burnt beyond recognition and there is a case of murder that is being investigated but police are still at the scene.”
