Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu continues to receive treatment in a Cape Town hospital for a recurring infection. The 88-year-old clergyman was hospitalised earlier this week. Chairperson of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, Niclas Kjellstrom-Matseke, says they hope the cleric will be discharged early next week. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and has received treatment in the past for a similar condition. Tutu was last seen in public welcoming the Springboks to Cape Town during their trophy parade in the CBD. His family has thanked all those whoâ€™ve sent well wishes and prayers. Watch video below:
