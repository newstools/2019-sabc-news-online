Two municipalities in the Northern Cape and two in Namibia have signed twinning agreements they hope will improve service delivery in their respective towns. The Northern Cape’s Namakwa District Municipality and Richtersveld Municipality have signed agreements with Nambia’s Luderitz and Oranjemund municipalities. They want to promote tourism, service delivery, skills development and education. Mayor of Namakwa District Municipality, Marvin Cloete says they will be focusing more on cultural issues. “We will help one another. For us, as the Namakwa District, it is important that we focus on cultural issues. So, it will be sharing different ideas and best models.” “We have different areas in which we want to improve like the tourism industry and capacity building of our staff, skills development, and our education sector. We are aware that SA is far advanced and  ahead of Namibia, so that’s where we want to tap from the Northern Cape,” says Deputy Mayor of Namibia’s Luderitz Municipality, Brigitte Fredericks.
