An explosion at the Brynorth substation has left a number of areas in the North of Johannesburg without power. City Power says a feeder-board exploded causing extensive damage at the substation. Areas affected include Bryanston, River Club, Morningside, Douglasdale and surrounding areas. City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena says they do not know how long it will take to restore power in the area. “We don’t know what caused the explosion but we have an investigation team on site currently assessing the damage. The explosion affected power supply to areas including the whole of Bryanston. Traffic lights are also affected, we don’t have ETR yet we can only give that after technicians have estimated the extent of damage and how long it will take to restore power in the area.” The explosion happened on the Eskom side of the network, it said, adding that operators were currently on site. “Our technicians are currently on site and ETR will only be given after technicians have determined the extent of the damage,” the power utility tweeted.
