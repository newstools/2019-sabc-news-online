Chaos has erupted in the Tshwane Council special meeting for a motion of no confidence in the Mayor and the Speaker. The Speaker of the Tshwane Council, Katlego Mathebe recused herself before the special council meeting started under loud protest from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) saying they want to speak directly to her when bringing the motion of no confidence in her. EFF council members tried to prevent her from leaving. Her deputy, Sweli Khumalo, took her place. The EFF however forcefully removed the chair from under him and he left the podium. Last week, the Speaker disallowed a previous motion of no-confidence from the EFF in Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. The meeting is yet to start. Watch related video below:
