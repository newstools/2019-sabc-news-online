The National Assembly is on Wednesday morning expected to consider the Justice and Correctional Services Committee report which recommends that Kholeka Gcaleka be appointed the deputy public protector. This comes as the term of office of outgoing Deputy Public Protector Advocate Kevin Malunga comes to an end on Monday December 9, 2019. Wednesday will also be the last National Assembly sitting before MPs get set for their December recess. Gcaleka was the legal advisor of former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. She was one of the seven candidates who were shortlisted for the position of Deputy Public Protector. Last week, the committee recommended her as the best person for the job. However, the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) were not in support of Gcaleka to be recommended as the best candidate for the position. During interviews, opposition parties questioned Gcaleka and why she remained as advisor to Gigaba, after a court found that Gigaba had lied under oath. The committee will now seek the final approval of the National Assembly on Wednesday morning recommending that President Cyril Ramaphosa should appoint her to the position.
