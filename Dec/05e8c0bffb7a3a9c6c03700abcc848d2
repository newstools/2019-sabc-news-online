South African photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed is said to have escaped from captivity in Syria. According to a Gift of the Givers statement, Mohamed was assisted by people who knew about his kidnapping and is now with Turkish authorities. “We have informed Shiraaz’s family, Minister Naledi Pandor and Consular Services at Dirco. All have acknowledged our messages. We now wait for the South African government to make contact with Turkish intelligence to bring Shiraaz home as soon as practically possible,” says the humanitarian group, which has been pushing for Mohamed’s freedom. The photojournalist was taken hostage on 10 January 2017 in Darkoush after being accused of being a foreign spy. His family has released a statement, saying it will comment on the matter once it has received independent confirmation of Mohamed’s safety.
