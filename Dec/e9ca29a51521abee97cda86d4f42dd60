The Gauteng Department of Health has advised parents who send their children to initiation schools to ensure that the school they choose is registered. On Tuesday, a 23-year-old man died at an illegal initiation school at Crown Mines in Johannesburg. This was the second death at an illegal initiation school in the province this week. In the Eastern Cape, more than 20 initiates died during the summer initiation season, most of them from dehydration. Gauteng Department of Health Spokesperson Kwara Kekana says: “The Gauteng Department of Health is urging communities and the public, in particular, to be alert and be vigilant with regards to taking the young men to bogus initiation schools. The Department is available and ready to work with communities that seek circumcision services in Gauteng.” Watch the video below for related news:
