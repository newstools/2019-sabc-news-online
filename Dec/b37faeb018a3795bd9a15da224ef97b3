A systemic tremor at the Orkney mine, Tau Lefa, near Klerksdorp in North West has left five people trapped underground. National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) President Joseph Montisetsi says safety measures could have been put in place by management. He says nothing has happened so far even though miners were trapped in similar circumstances in 2017. Montisetsi says this puts the lives of their members at risk as the place is unsafe for employment. “Five workers were trapped in a rail cart when they were doing their daily duty and according to explanation, this mine is mining pillars which are holding the upper cable of the rocks. There is a long surface which is not holding on anything that left five workers trapped,” says Montisetsi.
