National Union of Mine Workers (NUM) has raised questions over why miners aren’t evacuated prior to seismic events. This after three rock drillers and a team leader died at the mine shaft in Orkney near Klerksdorp due to a rockfall. The victims were trapped about 1 350 metres below the surface of the mine shaft. Rock drillers Xolani Meva from Elliotdale, Lungile Nyawose from Lusikisiki, Karabo Mabuthile from Fochvillea and team leader Katleho Nthibane from Bloemfontein lost their lives. Their bodies were recovered Saturday night by the rescue teams. NUM’s President, Joseph Montisetse says there is a technological thing that is able to predict seismic events. He says: “Why can’t they be told they need to be evacuated from the place because there will be a seismic event.” “It is because it is a business, people are making money and therefore we cannot disturb their business.” Montisetse also says an independent forensic investigation should be conducted at the mine He says: “The government must establish a forensic audit over this matter, including everything. We also need a report of 2017 with the recommendations from DMR – we want to check whether management has implemented the recommendations.” Watch video below for the latest
