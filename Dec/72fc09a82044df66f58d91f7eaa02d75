The City of Cape Town, says 24 people have died in shack fires in the metro since the start of the festive season. It has assisted over 500 fire victims with housing kits to rebuild their structures. Mayoral Committee Member for Human Settlements, Malusi Booi, visited families in Masiphumelele in Fish Hoek where two people died in a fire on Christmas Day. They were among five people who died in three separate fires in  the Metro on Wednesday. Booi says the tragedy in Masiphumelele could have been prevented if people relocated to a nearby housing development . “Out of what we are putting in we don’t see much improvement because as you can see in nearby area we have built good houses and these people are supposed to be in houses most of them. What I assume has happened is that people have left others in those units,” say Booi.
