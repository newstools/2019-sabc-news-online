The Land Party has called for an urgent investigation into the competency of the Law Enforcement officials in the Overstrand Municipality. This follows the death of a 32-year-old law enforcement official on Boxing Day. Damian Coert was on patrol with his partner in the Hermanus area when his colleague’s firearm accidentally discharged. According to the municipality, it was a freak incident. Land Party leader, Gcobani Ndzongana, says the gun should not have been out of its holster. “Every six months, police officials and every other human being using a firearm must undergo a competency test. When was the last time the gentleman and his colleague that shot him went to that training? We want to see the competency test certificate. It might happen that these law enforcement officials do not have the competency certificate.” The Overstrand Municipality says the law enforcement official whose gun discharged has appeared in the Hermanus Magistrate’s Court. The municipality says at this stage the official’s court appearance was standard procedure and he is yet to be charged. Municipal Manager, Coenie Groenewald, says all personnel involved are receiving trauma counselling. The official will appear in court again on the 31 March 2020.
