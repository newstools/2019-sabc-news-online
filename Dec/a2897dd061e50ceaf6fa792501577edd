Police in KwaZulu-Natal are still looking for those responsible for Saturday’s shooting in Umhlanga Rocks Drive, north of Durban in which two people died. A man and woman in their early thirties were found in their bullet-ridden car after being shot at during an apparent high speed chase. The woman died on the scene and the man later succumbed to his injuries in hospital. Police Spokesperson, Jay Naicker, says a double murder is being investigated. “It’s alleged that two vehicles were seen travelling at a high speed on Umhlanga Rocks Drive in La Lucia Ridge. According to witnesses, the occupants of one vehicle opened fire at the other vehicle. A woman believed to be in her 30s sustained gunshot wounds and was declared dead at the scene. A man from the vehicle was taken to hospital for medical attention, where we were informed that he later passed away. The motive for the attack is yet to be established as investigations are ongoing, says Naicker.
