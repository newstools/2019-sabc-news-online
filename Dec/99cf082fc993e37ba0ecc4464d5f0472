South African musician Yvonne Chaka Chaka has been deported from Uganda. There were conflicting reports about whether she had indeed been deported. However, Ugandan authorities have now confirmed that she’s been sent back to South Africa. Chaka Chaka was in the country to perform in a concert to usher in the New Year. A spokesperson for the Ugandan Police, Fred Enanga, says she came on an ordinary visa instead of a working visa. Ugandan police spokesperson, Fred Enanga says, “Now this was essentially by our officials to help maintain the integrity of our immigration rules for all visitors to our country, including foreign musicians. We are hopeful that in the future Ms Mhinga Yvonne known as Chaka Chaka will once again visit our country Uganda when she applies for the right visa.”
