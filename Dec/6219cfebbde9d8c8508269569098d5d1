Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Barbara Creecy has ordered the suspension of all officials involved in an incident in which top cyclist Nic Dlamini had his arm broken allegedly by park rangers in Cape Town. This after the 24-year-old cyclist allegedly resisted arrest at the Silvermine Section of the Table Mountain National Park. Meanwhile, South African National Parks (SANParks) says it will institute an independent investigation into the matter with immediate effect. SANParks says the cyclist had entered the park without paying or showing a permit when requested. Spokesperson Rey Tlakuli says no one is above the law. A fellow cyclist Donovan Le Cok who posted the video of the scuffle between Dlamini and the Table Mountain National Park rangers claims Dlamini was never aggressive nor resisted the rangers. He says an altercation broke out when a group of about six rangers allegedly grabbed the handlebars of Dlaminiâ€™s bicycle, causing him to crash. Le Cok says there was a heated discussion between Dlamini and the rangers as he was upset that he had been knocked off his bicycle.
