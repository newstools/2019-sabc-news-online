Several places have been made available to shelter victims of Monday’s floods in Pretoria. The Rethabile, Stanza Bopape, and Ikageng Halls in Mamelodi east of Pretoria are accommodating the displaced people. Hundreds of shacks were swept away when the Moretele River burst its banks leaving more than a thousand shack dwellers homeless. Secretary-General of the NotInMyName-movement, Themba Maseko, has called on all South Africans to donate food, clothing, blankets and relief materials to the people who lost everything. “It’s people that are struggling in life. We had reports that hundreds of shacks were swept away and flooded inside, and people lost the little belongings that they had, and it really affected them. Imagine you don’t have bed this morning, imagine not having clothes, children not having milk, and almost a 1 000 people have been affected in the country thus far.” Click on the video below:
