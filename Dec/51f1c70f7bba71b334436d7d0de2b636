Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane has conceded that massive amounts of litter in uMthatha in the Eastern Cape might be linked to instability in the municipality and has impacted on service delivery. Mabuyane together with KSD mayor Nyaniso Nelani launched a Clean Up Campaign aimed at keeping the city clean. Premier Mabuyane called on businesses and communities to take part in turning things around. “It always talks to the functionality of the municipality. Municipalities are there to ensure that they actually deliver basic services to our people. We’ve seen problems of municipalities which are not focused, instabilities caused by a lot of issue, sometimes political issues, micro-management, interference,” says Mabuyane. “We’ve said as the governing party allow managers to manage. We are appealing to everyone. We are mobilising the communities. People must take part in cleaning their towns, in cleaning their areas. We are not just looking for uMthatha but also the townships around here, where our people stay. Let’s keep them clean,” adds Mabuyane.
