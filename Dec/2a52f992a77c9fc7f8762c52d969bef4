Minister of Police Bheki Cele says the police must push back strongly against crime. Cele was speaking at the funeral of police officer Teena Pillay who was gunned down on his way to work at the weekend. The officer shot and killed one of the suspects on the scene. Speaking at Pillay’s funeral in Mount Edgecombe north of Durban, Cele is called on the community to work with police. “It looks like criminals, they attack the police and indeed criminality cannot co-exist with policing. Hence now and again we make a call upon the South African police to say they must not die with their guns, they must be vigilant they must be alert. They must cover one another. They must be together and make sure that they push back the criminality.” Cele says Pillay was a tough officer who died with integrity.  Hundreds turned out to bid farewell to the fallen officer. Meanwhile, the festive season safety campaign is in full swing. Cele has been criss-crossing the country engaging citizens about their safety concerns. He paid a visit to the community of Greytown in KwaZulu-Natal. Cele said it is worrying that some people continue to be found on the wrong side of the law. “We find unnecessary things like in Umlazi, we found some unlicensed firearms. So those things could have caused danger and accidents if they were not found by police,” says Cele. Residents say they feel safe. Click below for more on the story:
