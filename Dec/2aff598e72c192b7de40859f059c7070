The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says although convicted racist Vicki Momberg has been released from prison, racism cannot be tolerated. Momberg was released late on Friday afternoon following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s remission of sentence earlier this month. She had served her time at the Sun City Correctional facility, south of Johannesburg since November this year. The former real estate agent landed herself behind bars after hurling racial insults and the k-word more than 40 times against police officers after a smash-and-grab incident in 2016. Momberg was convicted on four counts of crimen injuria in the Randburg Magistrate’s court last year. SAHRC CEO Tseliso Thipanyane says: We have to keep on fighting issues of racism and I guess in this particular case, Miss Momberg served her time and she has been released on early release like many other prisoners and there is nothing we can do about that. However, one hopes that you know that this should not be seen as an excuse for people to continue going against the principles of our Constitution and using k-words and other racist remarks.”
