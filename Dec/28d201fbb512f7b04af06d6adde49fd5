Gauteng police say they are on high alert and will be monitoring New Year’s Eve celebrations across the province to ensure the safety of the public as they welcome in the New Year. A number of celebrations will be held across Gauteng as people usher in the New Year and the public is warned that police will show no mercy to those caught driving while under the influence of alcohol. Gauteng police will also be patrolling the streets of Hillbrow, Johannesburg and Pretoria Central, Soweto and Mamelodi where revellers in these places have displayed unruly behaviour in the past. However, this has since changed in recent years where minimum incidents were reported due to high police visibility. “The public is urged to remain vigilant and aware of their immediate surroundings during the celebrations, as criminals are opportunistic and sometimes use crowds as cover to commit crime. Report any suspicious persons or activities by calling the Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or by sending a tip-off on the MySAPS app that can be downloaded onto any smartphone,” says Mathapelo Peters, Gauteng police Spokesperson.
