Some farmers in Mpumalanga say the recent rainfall in the province have brought them much needed relief. Mpumalanga is among the provinces that are seriously affected by the drought. Deputy President of Mpumalanga Agriculture, Coenie Dafel says although they are happy with the recent rain, more rainfall is needed as water levels remain low in the damns. “We had soft rain, really soft soaking rain for the last 2, 3 days and the average was between 40 and 50 ml. it made a big change in our area that the drought is now broken and we really expect that our bore holes will be recharged. We can see the field is growing very nicely and the animals are growing and crops are growing very very nicely and everything is fine.”
