The funeral service of 18-year-old Gomolemo Legae is under way in her home village of Seweding in Mahikeng in the North West. Legae was stabbed several times and her body was then burnt with petrol. She was found next to a local primary school in Ramosadi village just outside Mahikeng on Sunday morning. Police say Legae sustained multiple stab wounds and third degree burns. Legae’s body arrived at her home on Wednesday morning ahead of the funeral service. It is a traditional belief that when someone died brutally or in an accident, the body is brought home for funeral service in the morning. Legae was allegedly stabbed several times, and doused with petrol before being burnt, all this while she was still alive. The alleged perpetrator is a 19-year-old school boy who has since been arrested and expected to appear before Mmabatho Magistrate’s Court later on Wednesday. Police say allegations of rape are also being investigated. Click on the video below:
