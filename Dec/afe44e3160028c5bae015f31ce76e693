Tons of plastic waste appeared in waves along the Durban coastline on Thursday. A video captured and shared on social media by a member of The Litterboom Project, a South African conservation initiative, showed plastic bottles and other litter being churned out onto a Durban beach by the waves. According to The Litterboom Project this is an epidemic that is getting worse due to informal settlements popping up along rivers on top of poor service delivery from Durbanâ€™s municipality. During the dry season in South Africa in the winter this pollution is not as visible in the water but at the beginning of summer the first big rainfall washes it all out into the ocean and onto the beaches. It is a problem that campaigners say the government needs to get behind. They want a legislation put in place to reduce plastic production and infrastructure implemented to remove waste efficiently.
