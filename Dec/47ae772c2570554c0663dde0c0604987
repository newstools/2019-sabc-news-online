A Sudanese court sentenced 27 members of the national intelligence service to death on Monday over the killing of a teacher in detention in February during protests that led to the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir. The case marks the first in which courts have handed down convictions over crackdowns on demonstrations in the months before and after Bashir was toppled in April. The death of teacher Ahmed al-Khair in the eastern town of Khashm al-Qirba became a rallying point during 16 weeks of protests against Al Bashir’s rule. Al Khair’s family said security officials initially claimed he had died of poisoning but days later a state investigation found he had died of injuries from a beating.
