Young environmental activists will take centre stage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference – COP25 in Madrid, Spain on Monday. Greta Thunberg from Sweden and German’s Luisa Neubauer will host a press conference in the morning to share their views and expectations from this year’s negotiations on climate action. 2019 has been a big year for youth activism in the environmental space. In September, the United Nations hosted a Youth Climate Summit in New York where young people presented plans and projects to combat climate change. Scientists have warned that the climate crisis will affect the younger and future generations the most. Environmentalists even describe it as a child rights crisis. Experts are concerned that country plans on mitigation and the nationally determined contributions do not mention children or young people. A side event will also take place where a group of youth from different continents will share their concerns. An inter-governmental declaration on children, youth and climate action will be launched by UNICEF and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Declaration calls on member states to commit to accelerating inclusive child-responsive climate action
