The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is determined to become the official opposition in the Free State after leader Julius Malema raised concerns about how the party performed in several provinces. Malema voiced his concern at the party’s second National People’s Assembly at the weekend. EFF Free State leader Mandisa Makhesini says they will ensure that the party becomes the official opposition after the 2021 municipal elections. Makhesini says the party will work tirelessly to recruit new members. “We are going to go back to next year to come with a strategy to work ward to ward so that everyone can do the work. Whoever does not do the work regardless of their position, they will have to be excused so that we identify people with potential in the Free State who were not given opportunities to lead. We are going to work with everyone and will appreciate the criticism of the CIC and we want to say we will still work very hard and next year, come another five years when the report to the third and NPA Free State will be the official opposition,” says Makhesini.
