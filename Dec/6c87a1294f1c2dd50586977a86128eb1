KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says government is working towards creating jobs to help alleviate poverty and increase unity in South Africa. This as President Cyril Ramaphosa prepares to deliver the keynote address at the commemoration of the National Day of Reconciliation at Bergville in the KZN Midlands on Monday. The Day of Reconciliation has been commemorated since 1995 to promote reconciliation and unity. Zikalala says equality can be achieved through job creation. “Causal factors of inequality are unemployment and income distribution, and as government we need to work to create more employment. We have managed to create a situation where we mitigate poverty. But we must move to a point where we create jobs. Let’s get people employed and that is why as the government we introduced the minimum wage,” says Zikalala.  Watch the video below for more:
