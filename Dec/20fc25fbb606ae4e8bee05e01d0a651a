The Democratic Alliance (DA) has sent a stark warning to the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements, saying the City of Tshwane should not be placed under administration. This after Human Settlements MEC, Lebogang Maile, announced that among the reasons for placing the city under administration is the frequency of unauthorised and irregular expenditure, as per the Auditor General’s report, as well as the current financial crisis the city is faced with. Speaking during a media briefing in Bruma, Johannesburg, the DA’s Gauteng caucus leader, Solly Msimanga, says Tshwane does not yet meet the criteria to be placed under administration. “Lebogang Maile, we want to warn him. We are saying we are ready, our lawyers are ready and we want him to start the process of Section 139. We want to say that he is not going to succeed on this one. I think it is time that we hold people personally accountable and not use taxpayers’ money. The Section 139 is very clear in terms of how you go about putting the city under administration and Tshwane is nowhere near meeting the criteria of being placed under administration,” says Msimanga.
