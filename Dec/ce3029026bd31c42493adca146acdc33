Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has refuted claims that the State Security Agency (SSA) had instructed her to grant a 2017 order, which directed Parliament to amend the Constitution and change the mandate of the Reserve Bank. It is alleged that Mkhwebane met with senior State Security officials and used the wording that the agency had recommended in her CIEX report. According to a report published by investigative unit, AmaBhungane, this information was given by a whistle-blower who is employed in the Chapter 9 Institution. “The Public Protector rejects all of these allegations and she will respond to all of them in due course. This is just vengeance from current and former employees, who are disgruntled and some of whom were facing disciplinary action. She believes that the intention is to influence the process in Parliament that is spoken about to have her removed from office,” says Mkhwebane’s Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe. Mkhwebane has been under fire for several years now with various quarters calling for her head. On Friday, she suffered another major blow in a string of legal battles she’s been engaged in. The North Gauteng High Court threw out her application for leave to appeal a damning ruling on her 2018 Estina Diary report. The May judgement had declared the report unconstitutional and ordered Mkhwebane to personally pay 7.5% of the legal costs of those who took her to court over the outcomes of the Vrede investigation. The Public Protector will approach the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to challenge Friday’s decision.
