Former President Jacob Zuma has been given until next week to furnish the State Capture Inquiry  with written submissions opposing Redi Thlabi‘s application to cross-examine him. Tlhabi had approached the Commission, saying she would like to cross-examine Zuma following his evidence which implicated the media personality. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo delivered the instructions. “If the former President, Mr Jacob Zuma wishes to say anything in opposition to Ms Tlhabi’s application to give evidence and to cross examine him – he must deliver written submissions to secretary on or before Monday 9 December 2019. If no written submissions are delivered to the acting secretary of the commission on Monday, the chairperson will deal with the application in a manner beamed appropriate.”  In July Thlabi filed the application to cross-examine Zuma after his testimony at the commission implicated her. In his testimony Zuma accused Redi Thlabi of working with foreign agents to defame him. However, Thlabi denied the allegations and wants Zuma to answer for his allegations, which she says are defamatory.
