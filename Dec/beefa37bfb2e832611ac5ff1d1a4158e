Three people have been killed and five others were injured in KwaZulu-Natal this week due heavy rains. Government has urged residents to be cautious and to pay  attention to weather updates as the inclement weather conditions are expected to continue along the coastal areas of the province, including Ugu, eThekwini, Ilembe and uMkhanyakude Districts. Prolonged heavy rains in the province have forced some home owners from the Umhlanga area north of Durban to leave their homes. KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Senzelwe Mzila says communities need to avoid crossing low-lying bridges. “We had an incident here in the province of KZN in the area of eThekwini, in the area of Inanda where several houses collapsed and killed three people. “In the area of eMatikwe, Ngungumane and eTafuleni, disaster management teams are continuing to provide the relevant support to the affected families. We’ve had incidents in eThekwini, Umhlathuze where one of the rivers burst its bank and the communities surrounding were evacuated. Also we had incidents in Pongola and Stanger,” says Mzila.
