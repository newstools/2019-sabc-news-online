Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says there has been a 10% reduction in road deaths in the country thus far this festive season compared to the same period last year. Nearly 1000 people died on the country’s roads during the festive season last year. Speaking to the SABC, Mbalula says drunk driving is still the biggest killer on the country’s roads. “By last year this time around, we were almost at 1000 and then this year we are almost hovering between 400 and 500. Those who are responsible for carrying loads and loads of people have got to be responsible at this time because they take many trips. They have to deal with the issue of being tired on the road and all other things that come with long-distance driving. Unroadworthy vehicles, drunken driving continues to be our challenges.” Last, the Minister indicated that KwaZulu-Natal recorded the highest death toll with 135. It’s followed by Gauteng with 95 deaths, Eastern Cape with 81, Limpopo 73, Free State 56, Western Cape 54, Mpumalanga had 40, North West 36 and Northern Cape with the lowest at 16. WATCH BELOW:
