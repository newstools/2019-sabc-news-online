A second victim has died following a shooting on Umhlanga Rocks Drive, north of Durban. Earlier a woman believed to be in her 30’s died at the scene after she was found in a vehicle riddled with bullet holes. The 35-year-old driver was rushed to hospital but succumbed to his injuries. It is alleged that two vehicles were seen travelling at high speed when fire was opened on the victims’ car. This is the second shooting in the Durban area in the past 24 hours. On Friday a man sustained several gunshot wounds after he was shot at while driving on Buckingham Terrace in Westville, west of Durban. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker says the motive of the Umhlanga shooting remains unclear. “Police at Durban North are investigating charges of murder. It’s alleged that at approximately 13:20 two vehicles were travelling at high speed on Umhlanga rocks drive in La Lucia. It is believed that the occupants of one of the vehicles opened fire on the other vehicle. A woman believed to be in her 30s sustained gunshot wounds and declared dead on the scene. A man in the vehicle was also taken to hospital for medical attention where we learnt he later passed away. The motive of the attack is yet to be established and investigations are ongoing.”
