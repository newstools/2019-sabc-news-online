The Department of Basic Education says social media post suggesting that the minimum pass requirements for mathematics have been “lowered to 20%” for Grades 7 to 9, is fake news. The department has advised parents not to believe the false reports, which have appeared in various news platforms. Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says the fake news was initially reported in 2016 and has since resurfaced. “The fact is that the department has not lowered the pass requirements for mathematics in grades 7, 8 and 9. And we have noted that there are articles that have been shared on social media in which people are also discussing the decision by the department; the so-called decision when in fact, there is no decision. All that is taking place is people are basically sharing an old article of 2016 and even that old article did not quite accurately capture the truth.” Matric results Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to announce the 2019 matric results on the 07 January 2020 and SABC Education will release the matric results to all learners across all nine provinces who registered on its database on the morning of 08 January 2020.
