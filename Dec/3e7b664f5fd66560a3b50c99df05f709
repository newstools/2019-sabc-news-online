The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it will meet with officials from the government and various other stakeholders to chart the way forward regarding the integration of refugees and asylum seekers into South African society. Hundreds of refugees in Pretoria and Cape Town have demanded that the UN High Commission for Refugees relocate them to other countries due to what they say are fears of xenophobic violence in South Africa. The refugees camped outside the UNHCR offices before they were removed. SAHRC Western Cape Commissioner Chris Nissen says, “The commission has taken the initiative of calling today an informal meeting between the role players to see what we can do to assist the asylum seekers and refugees. What we want to do is talk about and find how best we can speak to the communities where people come from but also the other communities to assist in facilitating reintegration into society. We cannot have camps today, we will be talking to local government, home affairs and the police because it cannot continue the way it is, it’s a humanitarian crisis.”
