Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has again rubbished claims by some opposition parties that the new Eskom Chief Executive Officer, Andre de Ruyter, was appointed because Gordhan is against transformation. He was speaking during a question and answer session in the National Assembly involving Ministers in the Economic Cluster. An Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Member of Parliament, Nazier Paulsen, accused Gordhan of not wanting to employ black African executives to senior positions. However, Minister Gordhan says the statistics at State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) paint a different picture. “If you look at some of SOEs that we have responsibility for, some 85% on average of senior people are black, 66% are African. Annual report says they vary 65 – 75% across board so any implication about racism of one kind or another is wrong, and in fact the question is a problematic one.”
