The Road Traffic Management Corporation has urged truck owners to ensure all mechanical faults are checked and dealt with before being made to drive for long distances. This after the N3 Highway was partially open to traffic in both directions. The stretch was closed Sunday night after a truck carrying petrol experienced mechanical issues and caught alight. The incident led to four other trucks also being set alight. RTMC KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Zinhle Mngomezulu-Mali has called on truck drivers to take regular breaks to avoid fatigue. “We urge the owners to double check or get somebody who is experienced in mechanics to check the trucks before leaving the yard. They must also ensure that drivers rest every two hours when travelling long distances.” “They must load the permissible loads into the trucks and obey the rules of the road and try to minimise the night travels.”
