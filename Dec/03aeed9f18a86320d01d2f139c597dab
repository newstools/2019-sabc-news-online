A man and his three-year-old daughter were found burnt to death in their shack at the Ramaphosa informal settlement, east of Johannesburg. It’s alleged that the man deliberately started the fire. He was with his three children in the shack at the time of the incident. Ekurhuleni Emergency Services Spokesperson William Ntladi says the other two children managed to escape. “Apparently at the time of the fire, their mother was not on site. The community tried to frantically extinguish the blaze and to save the victims but unfortunately it was too little too late to save their lives. The scene has been handed over to the police for further investigations and for the removal of charred bodies to an appropriate pathology facility,” explains Ntladi.
