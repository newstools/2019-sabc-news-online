Convicted racist Vicki Momberg is a free woman. She was released from prison late on Friday. It follows President Cyril Ramaphosa’s remission of sentence to 51 000 offenders earlier this month. The former estate agent was sentenced to two years in prison last year after she was found guilty on four counts of crimen injuria. Momberg called a black police officer the k-word more than 40 times when he wanted to help her following a smash and grab incident in 2016. Correctional Services Deputy Commissioner Logan Maistry says: “The Department of Correctional Services confirms that the inmate in question was released from custody on Friday after having reached her sentence expiry date following the special remission of sentence by President Ramaphosa on the 16th of December 2019. She was sentenced to 24 months in custody and her sentence has now expired following the special remission of sentence announced by the President.”
