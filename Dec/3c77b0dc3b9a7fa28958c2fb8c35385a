The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni cannot change her plea or add other SAA directors to her delinquency case. Myeni’s lawyer Nqabayethu Buthelezi had applied for amendments and withdrawals to Myeni’s plea. In March 2017, Organization Undoing Tax Abuse and the SAA Pilot’s Association brought a case against Myeni to have her declared as a delinquent director. Buthelezi said that the evidence he plans to present at the trial – which is scheduled for next year – does not support the admissions made by Myeni in her plea. Last week, Buthelezi said that Myeni may have been ill advised by her former legal representatives from ENS attorneys. He said that Myeni was forced to make denials and admissions on the basis of missing information. The questionable decisions made by Myeni include that of the Airbus transaction, Emirates, the BNP Capital transaction and her conduct in Ernest & Young report.”
