The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema has thanked President Cyril Ramaphosa for his efforts in ensuring that AbaThembu King, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo and the Fees Must Fall activist, Khaya Cekeshe are released from prison. On Monday, Ramaphosa announced that he has granted a special 12 month remission of sentence to specific categories of sentenced criminal offenders, probationers and parolees to mark Reconciliation Day. Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola says this means Cekeshe’s eligibility for parole moves up from February next year, to immediate, while Dalindyebo has been eligible for parole since October. Addressing delegates at Nasrec on the final day of the party’s Second National people’s assembly, Malema says this is a victory for EFF and all students’ activists. The Free Cekeshe Movement says they are not happy with the announcement. One of the organisers is Temaswati Dlamini says, “We are not happy at all because the minister failed to be specific on the date. We are expecting the minister to come here and tell us as students, as students activists on the exact date on when Kanya will be released but the minister is giving us long stories like this process is going to take time. It can take a year. It can be tomorrow. So as students we are not happy with the minister.”- Additional reporting by Maluti Obuseng Click below to watch related video:
