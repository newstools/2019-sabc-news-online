Fifty four undocumented foreign nationals were arrested and three buses transporting them impounded at a road block in Polokwane, Limpopo. The law enforcers have also intercepted a bakkie carrying contraband cigarettes. The cigarettes are valued at over R1 million. Police officers, Deputy Minister of Police, Cassel Mathale and Transport and Community Safety MEC, Dickson Masemola manned a road block to ensure safety of travelers. They also interacted with shoppers at Mall of the North. Traffic flow increased on Tuesday ahead of the New Year. Mathale says police visibility is important to fight and prevent crime. “At the roadblocks we experienced two or three busses from Zimbabwe. They can’t continue with their journey unfortunately. We also managed to stop a fellow who was transporting boxes of cigarettes without the proper documentation. Others were driving vehicles that have been tampered with, while others were driving vehicles that are not roadworthy.” Some shoppers, who were doing last minute shopping ahead of the New Year, expressed satisfaction on police visibility at the malls. One of the shoppers says police should maintain high visibility. “I think it’s a good thing and I like them being here. I think it prevents criminals from targeting here. I like it and I think they should do it more.” At the Polokwane traffic department, people were left stranded as the offices closed at nine in the morning. Some wanted to pay traffic fines, renew motor vehicle disc licences and driver’s licenses, among others. This is what they had to say. “I came to renew my licence and if they are closed, I don’t know what i am going to do. I am afraid that they will fine me on the road if i don’t do it today. I am disappointed. It’s funny – they opened at eight and closed an hour later. I am just her to collect my licence.” Community members were advised to ensure that they’re safe as they usher-in the New Year.
