The Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani has hit out at allegations that he is leading a corrupt coalition, saying the municipality is doing well under his leadership. Bobani made these comments as the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality metro schedules another council meeting with a motion of no confidence against him on the agenda. Two previous meetings to unseat Bobani amounted to nothing as they degenerated into chaos. The metro is yet to appoint a permanent CFO, and is set to lose millions if National Treasury recalls the R3 billion it granted the metro to implement an Integrated Public Transport System, which has been mired in corruption since its inception 10 years ago. Bobani says this coalition was decided at national level and therefore regional efforts will not succeed. He said, “This municipality is functioning well, we are paying our employees, our finances are in a sound footing and also we are having more than R2 billion in our account. So there is no reason for the removal of the mayor because the mayor has done nothing, there is a political administration…” “There is also administration that is functioning and also financially we are fine. So we will experience these motions but this coalition government is not going anywhere,” added Bobani.
