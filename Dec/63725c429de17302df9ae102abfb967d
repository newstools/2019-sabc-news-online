The former Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani says he believes he will be reinstated as the mayor when the merits of his case are heard. Bobani lost the first part of his application to have his matter heard on an urgent basis by the Port Elizabeth High Court. He was ousted through a motion of no confidence during a council meeting two weeks ago. Judge Lisa Ntsepe found the matter is not urgent and dismissed the application with cost. Bobani explains: “The Judge found it not to be urgent. But it is clear that there is still a chance on the demerits of the case. And what we will be doing right now – I have already consulted with my legal team – We will eave no stone unturned… We will go ahead with the matter. We want the matter to debated. We want the merits of the matter to be discussed and debated in court and we won’t oppose this judgment because it was just about the urgency.” WATCH BELOW:
