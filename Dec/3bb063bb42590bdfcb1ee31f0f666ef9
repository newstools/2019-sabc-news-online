A man who was arrested at the OR Tambo International Airport, east of Johannesburg, with heroin worth R3 million is expected to appear in court on Tuesday. The suspect was on his way to board a flight to Portugal via Qatar when the drugs were found in his luggage. This brings to seven the number of suspects arrested for drugs at the airport over the past six week. Last month police confiscated cocaine worth more than R4 million. “The six accused have already appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrates’ Court and they have all been remanded in custody,” says Police Spokesperson Brenda Muridili. Meanwhile, three alleged drug dealers have been arrested in Limpopo and Pretoria. “Members of the organised crime unit and the drug team in Limpopo conducted an operation that led to the discovery of the drug lab. One suspect was arrested in Tzaneen and the other two in Pretoria. The provincial commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has hailed members who were involved in this operation and also thanked members of the community who are continuously giving valuable information to the police. The suspects will appear in court for possession and dealing with drugs,” says Police’s Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo.
