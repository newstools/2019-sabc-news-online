The office of the Presidency says President Cyril Ramaphosa has cited major concerns over load shedding in the country as he prepares to be briefed by Eskom. Eskom is set to brief the President on measures being taken to help solve the electricity crisis, after days of continued load shedding which has left the country in a bit of a crisis. Ramaphosa cut short his official visit to Egypt, after holding official talks with President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, to address problems facing the power utility. He is also set to visit flood ravaged communities in Gauteng. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Khusela Diko, says there are several questions that need to be answered over the future of Eskom. “He is very concerned. Some of the explanations Eskom is putting forward are not really sufficient. We are supposed to show that we are on top of issues of maintenance and the challenges that have come up over the past week or so. But the biggest problem that the President has is the fact that we are looking at Eskom holding the country to ransom…” “He said in a number of occasions that Eskom is too big to fail. But the question that we keep asking ourselves is to what extent do, we save Eskom in its current state, while we are not looking at – for example – additional generation capacity from elsewhere,” adds Diko.
