Two people have lost their lives and two others sustained slight injuries in a car crash on the R-390 in Hofmeyer near Cradock in the Eastern Cape. It is alleged that the driver lost control and the car overturned. Officials say speed and fatigue could be the main contributing factors. Over 80 people have already lost their lives during the festive season in the province. Transport spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, “It is an accident that is very disturbing, an accident that comes at a time when the volume of traffic has increased on our roads. We would like to call on motorists and all road users to obey the rules of the road at all times. We will ensure that our law enforcement officers are also on the ground. They are busy ensuring people get home safely. We do expect that the volume of traffic is going to continue to increase as this is the last weekend before Christmas.” Traffic officers are on high alert Friday afternoon as many South Africans make their way to holiday destinations before Christmas. JMPD spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar, “Traffic volumes are increasing on all of the major freeways including the N1 towards Limpopo, the N3 towards KZN is also getting very busy. Motorists are reminded to drive within the speed limit and not overtake where it is not safe and motorists should not drink and drive. Roadside check operations will be held on a 24-hour basis in the Johannesburg area and officers will monitor the major freeways. Every 50kms there will be officers present to monitor the freeways.”
