Government has announced what it calls digital transformation plans to enable South Africa to respond to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) challenges. Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams  told the media in Pretoria that they are embarking on a process of improving operational efficiencies in government entities. These include licensing of the High Demand Spectrum, fast-tracking the roll-out of broadcast digital migration and building a big data economy. “We are currently finalising the business case and awaiting certification from the state law advisor and DPME (Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation) with regards to re-purposing SITA (State Information Technology Agency) to create a state IT Company, as well as merging Sentech and Broadband Infraco to form the state digital infrastructure company. We are further engaging our counterparts to ensure that non-broadband SOEs that self-provide broadband such as Sanral, Prasa, Eskom and Transnet are prohibited from entering the commercial broadband market to avoid state distorting a well-functioning liberalised market.”
