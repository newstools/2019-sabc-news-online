Cape Town police have arrested three suspects in separate incidents in Mitchell’s Plain this weekend for the alleged illegal possession of unlicensed firearms. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk says a 33-year-old man was caught in Beacon Valley when police saw him hiding a firearm in a tree. He will be charged with tampering with the serial number of a firearm and ammunition. In another incident, a local resident told members of the Anti-Gang Unit who were on patrol in Beacon Valley, that he had been shot by a person known to him. Police searched the suspect’s premises and found a black 870 Remington shotgun and ammunition in a cupboard. A 50-year-old man was arrested. On Saturday, in Tafelsig, members attached to Operation Lockdown arrested a 24-year-old suspicious-looking man after finding an illegal firearm and ammunition in his possession. All three will appear in the Mitchell’s Plain Magistrates Court Tuesday.
