Businessman Adam Catzavelos has pleaded guilty to a charge of crimen injuria in the Randburg Magistrateâ€™s Court. This follows two unsuccessful bids to have the charge withdrawn. Earlier this year, Catzavelos submitted representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions to have the charges against him dropped after the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions denied his representations in which he requested that the charges against him be withdrawn. This case follows a self-recorded video of Catzavelos in which he utters the K-word while on holiday in Greece in August last year. In the video, he is seen celebrating a lack of black people on the beach. He will be sentenced in February next year. The Economic Freedom Fighters brought the case against Catzavelos.
