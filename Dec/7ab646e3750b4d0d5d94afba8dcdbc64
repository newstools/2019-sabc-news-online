The Department of Water and Sanitation says the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) tunnel has been re-opened with water already reaching the Saulspoort Dam in Bethlehem in the Free State. The replenishing of the tunnel will allow for water to flow into the Integrated Vaal River System, which includes the Vaal Dam that is currently at 40.2%. The tunnel was shut down in October to allow for inspection and maintenance. “All the inspection and maintenance work has been done and the tunnel is in operation. We started recharging the tunnel on the 20th of November in order for us to be able to start letting the water flow into the system. Now the water is flowing into the Saulspoort Dam in the Free State where once it is filled, the water will then flow into the integrated Vaal river system in order to be able to ensure the security of water supply to the province of Gauteng,” says Department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau.
