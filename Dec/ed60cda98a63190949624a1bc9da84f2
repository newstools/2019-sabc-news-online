The University of South Africa (Unisa) says it is investigating complaints from independent contractors who claim they have not been paid for several months. The contractors say Unisa’s lack of communication with them has made it difficult for them to assist the payment process. Acting Director of Communications Lusani Netshitomboni has called on the independent contractors to provide information to the institution on payments required to be made. “As a University, the delaying of the processing and payment of service providers is regrettable. This matter was brought to our attention late on Friday and when we checked with the relevant units, there wasn’t sufficient information to say this is what happened. We need to go back to our system and ask what went wrong here; is it our system, or incomplete documents from their side? We are not so sure at this stage. We are escalating this matter and will have some response by tomorrow,” says Netshitomboni.
