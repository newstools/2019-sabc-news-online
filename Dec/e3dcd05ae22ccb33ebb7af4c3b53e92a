Tau Lekoa mine management near Klerksdrop in the North West says they are still working to extract the remaining four workers trapped underground. Five workers were trapped by a rock fall about 1350 metres below surface. This follows two seismic events. Mine management says in a statement that one of the five miners trapped underneath has been rescued and hospitalised. Rescue teams have been sent to the mine, to assist. Mineral Resources Department spokesperson, Ayanda Shezi, says they have also sent inspectors. “The department inspectors are onside at the Tau Lekoa mine as part of the rescue efforts which started yesterday evening. Our understanding is that there was a tremor incident that coursed the fall of ground incident that lead to the workers getting trapped underground. We don’t have much detail at the stage but we will continue to provide the update as the rescue continue.”
