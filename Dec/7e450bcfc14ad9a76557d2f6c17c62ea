Renowned musician, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, has denied that her visa was revoked in Uganda due to her support for an opposition politician, Bobi Wine. Uganda’s Daily Monitor website reports that Chaka Chaka recently praised Wine as the ‘new Mandela’. She has also denied being deported from the country. However, the police have confirmed that she has been deported due to an incorrect visa. In a video posted on her Twitter account, Chaka Chaka says she took a decision on her own accord not to perform at a New Year’s Eve concert. “Hello this is me. I just want to set the record straight. I am here, all is well I took a decision not to appear this evening at Enkuuka because there just too many things that I could not understand or explain but not deported, not arrested, not captured I know my country is worried, my people are worried, my husband is worried, everybody is worried – but I am fine.”
