The National Union of Metal Workers (Numsa) has rejected President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s contention that sabotage was partly to blame for load shedding. President Ramaphosa was speaking at Megawatt Park in Johannesburg. He said that possible acts of sabotage that led to the blackouts will be investigated by police and intelligence services. The alleged sabotage apparently occurred at the Tutuka Power Station in Mpumalanga.  However, Numsa is adamant that load shedding challenges facing South Africa are the result of a failure of leadership at Eskom and the African National Congress (ANC). Numsa’s Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says Eskom management is responsible for the crumbling infrastructure at the power utility. “We must say, as Numsa, we are quite surprised to hear these allegations of sabotage, which are being used as a basis of an excuse for the blackouts, which have rolled out across the country. As Numsa, we are saying this situation is as a result of a failure of leadership at Eskom. It has been a complete failure to deal with maintenance since 2012 and it’s actually confirmed that the failure of it is a result of failure of Eskom and government. They are refusing to deal with the actual cause of the problem.” Watch the video below for more on the story:  President Cyril Ramaphosa, click the video below:
