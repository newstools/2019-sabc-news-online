The National Assembly has suspended voting to recommend the appointment of Kholeka Gcaleka as Deputy Public Protector. Also, voting on the recommendation for the appointment of former Msunduzi Mayor Zanele Hlatshwayo to the position of Public Service Commissioner failed to get the required recommendation. 201 MPs are required to vote in favour of the appointment. National Assembly House Chairperson Cedric Frolick announced that the resolution on the matter of the Deputy Public Protector will take place later on Wednesday. “Honourable Chief Whip of the opposition, I am just requesting that the Whip of the ANC that went around … I think it’s the Deputy Chief Whip who is talking to the different Whips, that they should meet as soon as possible and then before the sitting starts this afternoon, to inform us of the outcome of those discussions that have taken place in terms of Rule 100.” “And then, we will take a decision. However, the decision on the question on this will stand over until after order eight dealing with the adjustment appropriation bill.” For a related video click below:
