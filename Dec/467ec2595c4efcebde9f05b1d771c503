The COP25 Climate Change conference in Madrid, Spain, has heard that 65-million jobs can be created globally if the world commits to climate action targets. Research suggests that a green economy represents a 26-trillion-US-dollar growth opportunity. This comes as South Africa grapples with load shedding and amid calls for a rapid transition from coal to a green economy. Addressing a plenary at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 – Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the fastest-growing job creators are those related to solar, wind and geothermal energy. He says when governments move from grey to green economies – it’s important to ensure that job retention and creation is inclusive of race and gender. Guterres says that all countries need to retrain people so that they can switch careers and nobody is left unemployed in the transition from grey to green economies. He says it’s important to take the gender balance into account and create fair and decent jobs to boost social equity. Guterres says that low carbon futures must be inclusive – ensuring that all nations are moving at the same pace. This is to guarantee that developing nations aren’t being raided for resources and human capital but treated as equal partners. Related video click below:
