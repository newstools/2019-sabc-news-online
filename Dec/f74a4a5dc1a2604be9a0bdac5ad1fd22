The African National Congress  Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal is protesting against the granting of bail to the alleged murderer of Sindisiwe Ndlovu outside New Hangover Magistrate’s Court. Ndlovu was a provincial executive committee member of the ANCYL. It is believed that Ndlovu was shot and killed by her boyfriend in Crammond in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands earlier this week. ANCYL Secretary in KwaZulu-Natal Thanduxolo Sabelo says they want the suspect to be denied bail. “We do not believe that he must be granted bail and he must be amongst our society. We do believe that he must stay incarcerated until he gets his sentence which we believe it’s going to be a life sentence.” “So we will be doing this also to send a clear indication and warning to anyone who is a perpetrator of this gender based violence to say enough is enough, not in our name, it’s not going to happen again.”
