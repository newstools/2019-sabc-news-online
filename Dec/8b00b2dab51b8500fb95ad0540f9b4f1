Cabinet has called on South Africans to pay attention to warnings on severe weather conditions that could cause a negative impacts. This follows recent cold and wet weather conditions, causing thunderstorms to rip through parts of the country, wreaking destruction on several homes and roads. Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, addressed a media briefing in Pretoria on the outcomes of last Friday’s Cabinet meeting. Mthembu says, “Cabinet calls on the public to listen to alerts and tips on severe weather conditions. Fast moving floodwater is life threatening and drivers and pedestrians are urged to be extremely careful. Avoid using routes which have been flooded. Residents who live below the flood line of rivers and dams are warned to be cautious and move to safer areas at the earliest sign of flooding.” Cabinet has also called on motorists to obey the rules of the road and exercise caution, as traffic routes become busy amid the festive season. Mthembu has urged motorists to be considerate of other road users, to help avoid crashes. “Cabinet calls on all South Africans to observe the rules of the roads as they make their way to their holiday destinations in the festive season. The responsibility to reduce the carnage on the roads lies with every one of us. Responsible behaviour on the roads includes not drinking and driving, driving within the speed limit and being considerate for other road users, including pedestrians.” Click below to watch briefing:
