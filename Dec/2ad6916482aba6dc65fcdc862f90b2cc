The Cape Winelands District Municipality says fire services continue to battle the uncontained fire in the mountains above McGregor. Cooler conditions during the night allowed them to make good progress in the areas that are accessible. There are however a few spots high up in the rocky areas of the mountains that crews are unable to access. 60 ground teams and firefighters are assisted by six purpose built fire vehicles. Aerial support is currently water bombing the fire line. Spokesperson for the Cape Winelands District Municipality, Jo-Anne Otto says 18Â 000 hectares of vegetation have been burnt. She says damage to property includes a guest cottage and some damage to a residential property. No injuries or loss of life has occurred.
