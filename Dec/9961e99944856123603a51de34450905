Trade union Solidarity says the unconfirmed reports of South African Airways (SAA) going under voluntary business rescue, comes as a shock as the airline’s management along with the Department of Public Enterprises has opposed the union’s attempt for it to be placed under business rescue. According to a memo that was leaked from The Secretary of Cabinet it is alleged that SAA should go under voluntary business rescue. Solidarity’s Chief Executive Officer Dirk Herman says they will meet with SAA management along with the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Deputy Judge President on Thursday morning regarding their application.
