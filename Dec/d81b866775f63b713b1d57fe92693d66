The Oudtshoorn Municipality in the Little Karoo has advised residents to boil their tap water. Recent rains in the catchment area of the Raubenheimer Dam and flash floods have resulted in muddy water entering the dam. Municipal Spokesperson Ntobeko Mangqwengqwe says the water quality should return to normal in a few weeks. “The quality of the water is monitored on a regular basis and tests done after the recent rain still indicate no presence of E.Coli.  It is however recommended that water for drinking purposes be boiled until the water quality is back to normal,” says Mangqwengqwe.
