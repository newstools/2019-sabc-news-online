A woman has been shot dead and a man injured in a shooting in Umhlanga Rocks Drive, north of Durban. The two were found in their vehicle that was riddled with bullet holes. The woman, who was the passenger in the vehicle, was declared dead on the scene. The driver was rushed to the hospital. This is the second shooting in the Durban area in the past 24 hours. On Friday, a man sustained several gunshot wounds after he was shot at while driving on Buckingham Terrace in Westville, west of Durban. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says it is not clear what the motive of the latest shooting was. “I can confirm there was a shooting on Umhlanga Rocks Drive, where a woman was fatally shot by unknown suspects and the man that was with the woman sustained injuries and was taken to hospital for medical attention. Charges of murder and attempted murder will be opened for investigation at Durban North police station.”
