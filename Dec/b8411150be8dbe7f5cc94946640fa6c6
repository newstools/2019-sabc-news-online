Four people have died in three separate fire incidents in Cape Town on Sunday morning.  A spokesperson for the City’s Fire and Rescue Services, Jermaine Carelse says firefighters responded early on Sunday morning to the first incident of informal structures alight in Disa Road, Klipfontein Mission Station and Philippi. He says the body of a man was discovered in one of the structures and a woman was treated and transported to a nearby hospital for burn wounds. “Then at approximately 03:00, the Service responded to a house alight in Matshoba Street, Khayelitsha. Despite the courageous efforts of firefighters, CPR was terminated on an adult male whilst a woman was transported to the hospital for burn wounds. And at 04:50 we responded to structures alight at Siqalo Informal Settlement, Philippi.  Firefighters took less than an hour to extinguish the blaze. Unfortunately, the bodies of two men were discovered during mopping-up operations. All these scenes were handed over to the South African Police Service.”
