President Cyril Ramaphosa is on a three-day West African tour. He has started his working visit to the Republic of Guinea on Tuesday. Heâ€™ll then visit Ghana before ending his trip in Togo on Friday. A statement from the Presidency indicates that the visit takes place in the context of strengthening the already existing bilateral, political and economic relations between South Africa and the three West African countries. The visit also comes ahead of South Africa assuming the chairmanship of the African Union in January next year.  South Africa is one of the largest foreign direct investors in Ghana, mainly in mining, communication, beverages, retail and franchising. Several South African companies are operating in Ghana, including, inter alia, MTN, AngloGold Ashanti, Shoprite, Goldfields, Standard Bank, First National Bank, Barclays/Absa, Multichoice and South African Airways (SAA). The working visits will provide an opportunity for South Africa to explore new areas of cooperation with Guinea, Ghana and Togo. For more watch video below:
