The Tshwane African National Congress (ANC) caucus claims the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Executive Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has been absent without official leave. The caucus says it plans to request an urgent council meeting and petition the Speaker, Katlego Mathebe, to grant their plea. Mokgalapa came into the spotlight when allegations of a sex scandal and political plotting surfaced last week through an audio recording that went viral on social media. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and ANC thereafter tabled a Motion of No Confidence, which was disallowed by the Speaker on Thursday evening. The ANC’s Tlangi Mogale says: “Regarding the issue of council and the Mayor having gone AWOL, the ANC rejected the special leave that was presented to council and we – with other parties in council – will petition the Speaker to convene an urgent special council, where we will proceed with our Motion of No Confidence on the Executive Mayor and the Speaker as well.” Watch related video below:
