The University of Cape Town‘s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng has applauded the hands-on approach of its outgoing Chancellor Graça Machel. Machel was first elected in 1999, and in 2010 she was re-elected to stay on for another 10-year term. The former first lady started concluding her presiding duties at the summer graduation ceremonies at the university on Thursday.  Her tenure comes to an end on the 31st of December. Professor Phakeng praised the outgoing Chancellor for her untraditional approach during her time in office. “Mam Graca Machel was not a traditional Chancellor. Normally what Chancellors do they only pop in during graduation or official university ceremonies and mam Graca was there for us during tough times to cry and comfort, with us during times of achievement and celebrations.  She was there to celebrate with us and she never waited for us to invite her, she would make herself available.”
