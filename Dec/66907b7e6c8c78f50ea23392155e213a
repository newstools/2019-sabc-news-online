Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has described the late head of the army, Lieutenant General Thabiso Mokhosi, as a dedicated cadre who always prioritised service to the country. Mapisa-Nqakula was speaking at Mokhosi’s funeral service in Port Elizabeth. Mokhosi died at the age of 51 after a short illness. While paying tribute to Mokhosi, the Defence Minister says the National Defence Force has lost a selfless leader who was at the pinnacle of his career. ” Those of us who have had the opportunity to work with General Mokhosi and seen him blossom over the years can attest to an officer who exhibited the highest quality of leadership, commitment and dedication to the course of our people. Incidentally, I met Mokhosi when he was probably 17 or 18 in the bushes of Angola.” Related video below:
