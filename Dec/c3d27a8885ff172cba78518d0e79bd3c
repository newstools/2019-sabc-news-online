A commission of inquiry into taxi violence in Gauteng is expected to hold its first hearings in Johannesburg on Thursday. The commission comes after a recent spate of taxi-related violence in Orange Farm south of Johannesburg and Centurion since Monday. In Olievenhoutbosch five people were killed and nine others wounded following disputes over routes. On Tuesday seven suspects were arrested in Lenasia following a shooting incident involving taxi operators. Commission spokesperson Koena Moabelo says the inquiry has been set-up to establish the cause of the taxi violence in the province. “The commission of inquiry has been set up to look into the causes of taxi violence in Gauteng. You will understand that Gauteng is currently submerged in this taxi violence and this is very unacceptable. So the commission has actually been given a task to investigate the fatalities, the underlying reasons for the recurring conflict, violence and the instability in this taxi industry,” adds Moabelo.
