12 soldiers have appeared in the Swartkop Military court in Pretoria in connection with Monday’s break-in at a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) base in Pretoria. 11 of the men were arrested on Monday and another one on Friday morning. About 19 R-4 rifles were allegedly stolen from the Military Inventory at the SA Army Engineering Formation in Lyttelton, Centurion. Four officers, a Captain and 3 lieutenants appeared in court alongside 8 non-commissioned officers. It is still unclear what charges they are facing. The media was not allowed inside the court, and have been ordered to remain outside the gate of the premises where the matter was heard. Family members have however been allowed to attend the proceedings. The SANDF is denying that the weapons have been found, but according to National Defence Union Secretary, Pikkie Greeff the weapons were retrieved near Hammanskraal, a day after they were stolen.
