The South African Police Service has warned people not to leave their belongings inside their vehicles. This after a vehicle was stolen at Goble Road in Durban with a Telkom Knockout replica Trophy and tickets to this weekend’s final inside. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Jay Naicker says police are investigating a case of robbery. “The provincial vehicle task team as well as the tracking company responded swiftly. Police officers gave chase and the vehicle was found abandoned at D Section in Lindelani. When the police found the vehicle, they discovered a Telkom Knockout trophy and 49 match tickets inside the vehicle. “Officials at Telkom have since confirmed that the trophy is actually the replica used for promoting the event. We are appealing to people to ensure that their vehicles are locked when they go to sleep at night and not to leave any valuable in their vehicle.” Naicker explains.
