 The Public Protector will petition the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) following the North Gauteng High Court ruling that’s dismissed her leave to appeal the judgment on her  Estina Diary farm report. Judge Ronel Tolmay dismissed the matter with costs. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane had hoped the court will grant her permission to have a May ruling, which  declared her report on the diary scandal unlawful and uncostitutional reviewed. She also wanted leave to challenge a cost order against her arising from the same case. Public Protector spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe says they will approach the Supreme Court of Appeal following the disappointing ruling. “Obviously the public protector is disappointed with this we would’ve expected a different outcome. But this is not the end of the road for us. We will be petitioning the SCA to challenge judgement of the high court. It has done its part and its time for us to approach the SCA with the hope of a different outcome,” says Segalwe. The project at the centre of the storm was a multi-million rand Free State government initiative aimed at benefiting emerging farmers, but turned out to be a cash cow for the politically connected individuals. Former Free State Premier Ace Magashule and former MEC for Agriculture Mzebenzi Zwane were alleged key players in the scandal. Mkhwebane’s 2018 report on the matter, however, made no findings against the duo. It also emerged she hadn’t questioned them during investigations. Watch related video:
