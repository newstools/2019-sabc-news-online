KwaZulu-Natal’s water supplier Umgeni Water has warned communities living along the banks of Umdloti River on the north coast of Durban not to go close to the river as the levels have risen drastically. Umgeni says the water capacity in this river rose after they had released water from the Hazelmere Dam which was at 80% as a result of good rain. The levels had to be released to 55% for safety reasons. Umgeni Water Spokesperson Shami Harichunder says: “They (residents) must not go close to the Umdloti River. There is a risk to their personal safety as there is quite a lot of water. The level of Umdloti River has risen quite dramatically and it could pose a risk to them if they go anywhere close. There are also two pedestrian bridges, one at Cognent and the other in eMathabeni. We are also appealing to them not to use these bridges because of the risk that they could drown if they use that bridge. Please assist us for the next three days.”
