Eskom will implement Stage 2 loadshedding on Sunday from 9am until 11pm. The power utility had implemented Stage 1 loadshedding overnight. Eskom has asked customers to reduce demand to lessen the level of loadshedding. Meanwhile, residents in some parts of Vanderbijlpark are up in arms after being left without power since Thursday. Spokesperson for the Emfuleni Municipality, Stan Gaba, says this is a result of loadshedding. He also says the consistent rain in the area has contributed further to the problems. “Because of the consistent rains that are falling in the area, most of our substations are getting blown up or we are having more outages because of the substations. As we experience rain they get blown up but our electricians are working on restoring power.” “We apologise for the power outages but it should be noted that it’s as a result of loadshedding,” Gaba adds.
