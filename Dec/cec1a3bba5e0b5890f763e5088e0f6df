Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has again appealed to motorists to comply with the rules of the road and not to drink and drive. Mbalula was launching the City of Joburg’s road safety campaign at Crown Mines in Johannesburg on Monday. The minister says people should do all the necessary checks before taking long trips this festive season. “For those who do not obey the rules, the law will be on them and the rule of law will be thrown on them. They will be arrested. In Johannesburg alone, road blocks are going to intensify.”  Meanwhile the Western Cape Ministers of Community Safety and Transport are set to meet to discuss the stone throwing incidents on the province’s roads. Both Albert Fritz and Bonginkosi Madikizela have condemned the attacks taking place along the N1 highway.
