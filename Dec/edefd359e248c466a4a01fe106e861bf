Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has opened the newly-upgraded N2 road, between Mtunzini Toll Plaza and Empangeni just south of Richards Bay on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. The 33km upgrade cost R1 billion.  It’s now a dual carriage highway.    Mbalula says the road will help with access to KZN’s harbour route. “About 1.8bn has been spent here to upgrade these roads and it has been opened up to ensure our roads are able to carry us. The opening of this road is important in terms with the link of the harbour. I am elated about the completion of this work.”
