Lobby group AfriForum on behalf of the family of slain soccer star Senzo Meyiwa, has called on the NPA to open an inquest into his murder. The Meyiwa family approached AfriForum to assist with investigating Meyiwa’s murder which remains unresolved, five years later. Meyiwa was gunned down, allegedly by a robber at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s home, in Vosloorus. AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel says they want to test the evidence through an inquest which might eventually lead to a prosecution. “The best positive part of an inquest is that you’ll have people under oath, the eight people that were in the house will have to give evidence under oath, so Advocate Gerrie Nel will be able to cross-examine and we know of course cross-examination is one of the best tools to make sure we unearth the truth.”
