Two people have died and one seriously injured in a crash on the N2 between Higginson and Edwin Swales in Durban. The vehicle they were traveling in reportedly lost control and went down an embankment before bursting into flames. Rescue Care Paramedic Spokesperson Garrith Jamieson has urged motorists to use alternate routes.  Meanwhile, the Higginson Highway on the N2 north-bound in Durban has been closed to traffic until further notice after a truck carrying gas cylinders overturned, resulting in a gas leak. Durban Metro Police Spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad says clean-up operations could take a few hours.
