The National Assembly has passed the 2019 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement and Adjustments Appropriation Bill. The bailouts of state-owned companies dominated the debate. Some opposition parties questioned this, saying it took the much-needed services from the poor. The Democratic Alliance’s Geordin Hill-Lewis says it is time for government to take the bold decision and get rid of the troubled national carrier, South African Airways (SAA). Hill-Lewis says, “Minister Gordahn says that all South Africans must support SAA. Even now that shows that after R20 billion in bailouts he still cannot pry himself away from his ideology that no matter what it costs the government must run it. Well let me say no, no, no Minister Gordhan. The most patriotic thing that every South African to can do this Christmas is to help shut down South African Airways.” Click below to watch related video:
