South Africaâ€™s dedicated polar research vessel, the SA Agulhas, with environmental scientists on board will set sail from Cape Town to Antarctica on Friday. Scientists representing the Indian National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research will conduct research on changes in weather patterns, global warming and space weather. The South African Maritime Safety Authority says most researchers are expected back in about three months.
