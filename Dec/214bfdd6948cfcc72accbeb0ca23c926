South Africa has spent around R5 billion over the past five years to deport undocumented foreign nationals who live in the country illegally. It also spent over R8 billion to maintain ports of entry at various border posts. The department is currently considering the deployment of additional personnel at border posts as part of the security plan for the festive season. The department is now pinning its hopes on the new Border Management Authority Bill to address some of the challenges at border posts.  Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi briefed the media in Pretoria on Sunday. “In the meantime, the Border Management Authority (BMA) Project Management Team has been busy finalizing the technical work acquired to establish the border management authority. I have directed them to focus their initial efforts in strengthening the border lines between South Africa in Limpopo and Zimbabwe. SA in Mpumalanga and Mozambique as well as SA in KZN also with Mozambique,” says Motsoaledi.
