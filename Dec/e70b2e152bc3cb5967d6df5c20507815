Nine people were trampled to death early on Sunday after two suspects being chased by Brazilian police entered a party with roughly 5 000 people, according to a police statement. Police officers were chasing two men riding a motorcycle when suspects fired guns against them in Paraisopolis, a poor neighbourhood of Sao Paulo. The suspects entered a party playing funk music, causing a stampede, the police said. Another seven people were injured and taken to the hospital. The statement said police were chasing the men because they were disturbing the neighbourhood. It was not clear if they were apprehended.
