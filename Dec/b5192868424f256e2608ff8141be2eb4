Eskom says it’s currently not load shedding, but power supply could be interrupted as a result of a local outage due to a technical fault.  Consumers can report power outages to Eskom on 0860 037 566 or MyEskom Customer App. Eskom says despite a constrained and vulnerable system, no load shedding is expected on Thursday, the Day of Goodwill (Boxing Day).  Spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says, “Eskom is currently not load shedding the system is quite constrained, however, we do not believe that we will need to load shed today. There may be some areas that may be experiencing localised outages; we advising customers to please call the call centre in such an event so that we can get our technicians to attend to that fault. We will give you updates should anything change in terms of the state of the system. But as it stands there is no load shedding for today.” Click on the video below:
