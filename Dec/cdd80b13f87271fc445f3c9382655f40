Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has appealed to road users to play their part in making sure that roads are safe this festive season. He says road safety is nothing without people. Mbalula made the appeal when he launched the National Festive Season Road Safety campaign at the Harrismith airport in the Free State. Fatalities remain a major concern on South African roads. Drunk driving and speed are the main causes of the road carnage. Mbalula says this year, they’ve invested in technology which they are using to reduce deaths on the roads. “We are spending millions of rand on capacitating our traffic capacity in the republic and that must be put into good use everywhere. Now, when you are drunk, we don’t wait for tomorrow, up until you high blood pressure goes down and drunkenness disappears, we arrest you right there.”
