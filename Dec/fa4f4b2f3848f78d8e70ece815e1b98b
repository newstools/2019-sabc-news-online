Government has imposed a ban on all livestock auctions. Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Thoko Didiza has gazetted a national ban on gathering cloven-hoofed animals, including livestock auctions, shows and similar activities. This follows an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Limpopo. All owners of livestock have been encouraged to observe strict bio-security measures on their premises. Chairperson of the Red Meat Producers Organisation in the Northern Cape, Johan van der Corf, says the move will have a significant impact on the livelihood of farmers.
