As the final day of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) National People’s Assembly continues, the party will adopt new policies on land reform, economy and health and education. The party’s newly elected leaders will go back to grassroots level and implement all the resolutions taken at the second national conference. The EFF also amended its constitution and elected an additional five members to its Central Command Team. The team now consists of 40 members excluding the party’s top six, with more than 50% of them being women.  They include Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Eight commissions are currently sitting and discussing the party’s policies. They are expected to report on their deliberations later on Monday. Watch the video below for more:
