The Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) are finalising plans to move forward with placing the City of Tshwane under administration. This was announced on Friday by MEC Lebogang Maile in Johannesburg. Maile says amongst the reasons for placing the City of Tshwane under administration is the frequency of unauthorised and irregular expenditure as per the Auditor General’s report, as well as the current financial crisis the City is faced with. On Thursday, the Democratic Alliance Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa and Speaker, Katlego Mathebe were ousted in motions of no confidence. Maile says they will be placing the City of Tshwane under administration. “The Provincial Executive council will be starting the process of invoking Section 139 of the Constitution, which is read together with Section 154. The Department of COGTA will be working out the details and the plan in terms of how that is going to be implemented – including informing the relevant authorities like the minister of COGTA, the NCOP, the legislature and the municipality itself.” Click below to watch related video:
