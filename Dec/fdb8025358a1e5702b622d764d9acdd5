Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula will release preliminary statistics on the festive season road fatalities on Monday next week. On Tuesday, Mbalula inspected the National Traffic Control Centre as well as the Gauteng Central Operations Centre, to assess progress made since the launch of the department’s Festive Season #LiveBeyondDezemba #ArriveAlive campaign. The Minister has commended law enforcement officials for their road safety efforts thus far. Mbalula’s spokesperson, Ayanda Allie-Paine, says: “By the looks of things we are certainly on the right track. We are not where we once were and we are headed in the right direction.” “So Minister Mbalula appreciated traffic officials and police officers who have sacrificed family time this time of the year in order to keep our roads safe. The minister also urged them never to tire and he called on them to continue to do their work and do it with excellence, do it with diligence as well.” Related video click below:
