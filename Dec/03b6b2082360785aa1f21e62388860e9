The troubled Naledi Local Municipality based in Vryburg in the North West says it has reached a payment agreement with Eskom following the power cuts in some parts of the municipality. The municipality owes Eskom over R300 million. Municipality Administrator Paul Maseko says they will pay Eskom R2 million every month from their equitable shares. “We have an arrangement that we will pay Eskom R2 million a month…after being put under administration. We did make some means of enhancing our revenue so we are in a position to honour our R2 million debt going forward,” says Maseko.
