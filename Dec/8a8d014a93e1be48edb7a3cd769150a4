Former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane says he has no plans to start a new political party.  Maimane stepped down as party leader in October after the election of Helen Zille as federal council chair. Speaking to SABC News, Maimane says he intends remaining in politics, working to spark a citizen-led movement to hold political parties accountable to the electorate. “There are 48 political parties in this country so I think 49 less than ideal. What we need is a system that will allow accountability to work better.” “I don’t want to go back into just a simple plethora of political leaders. If you ask me what my new job is,  I am an activist, I am really back to being a citizen activist who’s meeting with citizens and saying how do we advocate for their issues, so that the voice of citizens is not left behind,” says Maimane. Maimane has come out strongly against racial politics in South Africa. He says diversity is an important issue in South Africa. Click video below:
