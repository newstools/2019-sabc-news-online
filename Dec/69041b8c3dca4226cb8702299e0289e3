The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport has called on motorists driving underneath bridges along the N3 and N2 to be cautious. This as incidents of rock throwing are believed to be recurring along some parts on the highway, similar to incidents that occurred last year. It is believed that the intention is to rob people. Department spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane says security has now been re-enforced on many bridges. “Law enforcement agencies will increase visibility and security along the bridges along the highway N3 and N2. This following the recent report suggesting that the incidents of rock throwing are now back. The syndicate that is operating is aiming the high way. This is a very serious crime as it causes major fatal accidents but also create unnecessary havoc on the road.”
