Negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 are yet to be concluded. The meetings were supposed to wrap up on Friday, but parties could not reach agreements on several issues. Activists have already criticised this conference for failing to finalise the implementations details in the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The time for the closing plenary where agreed documents on action will be adopted, has been pushed back three times since Friday night. Parties have been struggling to find each other over two key central issues. The first being about carbon markets and how the West should enhance their reduction targets while financing mitigation and adaptation in the developing world. The second is the mechanism of how to fund loss and damage in the Global South. Developing countries are holding steadfast demanding strong commitments or no deal at all. Watch a related video below:
