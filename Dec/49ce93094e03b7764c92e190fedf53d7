More than 70 refugees will appear in court at the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Services Court in Pretoria. The accused were arrested after they allegedly forced their way onto the United Nations (UN) property on November 14. This was in a bid to escape a court order which forced them to disperse from the pavement outside the UN premises where they had been camping for more than a month. Hundreds of refugees were staging a sit-in, asking that they be resettled in another country as they did not feel safe in South Africa. The State has indicated that it is willing to enter into mediation with a number of interested parties. Watch the video below for related news:
