A suspect linked to nine murder cases has been nabbed at Amangwe Village in KwaMbonambi, north-west of Durban. It is alleged that the 25-year-old was found with an unlicensed firearm. A second firearm with 13 rounds of live ammunition was also found in his home. The firearm was later linked to nine murder cases in Amangwe and surrounding areas that happened during 2017 and 2018. Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula says investigations are still under way as there could be more murder cases associated with this firearm. “The suspect was placed under arrest. He was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with 13 rounds of live ammunition. Investigations conducted among the detectives revealed that the firearm was used in six cases of murder committed in Amangwe during 2017 and 2018 as well as other murders committed in Elandsgate, Jeppe and Moffat View.” In another crime-related case, three suspects have been arrested after an investigation into a murder and a house robbery where firearms and cash were stolen. It is alleged that four armed men entered a house and opened fire resulting in a 58-year-old man being fatally wounded. Police provincial spokesperson Jay Naicker says the suspects were arrested in their homes at Elangeni and Muden near Greytown.
