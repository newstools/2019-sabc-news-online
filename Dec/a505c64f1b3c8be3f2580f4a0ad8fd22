Johannesburg Emergency Services are on high alert after the South African Weather Services issued a warning for flash floods in certain parts of the city. Gauteng and some parts of the country are experiencing severe thunderstorms and rain.  Hotspot areas for flooding include Alexandra, Stjwetla, Kliptown and Ivory Park. Motorists have also been advised to avoid low-lying areas. “Residents in those areas need to monitor the water levels. Our motorists, who are driving, they need to extend a safe following distance and try and avoid crossing flooded roads and flooded bridges, so that we can prevent incidents where vehicles might be swept away due to the severe thunderstorms,” says Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi.
