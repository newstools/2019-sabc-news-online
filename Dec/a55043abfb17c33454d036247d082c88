The eThekwini Municipality has declared war against all criminals who will be visiting the city intending to commit crime during the festive season. The municipality has launched its Festive Season Management Plan to outline its readiness to host thousands of holidaymakers who will be visiting the city. The municipality says more law enforcement agencies will be deployed with the aim of ensuring the safety of holidaymakers. Among the attractions in the city is the new eight kilometre beachfront promenade that starts at the Blue Lagoon and ends at the Point Waterfront, making it the longest in Africa. EThekwini Municipality Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has issued a warning that law enforcement agencies will be out in full force. He says they will be working with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to ensure that cases involving tourists are resolved urgently. “The National Prosecuting Authority has also been brought to deal with crimes perpetrated against tourists. We have appealed to the SAPS and the NPA to endure that cases involving tourists must be dealt with speedily because they are in the city for a short period of time. We don’t want to delay our tourists when they are here,” says Kaunda. Kaunda says that as part of minimising congestion at the beachfront, the municipality will again use the park-and-ride system. “To minimise traffic congestion at the beachfront, Metro police will enforce the traffic management plan. The city will once again implement the park and ride system that will be based at the old drive-in site. Our visitors will be ferried to the beach via shuttles and no taxis and buses will be allowed on the beachfront,” adds Kaunda. Visitors are cautioned to refrain from drinking and swimming and leaving children unattended in public places.
