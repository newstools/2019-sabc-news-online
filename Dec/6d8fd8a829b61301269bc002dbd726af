Residents of the flood-stricken Botshabelo in the Free State are trying to piece together their lives following the torrential rain, which left a trail of destruction in its wake. Many residents in Botshabelo have been left destitute following three days of heavy downpour. Residents say they have lost furniture and valuable documents. A relieved Kgauhelo Lefeta says he and his two-year-old daughter were lucky to survive. “I fell into the water with the child panicking screaming for help but someone heard us. So what I intended to do was to run for safety.” On Monday, emergency personnel rescued eleven initiates who were trapped at a flooded stream near Botshabelo. Mangaung Metro spokesperson Qondile Khedama says they are busy maintaining their infrastructure. “Our infrastructure teams are out there to open trenches to allow the free flow of water. The other thing we requested is land grabs, it is dangerous because during floods most of them occupy floods lines. Because we are making sure that we conduct public education particularly during a disaster so that people can fend for themselves during disasters.” The South African Weather Service has warned of more floods.
