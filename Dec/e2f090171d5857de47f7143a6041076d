The man, who is accused of intimidating members of the municipal workers union (Samwu), Thabo Sibanze will appear again in the Thohoyandou Magistrateâ€™s Court in Limpopo, on Monday. Thabo Sibanze allegedly sent threatening messages to Samwu leaders who criticised the Vhembe District Municipality for investing more than R300 million in the liquidated bank. The case against Sibanze was postponed last week for a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Magistrate Thifhuriwi Ligege told the court that if the DPP fails to take decision, he will make a ruling in the case to decide on whether the case should be provisionally withdrawn or transferred to the regional court for trial. According to the NPA, Sibanze could be linked to the killing of two Samwu leaders, Timson Musetsho and Ronald Mani. The two were gunned down in two separate incidents in Thohoyandou earlier in 2019.
