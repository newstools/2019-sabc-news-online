The African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have voted out the Tshwane Council Speaker Katlego Mathebe, with 111 votes. The no-confidence vote against Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa, which was delayed by several interruptions, will follow shortly. This after the Speaker of the house was allegedly “chased from her seat” and her deputy ended up being accused of “smelling of alcohol”. Tshwane Speaker Katlego Mathebe recused herself pending a motion of no confidence against her. Meanwhile, the DA is drawing up legal documents to challenge the appointment of EFF acting speaker, Obakeng Ramabodu as well as all the decisions taken after his appointment as Speaker in the Tshwane Council. DA provincial leader John Moodey says they will bring the urgent court application as soon as possible. The DA contends it is illegal to elect an acting speaker when the Speaker, as well as the City Manager, are available to preside over the meeting. The motion of no-confidence in the Speaker, Katlego Mathebe, was successful with the ANC and EFF voting for the motion and the DA refusing to vote. Moodey says the DA will not walk out of the meeting but will also not participate in an illegal process.
