The family of Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe says he is happy to be home. Chekeshe was released from prison in the early hours of Tuesday morning. He had been serving an eight-year sentence, three of which were suspended, at Leeuwkop prison in Johannesburg for public violence and malicious damage to property. Cekeshe pleaded guilty to setting a police vehicle alight during a Fees Must Fall protest in 2016. He is one of the thousands of prisoners who were granted a special remission of sentence by President Cryil Ramaphosa on Reconciliation Day. His uncle Mnikelo Madala says the road to clearing his name is long. “He is happy to be home. He understands that the struggle is not just over yet for him. Ultimately we trying to get him cleared officially and get the record expunged. But he understands that can be a process.” Click below to watch related videos: Department of correctional spokesperson Chrispin Phiri says his parole is subject to certain conditions.
