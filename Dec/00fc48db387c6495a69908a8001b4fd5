South African Communist Party (SACP) General Secretary Blade Nzimande has told nearly 800 delegates that it will not give the governing party a blank cheque ahead of the 2021 local elections. He told the delegates on the second day of the party’s Special National Congress in Kempton Park, that the SACP reiterates its continuing electoral support for the African National Congress (ANC). Nzimande says that the SACP’s support must be within the framework of a reconfigured alliance. “We must maintain ANC… lead ANC lists… however whereas with the forthcoming local government elections, the agreed spirit of the configuration of the alliance, as well as consensus-seeking consultation is undermined. We urge our structures to report that to the Central Committee with recommendations – what is to be done may include that in a place like Maluti-a-Phofung we cannot support what the ANC is doing… we cannot campaign for the ANC with the local government being in that state.” Watch Nzimande’s address below:
