Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Xolile Nqatha has visited families affected by a  tornado in the Raymond Mhlaba Municipality in the Eastern Cape. 50 families in 10 villages were affected by the tornado that hit late in November. The affected villages are Msobomvu, Bergaplaas, Bienfield and Khayalethu in Alice, and Magaleni and Mabheleni in Fort Beaufort among others. Watch the video for more on the story:  Nqatha says they are assisting these families with groceries and 50 mattresses. “For 50 families who are destitute after the tornado, Human Settlements and our disaster management centre have done the assessment and we are looking at intervening in the houses that were partially destroyed and those that were totally destroyed. We are following those processes, but today we delivered those measures as a relief to the affected families.”
