It was a year of exhilarating highs and soul-crippling lows. 2019 brought us South Africa’s 6th democratic elections, a  Rugby World Cup trophy, and the deepening scourge of gender-based violence. Politicians played musical chairs with metropolitan mayors, as the electorate looked on. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Democratic Alliance had irreconcilable differences, while the Fighters and the African National Congress (ANC) put their differences aside to take over Tshwane. SOE’s were in turmoil, with Eskom implementing Stage 6 load shedding and SAA being put under business rescue after receiving bailouts during the year. There were attacks on, and looting of, foreign-owned shops, leading to retaliatory attacks against South African businesses. KwaZulu-Natal experienced tornadoes in quick succession and torrential rains, while the Eastern Cape drought continued. President Cyril Ramaphosa met Daisy, Minister Blade Nzimande warned us about the ‘blood in our alcohol’ and Tweeps showed generosity to a mom in distress when her electricity ran out.
