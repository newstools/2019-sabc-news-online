South Africa is facing daunting challenges, but they are not insurmountable. This is according to Democratic Alliance Leader John Steenhuisen in his Reconciliation day message to South Africans. Monday marks National Day of Reconciliation with President Cyril Ramaphosa set to address the main event at Bergville in Kwazulu-Natal. Steenhuisen says if people can act immediately and harness the power of all who have the best interest of South Africa at heart, the country will still have enough time to overcome the daunting challenges it is facing. He further said he disagrees with the notion that coalition governments do not work due to their collapse and voting agreements in certain metros. In addition, Steehnuisen says he would have thought that the scars of the countryâ€™s divided past were well on their way to healing; and that the symbolic freedom of 1994 would have translated into what he calls real, substantive freedom for millions of South Africans who had been locked out of opportunity and the economy. But he says in reality, the country is rather beset by crippling poverty and deep divisions.
