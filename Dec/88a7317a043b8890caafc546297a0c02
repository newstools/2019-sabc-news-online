The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it has made a request for Parliament to be part of a meeting to discuss South African Airways’ (SAA) business rescue plan. DA Member of Parliament (MP) on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Alf Lees, says the party has written to the chairperson of the committee to make a request to Independent Business Rescue Practitioner, Les Matuson that they be part of the general meeting. Les Matuson, who has been appointed as business rescue practitioner in South African Airways’ voluntary business rescue process, has announced that he would be calling a general meeting of all SAA stakeholders within 10 days. Lees said MPs must represent the taxpayers who have paid out around R57 billion in bailouts into SAA over the past few years. “There is no question that Parliament is a stakeholder in SAA and the future of SAA. In particular the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), which postponed a meeting with SAA this week in order for the business rescue process to be engaged with,” expressed Lees.
