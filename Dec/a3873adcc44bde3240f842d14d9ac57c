National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, says the 6th Parliament began on a slow start but the Assembly could move with speed to tackle certain outstanding matters. Modise gave her assessment of the first six months of the 6th Parliament which kicked in after the May 2019 general elections. “This year I think we started off with a number of members, which made us slow to start. You would remember there were contestations about lists and it took a little bit of time to put structures to elect chairpersons. But I am very happy that we caught up and we have been able to gain the time we lost. We have had all our structures in place, our policies in place. We have concluded the shortages, the lacks that we have seen in our rules. We have fixed that. We have even put into place the rules which will enable us to remove the Chapter 9 institution heads if the need arises, which is a great, great thing,” says Modise.
