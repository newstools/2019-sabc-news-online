Eskom says it will implement stage two loadshedding nationwide from 4pm until 11pm Thursday evening. The power utility says this is due to a shortage of capacity and a highly constrained system. Citizens have been advised to check the load-shedding schedule on Eskomâ€™s website to know when power cuts will be effected in their areas.
