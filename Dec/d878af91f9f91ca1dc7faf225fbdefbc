Five people died in three separate fires in Cape Town on Christmas Day, while one suffered severe burn wounds. A spokesperson for the City’s Fire and Rescue Service Jermaine Carelse says several structures were destroyed and two men died in Masiphumelele in Hout Bay. Carelse says in the Siqalo informal settlement another man died and several dwellings were destroyed. “The City’s Fire and Rescue Service also responded just before 12 to informal structures alight in Vrygrond, Lavender Hill.  The crews were confronted by an extremely volatile crowd and police presence was requested. The bodies of two men were discovered whilst a third suffered 80% burn wounds and was taken to a nearby hospital. All these scenes were handed over to the South African Police Service.”
