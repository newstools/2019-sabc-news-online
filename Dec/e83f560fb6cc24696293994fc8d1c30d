The N3 Toll Concession says of the 933 crashes recorded between January and October this year, 570 of them involved single vehicle crashes. It says this includes head-tail collisions, side swipes and multiple pile-ups which points to negligent driving, speeding, distractedness and ignoring road signs. The N3 Toll Concession manages the N3 Toll Route between Cedara in KwaZulu-Natal and Heidelberg in Gauteng. With many companies closing for the festive season from Friday, traffic is expected to start picking as holiday maker’s travel to various destinations for the festive holidays. N3 Toll Concession’s Con Roux has urged motorists to obey the rules of the road. “Adhere to the rules of the road, drive more defensively and to guard against complacency. We are asking motorists for their undivided attention while they are driving. Avoid distraction particularly from mobile devices and stay alert at all times. Make sure you rest, there are wonderful rest stops along the route and make sure that you are not fatigued in anyway.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
