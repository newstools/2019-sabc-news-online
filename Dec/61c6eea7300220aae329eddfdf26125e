The Department of Communications and Digital Technologies has confirmed the withdrawal of Newyear Ntuli’s appointment as the  Administrator for the Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa (Usaasa). Department’s Spokesperson Nthabeleng Mokitimi-Dlamini says Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams revoked the appointment on Wednesday after verifying allegations of sexual misconduct against Ntuli with the South African Post Office (Sapo). Ntuli left the post office a few years ago after claims of him sexually harassing some staff members surfaced. Mokitimi-Dlamini says the Minister was not aware of the allegations when she appointed Ntuli as a report from Sapo had indicated that he had resigned without detailing reasons for the move. Ntuli was appointed on a 24-month contract at the Usaasa to fast-track the roll-out of the government’s digital migration efforts.
