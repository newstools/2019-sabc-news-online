The Council in the City of Tshwane is on Thursday afternoon set to hold a special meeting for a motion of no confidence in the Speaker Katlego Mathebe and Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. Mokgalapa came into the spotlight following what is being dubbed the ‘sex in the city’ scandal and alleged political plotting after an audio recording that went viral on social media. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the African National Congress (ANC) then tabled a motion of no confidence which the Speaker disallowed last week. Tshwane has 214 seats. The Democratic Allliance currently has 92, the ANC has 89 and that makes the EFF the ‘king makers’ with its 25 seats. Both the EFF and the ANC had previously indicated they would work together to oust the DA’s Mokgalapa. Click below to watch related video:
