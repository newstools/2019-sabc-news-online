Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and her Gauteng counterpart Lebogang Maile are expected to visit areas in Gauteng affected by flooding due to the heavy rainfall. Hundreds of people mostly living in informal settlements across the province have been displaced. About 700 shacks were washed away in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria on Tuesday after the Moretele and Hennops rivers burst their banks. Gauteng CoGta spokesperson Castro Ngobese says the visit is part of their undertaking to make sure that they assess the damage. “They will also see what intervention the government can offer to the affected residents and communities. The MEC is deeply concerned about what is happening, but disasters are disasters, and they are not human made… it’s nature. As government, we are deeply concerned and there are plans that the MEC will outline during his visit.”
