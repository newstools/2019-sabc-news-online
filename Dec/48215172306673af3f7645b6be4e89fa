Police are searching for two suspects after yet another taxi killing at Olievenhoutbosch taxi rank in Pretoria. Authorities say a taxi official belonging to the ARMSTA taxi association was shot by two men who fled on foot. Gauteng traffic police spokesperson Obed Sibasa says police have launched a manhunt for the two suspects. This comes after a Commission of Inquiry into Taxi Violence in Gauteng began in Parktown, Johannesburg. It will probe the violence that has now claimed the lives of at least eight people in the past two weeks in the province. In another incident Sibasa says two men were found selling guns close to the taxi rank. He says: “One suspect was arrested by the Gauteng traffic police and the second fled the scene in a silver grey Ford Ranger. The arrested suspect claimed to be from KwaZulu-Natal.” “Police are on a manhunt for the suspects and hope to make arrests soon.” Meanwhile, Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko has instructed law enforcement agencies in the province to crack down on taxi violence. Her spokesperson Pinkie Numa says the MEC wants a safe festive season in the province. She says: “Mazibuko has instructed law enforcement agency heads in the province of Gauteng to make sure that no stone is left unturned in ensuring that taxi violence is resolved and to ensure that commuters are safe during this festive season.”
