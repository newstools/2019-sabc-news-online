President Cyril Ramaphosa has addressed the power crisis in the country in his monthly news letter to the nation. Ramaphosa says heÂ  visited Medupi power station for the first time two weeks ago. South Africa has been struggling to keep the lights on for the last week and is experiencing load-shedding countrywide. Ramaphosa says Medupi is a fitting symbol of the importance of state-owned enterprises, while power station Kusile accounts for much of the financial crisis at Eskom. He has acknowledged that there have been other factors, resulting in power cuts including state capture, corruption, loss and shortage of essential skills and mismanagement. Ramaphosa also reiterated that there was no other way of saving South African Airways (SAA) other than placing it under business rescue. Click link below for more on the story:
