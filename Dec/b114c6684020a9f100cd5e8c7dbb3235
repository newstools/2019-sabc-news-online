Kgetlengrivier Local Municipality in Koster near Rustenburg in the North West has apologised for the delayed payment of salaries to its workers. Workers have not yet received their salaries for December. As usual, the workers were expecting their salary payments on the 13th of this month, but to date no payments have been made. Besides the delayed payment, the workers say they are faced with a myriad of challenges. South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) says they will only go back to work, after their issues are addressed. Local shop steward, Mapule Maemela, says, “We will go to work when we see the salary. If they pay today (Tuesday), we can go back to work.” However, the municipality says the payments have been processed after receiving the late payment of their equitable shares from Treasury. “You will recall that we are one of the municipalities that their equitable shares were actually withheld by the provincial government. The equitable shares have since been released to us, but unfortunately, because of the previous unspent conditional grants the equitable shares had to be withheld again,” says Municipal Manager Joseph Mogale.
