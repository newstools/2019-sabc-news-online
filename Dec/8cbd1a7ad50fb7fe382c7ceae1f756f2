The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it has managed to pay the outstanding amounts owed to most of its local content providers. This follows a partial bailout received from government. In October, the cash-strapped public broadcaster received a R2.1 billion portion of the R3.2 billion it requested from government. Spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo says payments for local content providers are being managed. “We can confirm that we have reached our local content commissioning production payment obligations with local content providers. We can also confirm that we have settled all outstanding cash flow production payments and have made efforts to engage the relevant production houses that might still need closure before final payments are released. We would like to take this opportunity to invite the industry to continue partnering with us in aiming the SABC to a sustainable and commercially viable entity,” says Seapolelo.
