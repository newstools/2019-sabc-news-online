R8000 per household has been allocated to assist those whose homes were damaged on Christmas Eve in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. The money will be used to rebuild more than 400 homes. Two lives were lost since Monday in the province. It was not a merry Christmas for the Creighton community. Roofs were blown away and homes flattened as rain and storms swept through Ubuhlebezwe, uMzimkhulu and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma municipalities on Christmas Eve. “I was in the house when the wind blew. Life is hard for us, we would like to get help to rebuild our homes,” says one of the residents. The government has intervened. MEC for Human Settlement Peggy Nkonyeni says they have introduced a service provider that will give them building material. Disaster management teams remain on high alert as forecasters warn of more heavy storms expected.
