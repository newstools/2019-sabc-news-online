The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has appealed to the public to heed a Knysna Municipality warning not to swim at beaches between Herolds Bay, Sedgefield and Wilderness Beach. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon says very rough sea conditions are being experienced along that part of the coastline. “Victoria Bay beach is opened, lifeguards are on duty. But the municipal lifeguards between Herolds Bay Sedgefield are advising bathers not to enter the water due to very rough conditions being experienced there. The municipality will advise when conditions allow for bathing to resume.”  Meanwhile, Parks and Recreation head Thembinkosi Ngcobo says parents who intentionally dump their children around Durban beaches and pick them up later in the evening will face the full might of the law. “We have taken some major steps this year to ensure that problems we have been experiencing in the previous years do get to a large extent avoided. What we have learned out of this experience is that there are still parents who will come dumping their kids here in the morning and they disappear intentionally and then only come back in the evening to collect them. We will still make an appeal therefore, more especially young parents please don’t come and abandon your children here it is not allowed it’s against the law.” Sandboarding in Eastern Cape The Eastern Cape is gearing up to welcome thousands of visitors to the province.
