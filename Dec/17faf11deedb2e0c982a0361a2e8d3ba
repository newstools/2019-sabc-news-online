African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule says the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) has noted with concern the recent load shedding situation across the country. He has been addressing a media conference at Luthuli House in Johannesburg on the NEC meeting held on the 8th and 9th of this month. Magashule says they’re calling on government to give clarity on the steps taken to address load shedding. He says firm action is required to improve the performance of SOEs in the country. Meanwhile, small businesses say they have been negatively affected by load shedding because they have to close shop during power cuts. On Monday, Eskom implemented stage six load shedding — the highest level since the power utility introduced rolling blackouts in 2008. Eskom has continued with stage two load shedding Wednesday.
