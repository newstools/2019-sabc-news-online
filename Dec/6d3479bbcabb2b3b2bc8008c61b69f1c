Police are appealing for help in identifying the seven bodies found dumped on Putfontein road next to the N12 near Daveyton on Gauteng’s East Rand. One of the deceased was burnt beyond recognition while the other six were partially burnt with what appeared to be gunshot wounds to the upper body. The motive for the killings is not yet known. Gauteng police spokesperson Noxolo Kweza has asked anyone with information to contact the police on 08600 10111… “Police are still in the process of identifying the bodies which are all males. It is suspected that the males might have been killed underground and might be part of the on-going illegal mining activities. Police received a call from a passer-by who saw the bodies.  Anyone with information can contact the police anonymously on 08600 10111”. Click on the video below:
