Former President Jacob Zuma has been given time until December the ninth to furnish the State Capture Commission with written submissions opposing Redi Tlhabi’s application to cross-examine him. Tlhabi had approached the Commission, saying she would like to cross-examine Zuma following his evidence at the Commission which implicated her. Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo says if former president Zuma has anything to say in opposition to Tlhabi’s application for leave to give evidence and cross-examine, he must deliver written submissions on or before Monday, 9 December 2019 – failing which proper action will be taken by the Commission. The Deputy Chief Justice has granted Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe leave to give evidence, call witnesses and to cross-examine former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi and Richard Le Roux. “If the former president, Mr Jacob Zuma wishes to say anything in opposition to Ms Tlhabi’s application to give evidence and to cross examine him – he must deliver written submissions to the Secretary on or before Monday 9 December 2019. If no written submissions are delivered to the acting Secretary of the Commission on Monday, the chairperson will deal with the application in a manner beamed appropriate,” says Zondo.
