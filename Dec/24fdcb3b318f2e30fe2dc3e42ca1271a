The Mossel Bay municipality in the Southern Cape has called on its residents and holiday makers to donate much needed water to drought stricken farmers in the Karoo. Teams will deliver water on Tuesday to Karoo towns that have run out of the essential resource. Last month, a water outreach drive also helped struggling farmers in the Klein Brak River area. “The Mossel Bay Municipality have urged holiday makers to donate water for the last water drive for 2019. The delivery to the drought stricken communities and the farming communities in the Karoo, will leave tomorrow, 3rd December. Towns such as Merweville have no water left in their taps. Please deliver donations to the fire stations in either Mossel Bay or Great Brak River or the hartenbos library,” says Municipality spokesperson, Nickey le Roux. Meanwhile, the shortage of water supply in Ka Nyamazane and surrounding areas, east of Mbombela, Mpumalanga continues after a water pump broke last week. Residents have been urged to use water sparingly until the pump has been fixed. City of Mbombela spokesperson, Joseph Ngala says they have made a provision for clinics and hospitals. Ngala says the pump is expected to be installed on Monday evening.
