National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says an agreement has been reached with the Samancor Ferrochrome Mine near Brits in the North West, where workers were forced to camp inside the mine premises until the early hours of Friday morning. This as they were demanding their bonuses from the mine management. Numsa says the mine failed to fulfill its promise of paying workers bonuses earlier this week. Numsa Regional co-ordinator Oageng Chose details the agreement. “When we were there, the first salary were paid. In this afternoon they will be paying the outstanding bonuses which were supposed to be on the 13th December. We are happy with the agreement provided – whether they will be complying because they have been relegating from the agreement. We had agreed that they will pay on the 13th, they changed to the 17 and 18th until on the 19th workers decide to say they do not go underground until they get the money.”
