The Anglican Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane says he is pleased with Archbishop Desmond Tutu‘s response to his medication in hospital. Ndungane visited Tutu on Thursday and found him to be ‘alert as ever’. He says the 88-year-old is receiving good medical care and is in good spirits. Tutu was hospitalised in the Mother City on Wednesday. He has been treated several times over the past few years for a similar condition. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997. Ndungane says they prayed together.
