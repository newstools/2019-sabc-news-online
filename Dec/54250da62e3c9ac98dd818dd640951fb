The Department of Home Affairs has assured South Africans that the country’s border posts are well guarded despite the occurrence of some security breaches. This follows video footage on social media showing scores of foreign nationals jumping over the border fence between South Africa and Mozambique. Home Affairs Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi told the media in Pretoria on Sunday that this is a matter of serious concern. “We are aware of video doing rounds of a serious security breach. We can confirm that this between our border with Mozambique, not very far from Libombo border post. But as you have seen in the video, it did not happen on the border post – it happened along the border line. The reason we want to speed up the Border Management Authority is to deal with eventualities like these, and want to assure South Africans that we take this matter very seriously.”
