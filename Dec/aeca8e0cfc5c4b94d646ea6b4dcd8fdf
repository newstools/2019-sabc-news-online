Eskom has announced that it will increase its loadshedding from stage four to stage six from this hour. The power utility says this is as a result of a shortage of capacity following a technical problem at Medupi power station which is impacting additional generation supply. This comes as South Africans battle power cuts which started with stage two load-shedding last week. Eskom says the incessant rains in various parts of the country are making it difficult for it to reduce load shedding. It says the rains are continuing to flood some power stations and ultimately affecting its efforts to improve its electricity supply. Meanwhile, business owners in the North West are feeling the pinch of load shedding. They say they’re finding it difficult to operate without electricity, a situation which is forcing them to turn customers away. The business owners say they have lost thousands of rands. “This load shedding is a problem and those who are coming for lunch, its disaster and I have to pay R27 000 for rent and also I have to pay the employees so where am I going to get that money,” says one distraught  business owner. ” Load shedding is affecting us and now. We are on festive season and I lost so many customers,” adds another one.
