The African National Congress’s highest decision making body in between conferences, the National Executive Committee, is currently meeting at the Lakes Hotel and Conference Centre in Benoni as the country endures continued load shedding. Another issue under the spotlight is the placing of South African Airways (SAA) under business rescue. ANC spokesperson says Pule Mabe the meeting will also dwell on a wide-range of issues. “On the agenda of the NEC is the political overview which has already been given by the President of the ANC, the report of the NWC given by the Secretary Genaral to the NEC which of course reflect on the state of the organisation. “The political overview will be looking at a number of topical issues of national and international interest. Whether it’s a state of our SOE’s, including relations with other countries both in the region and beyond region, considering the fact that South Africa is expected to take the chair of the AU effective from next January.”
