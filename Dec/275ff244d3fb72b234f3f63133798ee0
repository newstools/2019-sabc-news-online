Johannesburg’s new executive mayor, Geoff Makhubo, has promised that his new executive will hit the ground running after being sworn in on Tuesday. Makhubo introduced his team at a council meeting at the weekend after the ousting of the Democratic Alliance (DA). Makhudo says the city’s finances are not in a good state and service delivery has ground to a halt.  He says they will go back to basics fixing roads, cutting grass and repairing traffic lights. Makhubo announced Jolidee Matongo as Finance MMC. Four of the ten MMC positions went to opposition parties including the IFP’s Mlungisi Masondo who takes over as housing MMC.
