Deputy President David Mabuza has called on South Africans to use the Christmas season to commit to building a country they desire. Mabuza says South Africa should be a country where poverty and unemployment is not a defining feature. In his Christmas message on behalf of government, Mabuza reflected on the highs and lows of democratic South Africa. He described 2019 as having been a tough year for the country as the economy continued to strain, leading to job losses. The Deputy President also touched on the natural disasters, such as the severe drought gripping some parts of the country. He reiterated government’s promise to prioritise young people and women as it continues efforts to rejuvenate the economy. Mabuza urges South Africans to work together for South Africa’s benefit. “Let us equally love and care for our neighbours as we love and care for ourselves. We must heed the call found in the parable of the good Samarithan. Thus we are called upon to be brotherly and care for the less fortunate as it is in our nature and humanity to do so.” Watch full message below:
