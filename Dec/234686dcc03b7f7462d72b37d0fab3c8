The Durban Metro Police have raised concerns about the number of drunken related incidents reported so far this festive season. So far, 66 people have been arrested for drink related cases since the start of the festive season in Durban. During the long weekend, one person was stabbed to death and another seriously injured in what is believed to be incidents related to alcohol consumption. eThekwini mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, says those who are arrested might only be released after New Year’s Day as many courts are going into recess. “Those who will be arrested, we’re saying unfortunately you might spend the rest of these holidays in jail. Those cases which might be fast tracked are only those that affect tourists. It’s important to behave very well. Those who want to drink and celebrate please make use of Uber, Taxify and other available services.” To help reduce the number of drunken related incidents, the Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Nomalungelo Gina is expected to visit various areas around the Durban CBD on Thursday to raise awareness around the dangers of drinking alcohol, especially during the festive season. Gina’s visit is part of the National Liquor Awareness Campaign. The purpose of this campaign is to educate and create awareness about the dangers of alcohol abuse, particularly during the festive season. The city is expecting a large number of domestic tourists between now and the New Year.
