A massive beach clean-up is taking place on Durban’s coastline. Residents and tourists took to social media expressing their shock over the excessive amounts of rubbish and debris strewn across various beaches. Head of Parks, Recreation and Culture Unit at the eThekwini Municipality Thembinkosi Ngcobo says over the past days they have experienced heavy rains. “I can confirm that over the last five days we have experienced very heavy rains that pounded the coastline and some of the inland areas and that has caused a lot of debris to come through onto the beaches. Right now I’d say over the last three days or so we have started a lot of work to remove the debris and I’m hoping that come Friday this week, all the debris will be removed,” says Ngcobo.
