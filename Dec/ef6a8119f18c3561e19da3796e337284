Algerian presidential candidate, Azzeddine Mihoubi cast his vote on Thursday morning  in the long election despite months of protests against it being held. Ex-culture minister Mihoubi is among five presidential candidates also including ex-prime ministers Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Ali Benflis former tourism minister Abdelkader Bengrine, and Abdelaziz Belaid, a former member of the ruling FLN party’s central committee. The army, the strongest political player, sees the election as the only way to restore order by naming a successor to Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was toppled by a popular uprising earlier this year after two decades in office. The huge protests that brought down Bouteflika have persisted for 10 months, and the demonstrators have sworn to boycott the election. All five candidates that won approval to stand are former senior officials, including two former prime ministers, and protesters say none is likely to challenge the army’s dominance.
