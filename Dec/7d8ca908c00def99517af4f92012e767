The African National Congress (ANC) says it will bring motions against all Democratic Alliance (DA) members in the Tshwane council next week. This follows Friday’s High Court ruling in Pretoria that suspended the removal of the DA’s Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and Speaker Katlego Mathebe, pending a full review. The DA approached the court to review a decision by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the ANC to remove the two through a motion of no confidence passed earlier this month. The court also suspended all decisions taken during that council sitting, including the appointment of the EFF’S Obakeng Ramabodu as acting speaker. ANC Tshwane Chairperson Dr Kgosi Maepa says: “On the 3rd of January, we will impress on the speaker that we want to continue…We’ll put a motion on everybody else from the DA who is trying to buy time. We know that the DA wants to use all other formats and trying to confuse everyone and say they are going to negotiate. There’s nothing to negotiate with the DA, the inevitable is coming. The DA must leave the city. People don’t want them anymore.”
