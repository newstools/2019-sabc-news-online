The National Freedom Party (NFP) says fathers have an equal role to play in the lives of their new-born children. This is according to National Freedom Party MP Achmed Shaik Emam. This comes as amendments to the Basic Conditions of Employment and Unemployment Insurance Acts come into effect from Wednesday. The amendments will allow for 10 days paid parental leave for fathers of new born babies. The same right is also extended to surrogate mothers. Shaik Emam has welcomed the changes in the legislation. “I think for a long time this matter has been deliberated on and fathers have an equal role to play in the lives of their unborn children and more importantly their children at large. So, this new development I think it’s a great development. It must be welcomed and it must be encouraged. And we call on all employers to ensure that they abide by this and ensure that all employees that are entitled to parental leave particularly fathers of new born children are given that opportunity and that they are fully paid for. We also welcome that fact that children born to surrogacy, particularly the mothers will also be entitled to also get an additional 10 days paid leave annually,” says Emam.
