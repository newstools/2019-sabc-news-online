University of South Africa (UNISA) says it is not quite sure why some students have not yet received their exam results as it says 99% of its students have indeed received their marks. This comes after some students took to social media to voice frustrations over delayed results. The results were supposed to have been released six days ago. UNISA says there might be a host of issues causing the delay and that those experiencing problems should contact the university, but will only be assisted when the university re-opens in the new year. Spokesperson of UNISA Lusani Netshitomboni explains, “We are saying more than 99% of the results have been released. But we are saying that there might be cases of students who haven’t received their results. It could be technical, or maybe they haven’t paid their fees. We will only be able to know the major problem of the query once we have received those queries at Exams at UNISA then we’ll be able to investigate and get back to the students. The queries and the questions will only be attended from the 2nd of February next year. But if the students can send those queries to us as soon as we open in January, we’ll be able to attend to them.”
