Former Free State Premier, Ace Magashule’s personal assistant, Moroadi Cholota has told the Commission of inquiry into State Capture that it was a norm for her to approach business people for funding, on behalf of the premier. She referred to an email she sent to the late businessman, Ignatius Mpambani, where she was requesting traveling funding for students, amounting to  R250 000 in 2016. Cholota says the funding was for travel requests that would come through the office of the Premier, be it by students or other groups from across the province. She says, “If you work in that kind of an environment, that’s where you get to know if a kind of request you get will help you at some point on how to deal with them.” “So as time goes by, I will know that there is a certain gentleman who assisted a certain group, I will note you down, in case I need you in the future. I am not sure if you are aware that the establishment of this request for funding for students has been there long before I arrived.” Meanwhile, the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has wrapped up its proceedings for the rest of the year. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says the hearings will now resume on January 13. Zondo says if there are any application hearings by those who have been implicated during evidence, that will be allowed in between. “There might just be a hearing of some application or other in between if a need arises, but in terms of witnesses giving evidence, this is the last witness for this year, we will then, we adjourn.”  Click below to watch related video:
