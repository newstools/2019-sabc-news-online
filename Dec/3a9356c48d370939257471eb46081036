The Cape Winelands District Municipality Fire Services says windy conditions are hampering firefigthing efforts to contain a veld fire in the mountains above McGregor. This as mopping up operations continue in the Southern Cape where a veld fire claimed several structures and animals in the Gouritzmond area. At present, there is no threat to other structures. The fire started in the Overberg town of Greyton last week and was fanned by hot, windy conditions that allowed it to spread into the Winelands area over the weekend. Municipality spokesperson Joanne Otto says firefighters are currently managing two fire lines. “The fireline on the La Chasseur side was mostly contained by last night after the combined efforts of aerial and ground teams. A ground team will stay in the area to perform mopping up and monitoring activities today. The fire line in the Kloof, known as ‘die Galg’, is currently between five and six kilometres long. The fire services have deployed six fire fighting vehicles and two fresh ground teams to manage the fire line,” says Otto. Fire authorities say firefighting teams will remain on high alert.
