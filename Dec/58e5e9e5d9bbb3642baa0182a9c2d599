The former mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay metro, the United Democratic Movement’s (UDM) Mongameli Bobani, is challenging his ousting in court. The matter will be heard in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday. Bobani was removed through a motion of no confidence on Thursday morning. UDM president, Bantu Holomisa, says Bobani’s removal can be likened to a kangaroo court. “His removal was illegal in that the motion itself was not on the agenda. He advised that he will use the constitution of the country to challenge the removal.”
