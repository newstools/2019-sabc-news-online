The Scourge of Gender-Based Violence took centre stage at the 6th annual Nelson Mandela Remembrance Run and Walk in Pretoria.  South Africans participated to honour the legacy of the late former statesman. The 2019 event coincided, with the annual campaign of 16 days of No Violence against Women and Children. The run provided an atmosphere of some Madiba magic for the gloomy weather, not even the rain dampened the runner’s spirits.  Over 20 000 people braved the dawn rains to take part in the 21 kilometres and 5 kilometres walk and run. Mandela’s Granddaughter Ndileka Mandela says perpetrators of gender violence should remain behind bars.  ”We can’t celebrate while women are raped, killed and violated like this and there’s not much to be proud of. This thing of convicted rapists and murderers still getting parole must stop. Luyanda Botha, who killed Uyinene will be out in 25 years and the man who stabbed Ramabulana 52 times. They must never get out of jail.” Nelson Mandela Foundation Luzuko Koti says:”We believe that even on issues of Gender-Based Violence that our constitution, actually, is a tool that our courts are using but also our criminal justice system must use decisively to make sure that people who are victims do not continue and permanently stay in victimhood but they become survivors.” “So since the past year of 2019 going forward, the foundation is going to focus with much more vigour on the issue of constitutionalism.” Gauteng MEC for Sports and Recreation Mbali Hlope says:” When we speak gender-based violence we know the illness that is going around and so as we celebrate today. We equally call on society to espouse what he stood for and to do their bit within their own lives to make sure that they keep this nation growing and take us to the next level.” The event wrapped up with plenty of entertainment, food, and aerobic moves on the lawns. All proceeds raised will be donated to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. Click video below:
