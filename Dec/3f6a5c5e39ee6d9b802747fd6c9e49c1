The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will continue with the fight to win all municipalities across the country during the 2021 Local Government Elections. That is according to EFF leader Julius Malema. He has told thousands of delegates who had been attending the second National People’s Assembly at Nasrec in Johannesburg, where new leaders have been elected – that groundwork must begin now for the EFF to claim victory in the polls. However, he has challenged those who are keen to be councillors to up their game and be visible in their communities. “If you want to go back to being a councillor, start tomorrow visiting communities, start working hard so that in 2021 they don’t ask who are you? We don’t want people who survive on other people’s sweat. They must come and work hard for the EFF to be in government in 2021. We want to take Johannesburg, we want to take Tshwane, we want to take PE (Port Elizabeth). ”  Malema has also warned against members who claim victory when they get elected into positions within the EFF. He says it is against the principles of the party because and it will lead to divisions within the structures of the EFF. This comes after some members of the party went to visit religious leaders thanking them for attaining leadership roles. The visibly angry Malema told delegates that he will not tolerate members who glorify positions within the party. “We shouldn’t start this organisation with wrong tendencies of thanking Bishops, of thanking Papa, thanking ancestors and slaughter white chickens. You’re personalising this organisation and you’re going to create problems. That’s why when Mandisa Mashego doesn’t get a threshold, you celebrate and stand in here like a fanatic. ”
