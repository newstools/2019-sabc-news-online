The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is seeking legal advice on what action to take following the election of ANC councilor Nonceba Molwele as the new speaker of the Johannesburg council. DA councillor Vasco Da Gama has been removed as speaker despite the DA and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councilors being absent from council. The DA had instructed all its councilors not to attend Wednesday’s council meeting because it claimed it was illegal. However two DA councilors defied this instruction. DA Gauteng chairperson Mike Moriaty says the councilors will have to answer to charges of misconduct. “These are very serious misconduct issues that played out here, so these two individuals are actually in a lot of trouble. We are taking legal advice, we are expecting a different opinion… and when that opinion comes through, we will consult and we will make a decision from there.” Meanwhile one of the DA councilors who are said to have voted with the ANC in the City of Johannesburg, Basil Douglas, says he is ready for the consequences. The revolt by these councilors in the DA has seen the metro back to an ANC mayor and speaker. Douglas says he knows that he will be treated the same way the DA treated Good Party leader, Patricia de Lille. “Let it be. Let the be consequences. We know how they operate. We know what they did to my sister Patricia de Lille.” “I knew they were coming for me. They know I came with Patricia de Lille from ID, they know I came with Patricia from PAC, I know they are coming for me. I was always prepared. Let there be consequences. If you want to be a soldier, you must be prepared to be a casualty.”
