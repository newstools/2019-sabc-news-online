Three bodies of the four people trapped at the Tau Lekoa mine shaft have been recovered. This after rescue operations are met with some challenges, due to further rock falls. Management at Tau Lekoa Gold Mine near Klerksdorp in the North West said additional support structures were installed to safeguard the rescue workers at the shaft were four miners have been trapped since Friday afternoon. A fifth miner was rescued and is being treated in hospital. The mine says a large volume of fallen rock and the threat of further rock falls are complicating rescue efforts. Five workers were trapped by a rockfall about 1 350 metres below surface of the mine shaft in Orkney near Klerksdorp. This follows two seismic events. Mine management says in a statement that one of the five miners trapped underneath has been rescued and hospitalized. The Department of Mineral Resources have since sent inspectors to the area.
