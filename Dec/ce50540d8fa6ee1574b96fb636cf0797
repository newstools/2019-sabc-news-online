National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has welcomed what she calls the historic readmission of Madagascar into the Southern African Development Community Parliamentary Forum (SADCPF). Modise says this is a relief for South Africa and will bolster efforts to strengthen unity in the region. She says Madagascar will remain an important strategic partner as South Africa has cordial bilateral relations with the Southern African island. Modise is currently leading a five-member delegation from Parliament to the SADC Parliamentary Forumâ€™s 46th Plenary Assembly Session currently under way in Swakopmund, Namibia. The six-day session, which kicked off on Wednesday, will end on Monday.
