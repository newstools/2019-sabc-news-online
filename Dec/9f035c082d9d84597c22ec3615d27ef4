The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has urged motorists to exercise extreme caution when driving in rainy conditions. The South African Weather Service has predicted heavy rains for Sunday in Gauteng, the Free State, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga. RTMC Spokesperson, Simon Zwane, says traffic volumes have increased on the country’s major roads as motorists return home after the Christmas public holidays. “Turn on the lights when driving in rainy conditions. We have seen quite a number of accidents. Single vehicles overturning and we really are concerned about the safety of our people around this time of the year and we are also urging motorists to take the responsibility and ensure they return home safely. We have seen an increase in a number of vehicles coming back from the holidays,” says Zwane. Watch a related video below:
