The father of Christopher Panayiotou was shot dead in Uitenhage in the early hours of Monday morning while apparently closing up his late-night convenience shop, the Bambi Snack Bar in Market Street in the town. His shop assistant is believed to have been kidnapped by the robbers and is still missing. According to the police, he was shot twice. Police spokesperson Sergeant Majola Nkohli confirmed that Panayiotouâ€™s VW Polo was stolen and has been recovered abandoned in Motherwell. Nkohli says more information is to be released later. Christopher orchestrated the murder of his wife Jayde Panayiotou in 2015 by hiring Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko to kill her. Her body was found in a field near Uitenhage in April 2015. She was shot three times. Panayiotou was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder. Click on the video below:
