The North West provincial Health department has attributed a high prevalence of people living with HIV in the Klerksdorp area to the influx of people from across the country, and neighbouring countries, who flocked to the area during the 1980’s seeking employment. The Dr Kenneth Kaunda District is a mining area with a population of over 690 00o. Thousands are unemployed, and many are infected with the virus. Spokesperson for the provincial Department of Health, Tebogo Lekgethwane: “Kenneth Kaunda as a mining district after Bjanala, these are our hotspots… we can also realise that is on the N12 which means we also have a lot of people coming here from other areas looking for jobs, so as a result the prevalence of HIV is very high. So we will be doing community visits to make sure we talk to the people directly.” Watch related video below:
