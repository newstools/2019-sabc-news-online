Christmas is typically a peak selling season and that special wine or bubbly usually tops most shopping lists. But with the tight economic times, South Africans will be positively cautious. Alcohol, no celebration is complete without it. It gets many into the festive spirit. Despite the strained economic climate, it’s likely to feature on most Christmas tables. George Babasakalis from Norman Goodfellows (NGF) says people’s buying patterns have changed. “Buying patterns have changed with the current economic climate. People are still buying, but they are picking what they’re buying. They’re still buying the volumes, but they are decreasing in what they are spending it on. Instead of buying an 18 year old whisky, now they’re going to a 12 and a 15. Yes, there is movement. It’s hard, it’s tough out there.” Regardless of your poison of choice….everyone is cutting back. “On the luxury goods that value from R400 000 up to R700 000 on your single malt whiskeys, your high-end cognacs; it has slowed down. Your elite are watching what they are spending so like I said before, they are all looking at what they are spending. Everyone is cautious.” For many, it will be a fine balancing act. “I think everybody is going through a little bit of economic downturn which impacts your ability to drink and spend money on expensive alcohol. So definitely we will be cutting back, but for personal health reasons it’s always a good thing to cut back a bit.” For others, costs have no bearing. “Economic climate has been rough all round. Fortunately for me, I had a really good year. I got a nice Christmas bonus so I’m buying a bit more.” Savvy shopping will also come into play. And if you’re still contemplating, some offered advice to get you into the spirit. “If we going to have a new year eve or Christmas day, let’s not have it with some water. Let’s have it with some champagne to wash away the tough times of the year.”
