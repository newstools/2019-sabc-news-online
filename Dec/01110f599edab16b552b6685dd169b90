Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Group CEO, Solly Mokoetle, was hailed as a broadcasting hero and a gallant fighter for liberation. Mokoetle was laid to rest at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg on Sunday. He died a fortnight ago after a long illness. Mokoetle joined the ANC’s Military wing Umkhonto weSizwe in the 1970s. He was instrumental in the launch of the ANC’s Radio Freedom in Angola in 1977. Back in the country in 1994, Mokoetle joined the SABC as a General Manager and participated in the transformation of the then master’s voice into a democratic public broadcaster. Former colleague Joe Mjwara praised him for his insightful contribution in liberalising the country’s airwaves. After hours of testimony on his contribution to South Africa’s liberation and the transformation of the country’s media fraternity, many believed he could have been given a better send-off befitting his stature. His former colleague at the SABC, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, has bemoaned the fact that despite having selflessly contributed in the liberation struggle and the transformation of the SABC, Mokoetle was not acknowledged and recognised by his government. Motsoeneng says Mokoetle was unfairly treated. His political home, the ANC, says a fitting tribute for Solly Mokoetle is to root out factionalism and work for unity of the organisation. Mokoetle is survived by his wife, four children and seven siblings. Watch the video below for more on the story:
