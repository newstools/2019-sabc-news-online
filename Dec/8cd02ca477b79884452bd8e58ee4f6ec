Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says he is in discussions with Ministers of neighbouring countries regarding changing the structure of the border posts, such as the Oshoek and Lebombo border-crossings. Motsoaledi has embarked on visits to various border posts as part of his department’s festive season campaign to monitor the smooth facilitation of traveler’s movement. Motsoaledi says one of the changes being discussed is that all border posts will operate for 24-hours in order to streamline the processing system.   “We are discussing a huge project which is called a one-stop border post whereby the whole infrastructure and the whole layout are going to be changed. What it means is when you move through a border post lets say the Kopfontein where I was, you will wait on the South African side, doesn’t matter how many hours you wait.  After they have processed you, you still going to wait perhaps for a similar number of hours of perhaps more on the other side, now one-stop border post is constructed and designed in such a way that the officials from both countries come and sit in one building, you get processed once then you pass.” Click on the video below:
