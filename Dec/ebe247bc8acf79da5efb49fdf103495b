Energy expert Ted Blom says a lack of clear message from government on the Eskom crisis has created panic among consumers. Consumers are raising questions about the real cause of reason Eskom escalated its load shedding to Stage 6 on Monday. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who cut short his state visit to Egypt on Tuesday, has since ordered an investigation into what he described as acts of sabotage at Eskom. The power utility has given the assurance that it will not implement load shedding from Saturday  until Monday on Reconciliation Day. Blom says South Africans are unlikely to see an end to Eskom’s problems anytime soon. “It could last for five years after the first long-term power agreements have been signed. Eskom are buying fuel from every man and his dog, they don’t have long-term contracts.”  This week, President Cyril Ramaphosa assured South Africans that there’s unlikely to be another bout of load shedding between the 17th of December until January next year – once the current power cuts end. The President met with Eskom’s board and management at Megawatt Park in Johannesburg where an emergency recovery plan was announced. The plan will look at self generation among other things.
