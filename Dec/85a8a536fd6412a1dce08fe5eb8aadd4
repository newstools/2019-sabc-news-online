Motorists will be paying less for petrol on 1 January but more for diesel. 95 Octane will cost 14 cents less while 93 Octane will drop by nine cents a litre. Diesel will increase by nine cents per litre. The Department of Energy says the fuel adjustments will take effect from the first of January 2020. In a statement, the department says the reasons for the fuel price changes are price increase of Brent Crude oil from 63 US dollars a barrel to 66 US dollars. However, the Rand appreciated during the given period against the dollar from R14. 80 to R14. 47.
