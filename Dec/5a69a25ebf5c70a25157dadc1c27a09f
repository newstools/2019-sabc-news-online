The Acting Mayor of Tshwane, Abel Tau, says they are dispatching dozens of water tankers to the far east of Pretoria – for the duration of an eight-week shortage. The City of Tshwane says residents will not experience water shortages for eight months as reported on Sunday – but rather for eight weeks. A 210-metre water supply pipeline at the Wilge Dam was damaged during the recent floods. Cullinan, Rayton, Refilwe, Petra Diamond Mine and the Zonder water prison are among the areas affected. Tau says they are working to have a temporary water system operational before Christmas. “What we are going to do as the city is to have erect water points with tanks that are filled every day so locals can go and get water. We are also trying to have a temporary pump station built in six weeks at least. We are pushing them hard to reduce that time frame. We are working around the clock and we are hopeful that we will announce good news in the next two to three weeks if all goes well. So we should be able to get water back to the people of Cullinan – my target is to say at least by Christmas.”  Click on the video below:
