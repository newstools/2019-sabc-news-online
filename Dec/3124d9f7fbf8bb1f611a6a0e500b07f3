City Power in Johannesburg says it hopes to restore power to several areas in the east of Johannesburg later on Wednesday night. Residents of Kensington, Jeppestown, Malvern, Heriodale, Denver and Benrose have been without power since Tuesday night after a fire destroyed a transformer at the Cleveland substation. “We are hoping that we will be able to restore electricity by later this evening because we have tried to find other means of ensuring that electricity is restored. You will remember that we had one transformer at Cleveland substation catching fire around midnight on Tuesday,” says City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena.
