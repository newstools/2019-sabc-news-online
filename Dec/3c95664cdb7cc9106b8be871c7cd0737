Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor, United Democratic Movementâ€™s Mongameli Bobani has been ousted in a motion of no confidence during a council meeting in Port Elizabeth. The Democratic Alliance tabled the motion in which the majority of councillors removed Bobani. This was the fourth attempt to remove him from office during his term. Earlier, Bobani has hit out at those making allegations that he is leading a corrupt coalition, saying the municipality is doing well under his leadership. Last week, two previous meetings to unseat Bobani amounted to nought as they degenerated into chaos. Click below to watch related video:
