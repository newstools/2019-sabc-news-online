Gauteng police say law enforcement agencies will continue to be visible in busy areas – such as malls and taxi ranks – amid the festive season. This after over 850 people were arrested over the weekend for various crimes across the province. Gauteng police spokesperson, Mavela Masondo, says the arrests are a result of their Safer Festive Season Operation… “This time of the year, we try and intensify our visibility. We’ve got some students from the college that have joined us so those are the students that we are also using to deploy at the malls and taxi ranks. I want to assure you that it is not something that is only happening now during the festive season. The operation will continue.”  Click on the video below:
