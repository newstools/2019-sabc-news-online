The Eastern Cape Roads and Transport Department is warning motorists travelling on the R61 between Port St Johns and Mpantu to be cautious of rock falls. Rocks continue to fall, especially in mountain passes, due to heavy rains that lashed the area this week. Department spokesperson Unathi Binqose says they are keeping an eye on the road. “We are not surprised by reports of rock falls in Port St Johns and we would like to call on motorists to be alert just about all across the province. Rains are much welcomed, but we know that with their arrival there often are troubles associated with them particularly for our motorists. That is why we are calling on them to be alert at all times particularly in mountain passes we may experience more rock falls.”
