Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan has assured South Africans that SAA is committed to remain open for business. He says there have been intense discussions with lenders in the past few days to secure the necessary funds to cover the operational and structural transition over the next few months. In a statement on Sunday night, Gordhan assured South Africans that government and the SAA management are committed to building a viable, sustainable and profitable national airline. He stresses that SAA remains open for business and has urged South Africans to support the airline in its efforts to restore sales confidence and rebuild revenues in the shortest possible time. The Minister also confirmed that restructuring was the only way to ensure the national carrier’s financial and operational sustainability going forward. He says last month’s strike by unions, NUMSA and the South African Cabin Crew Association caused immense damage to the reputation, operations, and the deterioration of the finances of SAA.
