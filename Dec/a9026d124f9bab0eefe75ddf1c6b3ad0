The South African Weather Service has issued another warning of more rain in Gauteng, which will results in more localised flooding. It says warmer and drier weather conditions are only expected towards the middle of the week. Meanwhile, at least 700 shacks have been washed away in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, after the Moretele and Hennops rivers burst their banks. Police have advised motorists to avoid Tsamaya road in the township and use alternative roads. The Tshwane Emergency Services have warned road users not attempt to cross flooded bridges and any other streams where the water has swelled above normal. Some of the Mamelodi residents say the floods have destroyed their belongings. “The thing is our people here do not listen. We have been warned that this is not a place to stay. It is dangerous but we continued to stay there and our parents are stuck here. That’s because of these floods, so if we would’ve listened. So this is a lesson so people should just move out of this area because it is not a place to stay,”says one resident. Meanwhile, Gauteng Acting Social Development MEC, Panyaza Lesufi visited some of the affected settlements in Mamelodi. “From the department of Social Development point of view we’ve unleashed all our resources in terms of food help, blankets and all other things needed for families that are in distress. We can at least carry them in the next 48 hours until the situation is under control. But we are working with the emergency services. Our call centre is receiving a lot of calls around Kagiso, Centurion. So we are trying to spread our resources.” For more watch video below:
