The N3 highway linking Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal is already experiencing high volumes of traffic as holidaymakers leave the province for various destinations. The N3 Toll Concession that manages the route says preparations have been made to deal with the high traffic volumes. N3 Toll Concession Manager, Praveen Sunderlall has urged motorists to be extra cautious on the roads. “What we want to do is to encourage everyone to obey the rules of the road. It’s a caution to all motorists that we have and enhanced the enforcement activities on the route. So, you will be stopped. You will be prosecuted. You will be dealt with if there are any infringements that have been caused by yourself. So, what we want to encourage motorists to do is to share the road responsibly. And also take responsibility for yourself and also for passengers. Keep to the rules of the road and ensure that you get to your destination safely as well,” says Sunderlall. Police are on high alert across the country as holidaymakers continue to head to their destinations for the festive season. Authorities have warned that they’ll be out in full force to curb lawlessness on the roads. Holidaymakers have also raised their concerns. “We don’t feel safe driving to Eastern Cape from Gauteng because people are speeding and in a hurry to get to their destinations,” says one. “In terms of safety on the road, we are not so safe because Moloto road is full of potholes. I do not trust our public transport. I think they should improve in servicing the cars on time so that we can be safe on the roads,” says another road user. A bus driver says his vehicle is in good condition to transport passengers safely to Zimbabwe. “I am 100% ready for the trip. I had a good rest. My bus is in good condition. And I have done my pre-trip inspection and ready for the trip.” Watch a related video below :
