Police say they are going through CCTV footage of the killing of former gang leader Rashied Staggie, as the manhunt for his killers continues. Staggie was gunned down while sitting in a car outside his family home on London Road in Salt River, in Cape Town, on Friday. His twin brother Rashaad was also killed on the same road in 1996 by the members of the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad). Western Cape Community Safety Minister Albert Fritz has condemned the shooting and also called for calm following the incident. Police say their forensic teams and detectives are still busy with investigations. They say there have no records of the shooting of Staggie’s son in Mictchell’s Plain, on the Cape Flats. The Staggie family had claimed he was also killed on Friday. Watch related video below:
