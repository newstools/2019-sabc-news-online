Liphoko says, “I cannot say we trust this new mayor but the only thing we can say it that as a mayor if he is willing to work with then I think there will be progress but if he is not willing there will be no progress at all.” The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State says it welcomes the election of Koalane.
