The City of Johannesburg will send engineers to assess the damage at the M1 south bridge at the Booysens off-ramp, south of Johannesburg, after it partially collapsed on Christmas Day.  Johannesburg Metro Police Spokesperson Xolani Fihla has confirmed that the safety of the bridge has been compromised, but says it remains open to traffic.  Fihla says police are monitoring the situation.  “Johannesburg Roads Agency had been contacted to come and assess the damage and if necessary to go-ahead to close the section of the bridge.” Click on the video below:
