Metrorail says its investigation into the recent train fires at Cape Town Station is progressing well. This after 18 train carriages were destroyed in a fire at the station almost two weeks ago. The estimated cost of the damage is around R60 million. Metrorail has since issued a reward of R100 000 to anyone who has information regarding the investigation, which can lead to a successful conviction. “We encourage more individuals and communities to do their civic duty and come forward with any information, either about the incident or about the persons of interest. Ultimately, South African taxpayers will have to foot the bill to replace these trains and it really is economic sabotage as Minister Fikile Mbalula said at the time of the briefing. 18 carriages destroyed, worth R61 million. Just think what that money could have done to improve the service,” says Riana Scott, Metrorail Spokesperson.
