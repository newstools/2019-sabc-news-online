The South Africa Weather Service says the western and southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal are expected to have isolated thunderstorms on Saturday. The weather services have also issued a warning for Gale force winds over the coastal areas between Margate and Richards Bay throughout the afternoon. Over the past week, KwaZulu Natal has seen heavy rains which have led to localised flooding in parts of the province. Forecaster Wisani Maluleke says the province can expect isolated showers and rain with strong winds along the coast. Maluleke says, “Over KwaZulu-Natal, we expect isolated thunderstorm activities over the western half of the province and the southern part of the province, from your Ladysmith, Newcastle areas,  Giants Castle and Kokburg.” “We also have a watch for the coastal areas, with strong damaging winds along the coast reaching up to 35 to 40 North just between Margate and Richards Bay this afternoon,” says Maluleke.
