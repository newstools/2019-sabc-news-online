The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says the weapons that were stolen at the Lyttelton SANDF military base in Pretoria have not been found. This is contrary to earlier reports quoting the National Defence Union Secretary, Pikkie Greef, that the weapons have been found near Hammanskraal, a day after they were stolen. SANDF Spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini confirmed that the stolen weapons have not been found. He says the suspects will appear at the Military Court at Thaba Tshwane in Pretoria on Friday. Dlamini would not confirm how many suspects will be appearing in the military court, saying that he does not know. Earlier reports stated that four officers had been arrested and 19 guards were taken in for questioning. Dlamini also says all the military bases of the SANDF are guarded by their own members. Earlier this week the Democratic Alliance (DA) accused the SANDF of letting South Africans down during a time of peace and goodwill after allowing the perpetrators to enter the military base and getting away with the automatic rifles manufactured for extreme warfare.
