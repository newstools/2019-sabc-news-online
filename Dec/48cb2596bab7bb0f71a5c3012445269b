The Nelson Mandela Remembrance Run and Walk in Pretoria has sent a strong message against women and children abuse. The event was held in honour of late former president Nelson Mandela and his commitment to South Africa.  Over 20 000 people braved the early morning wet weather conditions to take part in the 21 & 5 km walk and run.  Nelson Mandela’s granddaughter Ndileka says such events help to communicate important messages to the community.  She challenged men to be part of the fight against women and children abuse. “Let us declare that war back by arming ourselves with how we recognise the signs of emotional abuse, first. Arm ourselves in terms of equipping ourselves in self-defence and if men love us they will help us to do that. They call us “our women”, they must teach their daughters, their nieces, their wives, their sisters, and their aunt’s self-defence. They must teach them how to recognise signs of emotional abuse because as women we are under siege.” The Mandela Remembrance Walk and Run is taking place in Pretoria – both starting and finishing at the Union Buildings, with a choice of running or walking for five, ten, or twenty-one kilometers.
