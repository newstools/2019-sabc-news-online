Nearly 2 000 motorists have been arrested across the country for various offences over the long weekend. Traffic officers were out in full force in an attempt to get motorists to comply with the rules of the roads and reduce accidents. Road Traffic Management spokesperson for the Corporation Simon Zwane says, “Many of the people have been arrested for speeding, drunken driving, some had outstanding traffic fines and some were overloading and others driving without licenses.” Zwane says there are no minimum sentences for these violations at the moment. “There are no minimum sentences at the moment, that is what we have been engaging with the department of justice about, that there should be minimum sentencing.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/792479">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
