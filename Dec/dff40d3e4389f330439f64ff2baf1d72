A single-vehicle crash was reported between Tugela Plaza and Durban. Spokesperson Con Roux says they are hoping that traffic volumes will decrease. “Considering the traffic volumes, we are happy that we only had one incident. Traffic volumes were very high throughout the day; they have started now to take the rock. As people make down Mooi Plaza and Mariannhill toll plaza towards Durban. We are expecting later this afternoon by those evening traffic volumes will have returned to normal.” Collisions ER 24 says 29 people were injured when a taxi rolled near Richmond in KwaZulu-Natal.

We use those routes and we’re coming from North West working with mine people; so we have difficulties in transporting miners back home.”
