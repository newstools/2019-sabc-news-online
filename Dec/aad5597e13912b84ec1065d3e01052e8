A woman, who allegedly killed her son and two of his friends with poison, is expected to appear in the Aliwal North Magistrate’s Court, in the Eastern Cape, on Tuesday. She faces three counts of murder. The trio, aged 19, 25 and 27, was at first believed to have taken their own lives by ingesting poison. An investigation later revealed that they had shared some porridge and became very sick. The 63-year-old suspect is reported to have confessed to the police that she gave her son the food mixed with poison, never anticipating that he would share it with his friends. Police Spokesperson Moitheri Bojabotseha says the woman told police that her son was a drug addict and abusive towards her. She poisoned him because she couldn’t handle the abuse anymore.
