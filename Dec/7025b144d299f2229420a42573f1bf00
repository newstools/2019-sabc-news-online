Political parties in Parliament have also reacted to South African Airways (SAA) being placed under business rescue. Some believe the decision to place SAA in business rescue is long overdue. Others say the national carrier’s wings must be clipped, once and for all. Despite political differences, there is consensus among political parties that SAA must not be given further bailouts. They also want the business rescue practitioner to have free reign. Democratic Alliance’s spokesperson on Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Alf Lees says the business rescue practitioner must be given the full freedom to take whatever steps are required to try and save the airline. Watch the video for more on the story:  United Democratic Movement Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa says; “ We are going to scrutinise the credentials of the person who is going to be put as a practitioner to oversee the restructuring of SAA because it entails everything, the assets, the debt portfolio of SAA, to see whether or not that business can be rescued.” Some say as the shareholder, government, had no choice but to take drastic action. African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) Chief Whip Steve Swart says there is no other option and therefore it is necessary to place SAA under business rescue with a practitioner. Inkatha Freedom Party Member of Parliament Inkosi Mzamo Buthelezi says government cannot afford to keep rescuing SAA.  “We’ve been also saying that we cannot keep on putting money into this state owned entity.” The African Independent Congress believes there are no reasonable prospects that SAA would bounce back. “We don’t think it’s going to make any difference and that will be another deepening of corruption because that practitioner who will take over, we don’t know what he will do,” says the party’s Deputy President Lulama Ntshayisa. The Public Enterprises Committee Chairperson declined to comment, saying he is awaiting the minister’s briefing.
