Western Cape Agriculture Minister, Ivan Meyer, has called on all retail companies who benefited from Black Friday sales to support farm owners and farm workers. The severe drought in many parts of the country has devastated farmers with livestock dying and many farmers having to rely on relief aid to support their families. Meyer is urging businesses to support the local drought initiatives. “Black Friday gave business and retailers a massive financial boost and huge profits. We are still experiencing a severe drought throughout South Africa. Because of this, with your help, we can prevent a black Christmas for our farmers and our farm workers.”
