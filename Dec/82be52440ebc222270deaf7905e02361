The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has seized containers from Mozambique of illegal medicines worth R 5 million. The shipments was seized after an investigation by SAHPRA found containers with tablets and powder which reportedly contain paracetamol. SAHPRA spokesperson Yuven Gounden say preliminary investigations show that the medicines are not South African products. “The shipment had no papers, so no one knew where it came from and where it was going to. When we questioned the driver, he said it was going to a certain organisation. When the police contacted the organisation they knew nothing about the shipment. So we had to seize that shipment…” “We’ve done one quick examination of it, and so far it tells that it contains paracetamol. We are not sure if that is paracetamol but definitely it’s not South African product. It was not supposed to be in this country,” added Gounden.
