Business rescue practitioner Les Matuson says there is a reasonable chance that South African Airways (SAA) can be saved. Matuson has been roped in to try and pull the state-run carrier back from the brink of collapse. His team contends that rescuing SAA would be a better outcome for all stakeholders than a liquidation. Matuson says in an event of liquidation of SAA, proceeds would all go to certain creditors at the expense of others. If the national carrier shuts down about 10 000 employees stand to lose their jobs. The government handed SAA another R4 billion at around the same time that Matuson was appointed as a business rescue practitioner.
