The African National Congress (ANC) in Tshwane has criticised the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) high court application to stop the removal of mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and speaker Katlego Mathebe, as ‘being all over the place’. The application was postponed to Thursday. This was to allow the ANC to study documents of an additional application by Mokgalapa, acting mayor Abel Tau, Speaker Katlego Mathebe and councillor Zweli Khumalo to join the proceedings. The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs in the ANC controlled province had earlier presided over a council meeting and resolved to allow the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the ANC to nominate EFF councillor Obakeng Ramabodu to act in the speaker’s role. However, the court temporarily set aside that resolution. ANC Tshwane regional chairperson Kgoshi Maepa says: “We are not against submission of any papers if the judge so allows. What we did is that we took those papers. Our lawyers said they will respond to the papers tomorrow. We will file a responding affidavit. I will do the affidavit myself as the first founding affidavit I’ve done. The case of the DA is all over the show.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
