The Free State executive council will on Thursday table the letter which Deputy Finance Minister, David Masondo has written to Premier, Sisi Ntombela calling for the Mangaung Metro to be placed under administration. Ntombela has confirmed receiving the leaked letter in which Masondo says the metro’s failure to implement the existing Voluntary Financial Plan has prompted the decision. The metro, which includes Bloemfontein, has been struggling to deliver basic services. In a leaked letter, Masondo says the city’s financial records show underspending of conditional grants, yet the funds are not in the bank account and that the National Treasury has also made efforts to get response from Mangaung regarding the defaults that led to Moody’s Ratings Agency’s downgrade, but the Metro has failed to react. For some time, opposition parties in Mangaung have been calling for the Metro to be placed under administration, citing poor service delivery. The African National Congress (ANC) in Mangaung then blamed executive mayor, Olly Mlamleli, for the dire state of Metro, and demanded her axing. Click below to watch related video:
