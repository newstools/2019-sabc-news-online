Prime Minister Boris Johnson won initial approval for his Brexit legislation on Friday , the first step towards fulfilling his election pledge to deliver Britainâ€™s departure from the European Union by January 31. Lawmakers voted 358 versus 234 in favour of the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the legislation required to ratify the exit deal with Brussels. The remaining parliamentary stages will be completed in January. The final stages of ratification will take place after Christmas, with the lower house of parliament having until January 9 to approve the legislation, or Withdrawal Agreement Bill, giving it just over three weeks to then pass through the upper house and receive Royal Assent.
