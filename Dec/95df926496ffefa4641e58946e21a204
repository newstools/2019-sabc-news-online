Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) in KwaZulu-Natal wants all municipalities that have failed to deliver services to the people to be held accountable. Cogta Chairperson Ricardo Mthembu will be leading a portfolio committee to the Umkhanyakude District on the north coast of the province, which has been dogged by water shortages and a lack of service delivery. Mthembu says they will engage with residents to find out about service delivery. He says, “We are going to be taking on the municipality in terms of their plans, if they do have a plan and what has made it not successful. People are still complaining about not getting water where they live. We are going to be looking at and see whether they need us…” “We want to know exactly why the municipality is not satisfying communities as they are expected and we will have a lengthy discussion with all stakeholders,” added Mthembu. Recently the Auditor-General raised concerns about the lack of compliance in various municipalities around KZN.
