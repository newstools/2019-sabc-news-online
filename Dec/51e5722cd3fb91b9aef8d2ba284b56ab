President Cyril Ramaphosa in his letter from the President’s Desk has focused on the need to make reconciliation a practical undertaking. Writing just ahead of the Reconciliation Month celebrations taking place today in Bergville, KwaZulu-Natal, Ramaphosa has said that while racism and bigotry no longer define South Africa and social cohesion has grown, true reconciliation requires political and economic transformation. Ramaphosa says the country has much to be proud of with regards to building unity – citing the joy across the racial divide at the Springboks World Cup win and Miss South Africa’s Miss Universe victory. He however says that the country must go further to close the inequality that continues to exist as a result of centuries of discrimination. Ramaphosa insists that this requires forging ahead with land reform and social development as well as the National Health Insurance, and improving the country’s quality of education. It also calls for the unlocking of investment and promoting growth to restructure the economy to benefit all.
