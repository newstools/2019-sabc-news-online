 Eskom says no load shedding is on the cards for Christmas Day but could be implemented at short notice. The power utility says the system is still vulnerable and unpredictable however there is a drop in demand during the holiday period. Spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says technical teams are working around the clock to limit the impact of unplanned breakdowns at its power stations going into the new year. “The system does remain quite constrained. You would have seen that our unplanned breakdowns are still quite high today. But the technical teams continue to do the work; they are working around the clock to make sure that come next year, those unplanned breakdowns are below 9 500 megawatts to enable us to minimise the possibility of load shedding. We’re not using our emergency diesel reserves at this point.” The power utility will continue to use emergency reserves to supplement capacity if necessary over this period. Eskom says the possibility of load shedding remains and is pleading with South Africans to use electricity sparingly as the system remains vulnerable and unpredictable.    Eskom to conduct audits in Soweto Eskom has expressed concern over the safety of its technicians going into Soweto to conduct audits. The power utility says before it can repair a power station or reconnect a community after a power trip, an audit must be conducted. Eskom says it is receiving backlash from communities fearing being cut off as they may have illegally connected their electricity.
