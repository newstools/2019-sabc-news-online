The South African Weather Services says severe thunderstorms are expected in some parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday. The weather service says the storms are expected to hit Umzimkhulu, and the lower midland areas with possible hail and strong winds. Weather Forecaster, Stacey Cowen says, “There is some thunderstorm activity at the moment, just south of Pietermaritzbug, as well as south of Greytown, at the moment, which are severe but are dissipating for now. Looking ahead to tomorrow, we don’t have any warnings in KZN, but it will be a cloudy day, especially along the coast and adjacent interior, otherwise partly clouded over most of the province with some isolated scattered showers and thunder showers in the afternoon.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
