Disgruntled medical doctors who are on community service and other health workers in Limpopo have embarked on a protest march to the offices of the provincial Health Department. The health workers have accused the department of unfairly terminating their contracts. They demand to be retained as employees across public health facilities. The health workers handed a memorandum of grievances to Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba. Representative of the group Collen Mulaudzi says they have specific demands. “We demand posts for all community service workers willing to serve the Limpopo province. Number two, retention of other health care professionals. We understand that all other health care officials, nurses, allied health, oral health and others are faced with the same sword. ”
