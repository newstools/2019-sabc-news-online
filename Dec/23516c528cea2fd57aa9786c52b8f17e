Some people who harvest Mopane worms in the Giyani area in Limpopo say the recent heatwave has a negative impact on the availability of the worms. Scores of locals from various villages, including Makhuva, outside Giyani, harvest Mopane worms for either cash in or eat with their families. They say have not been able to harvest enough because the worms are dying due to heatwave. People use their festive season holidays to harvest Mopane worms along the road between Giyani and Phalaborwa. “We did not get them just because the sun is very hot, so they are dead. They can’t survive when there’s no rain,” says one distraught villager. Aram Maluleke is among those who harvest Mopane worms for cash in. He sells along the road at Nsavulani village. “It is important to eat Mopane worms. It has protein because the worms only eat leaves from trees.” Traditionally the worms were harvested for subsistence but harvesting has become more commercially driven.
