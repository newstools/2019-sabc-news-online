The Automobile Association says the start of the new year could bring good news for motorists with a possible decrease in the petrol price of around 17 cents a litre. This is based on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. The AA says the rand has held steady against the US dollar which could contribute to a further price drop if this trend continues. The AA’s Layton Beard explains, “At this stage, our forecast is that we are going to be seeing around about 17 cents a litre drop in the price of petrol in January. A one cent increase to the price of diesel and around four cent decrease for illuminating paraffin. It is still early in the month and the picture may change before the end of December going into January. For now, it appears that at least we will be seeing a decrease in the price of petrol in the new year.”
