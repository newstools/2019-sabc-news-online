The Democratic Alliance (DA) has not ruled out going to court to try and stop Wednesday’s Joburg council meeting that has been called to elect the new speaker. The DA is adamant that its councillor Vasco da Gama is still the speaker of council. It says the African National Congress’s (ANC) motion of no confidence in the speaker failed last Thursday because the party did not have the majority which is required for the motion to succeed. However, the ANC says of the 264 councillors present at the meeting, 135 of them voted for Da Gama’s removal whereas 99 voted against and that all the 30 EFF councillors abstained. Joburg City manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni has called a special council meeting on Wednesday. ” We are writing to the city manager and asking him on what basis did he call the meeting when the speaker is still in office. We will take the legal advice from our legal team but the option of an interdict is definitely one of them,” but the DA’s Funzela Ngobeni says they will challenge.
