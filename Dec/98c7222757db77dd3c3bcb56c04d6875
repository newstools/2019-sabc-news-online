Good flow of traffic along N3 Toll Route from Cedara interchange 96 to Heidelberg interchange 59, and there are currently no reported incidents – that’s according to N3 Toll Concession traffic. It says levels are expected to remain low on Thursday as well as Friday. “Very glad to say that for motorists out there on the roads today (Thursday) and tomorrow (Friday), it looks very quiet and a number of people have commented on our twitter feed at N3 route saying how pleasant it’s been travelling outside of peak traffic, so all good at the moment and no incidents to report and good weather conditions,” says Con Roux,  N3 Toll Concession spokesperson. On Monday and Tuesday, high traffic volumes were recorded as thousands of holidaymakers made their way to coastal areas.
