Eskom says it will continue to work with law enforcement agencies, including the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and the Hawks, to root out corruption at the power utility. This follows the arrest of two of Eskom’s former senior managers, Abram Masango and France Hlakudi respectively. They were arrested in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng alongside two business directors and representatives of seven companies earlier on Thursday. They all appeared in the Johannesburg Regional Court on Thursday afternoon on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering involving R745-million. Meanwhile, the SIU has welcomed the arrest of the two former senior managers. Spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says they’ve been conducting investigations since last year. “We really contributed a lot as SIU to make sure that we refer the matter to the NPA about these matters. Among which are those of the criminality that was happening between some of the sub-contractors at Kusile and other companies that are involved in that together with these senior managers that were working for Eskom at the time. So for us it is a great achievement,” explains Kganyago.
