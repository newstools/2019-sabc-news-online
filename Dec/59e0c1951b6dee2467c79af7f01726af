National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise says she is seeking legal advice and studying an affidavit that has been sent to her about Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. A staff member who is a whistleblower invoked the Protected Disclosures Act to make damning allegations against Mkhwebane. Media reports say that the affidavit reveals how Mkhwebane allegedly instructed that information implicating former Free State Premier, Ace Magashule and Mosebenzi Zwane should be removed from her report on the Estina Dairy farm project in Vrede. Modise has conceded that the matter is serious. “Yes I did. I have received the letter. I have actually gone through the affidavit that is protected. We are taking legal advice in the matter. And as soon as we have that legal advice, we will know which way Parliament must go. We think the matter is very serious and that it cannot just be allowed to float away,” says Modise.
