A total 489 fatal crashes have claimed nearly 600 lives on the country’s roads so far this festive season. Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula released the mid festive season road death toll at the Beit Bridge border post in Musina, in Limpopo on Monday. KwaZulu-Natal recorded the highest death toll with 135. It’s followed by:
• Gauteng with 95 deaths,
• Eastern Cape with 81,
• Limpopo with 73,
• Free State with 56,
• Western Cape with 54,
• Mpumalanga had 40,
• North West 36 and
• Northern Cape with the lowest at 16. Mbalula says he is concerned about the high number of drunken drivers. 1397 drivers have been arrested for drunk driving. 2915 have been arrested since the start of the festive road safety campaign, that’s 137 less than last year. He says over 200 000 traffic fines have been issued thus far. “The success we have recorded so far should not lead us to complacency. Our job is not yet done. We must continue to implement our intervention with greater intensity. A busy period lies ahead as holidaymakers continue to make their way to holiday destinations and festivities during Christmas and new year long weekends,” says Mbalula. Mbalula says the law enforcement officers must not allow lawlessness. “It is a worrying factor that we have been saying to the authority all the time. As you can see the vehicles that come from Zim to SA empty … there is no problem with Zimbabweans coming to boom our economy in the country, but we must maintain the rule of our law and stamp our authority in relation to our borders. The most important thing is the safety of our people and at the same time, ensuring that our roads are safe. Unroadworthy vehicles, we take them out.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
