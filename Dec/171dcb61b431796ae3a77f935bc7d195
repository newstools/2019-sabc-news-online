Hundreds of firecrackers have been confiscated following a blitz by law enforcement authorities in Johannesburg. Police and Joburg Emergency Services officials raided a number of shops that sell firecrackers in the Joburg CBD to check for compliance with the city’s by-laws as it relates to the selling and storing of firecrackers. Out of the 25 outlets targeted, 11 were found not to be compliant and were issued with fines ranging between R1500 to R2500. Joburg Emergency Services Spokesperson, Nana Radebe, has appealed for the responsible discharging of fireworks. “We have also found a number of people that were selling on roads and did not know that it is illegal to sell fireworks. We are still urging communities to be very careful around petrol stations and those that have pets and animals around, please do take care of them. Please make sure there are adults around when kids do fireworks,” says Radebe.  Watch a related video below:
