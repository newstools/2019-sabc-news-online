Power has been restored to more than 5 000 customers in the Dipaliseng municipality in Mpumalanga after they were without power since the weekend. The substation, which is a distribution unit, was struck by lightning, affecting three transformers. Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae earlier said that one of the transformers burnt out completely and had to be replaced while the other two had to be shut down as a safety measure.
