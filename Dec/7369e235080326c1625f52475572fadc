Traffic authorities are on high alert on the country’s major routes ahead of the Christmas celebrations. Traffic volumes heading into KwaZulu-Natal are expected to peak at the various toll routes as holidaymakers make their way to the province. KZN Metro Police Spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersad says the provincial joint traffic operation centre, in partnership with the national roads agency SANRAL, will be monitoring the roads closely. “We are monitoring the CCTV cameras coming into the city so we are at a watchful eye of everything. Also on the hotspot areas we are monitoring the roads and beaches through the eye in the sky – through an RTI chopper that has been made available to us. We can expect an exodus of people coming through the tolls. We are also monitoring the tolls from JHB all the way to Marianhill. We are also monitoring the Tongaat Toll and the toll on the south coast.” Motorists are being urged to obey the rules of the road. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala and Community Safety and Liaison MEC Bheki Ntuli conducted stop and search operations at the Marrianhill Toll Plaza. “This is part of our integrated law enforcement plan which is going to take place throughout the festive season and throughout KwaZulu-Natal. Right now, cars that are going to Durban are around 2 100 per two hours or so since this morning.” Meanwhile, traffic authorities say they are also expecting an increased flow of traffic on the N1 in Limpopo.
