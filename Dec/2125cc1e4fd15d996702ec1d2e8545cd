Former Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has come out strongly against racial politics in South Africa. Maimane was speaking to SABC News when he denied planning to form a new political party and says he is instead working on a civil society organization that will hold politicians to account. Maimane quit the DA after Helen Zille was elected chairperson of the party’s federal council. He says diversity is an important issue in South Africa. “I didn’t go out to say what was white must now be black. I went out to say I wanted to build a diverse organisation that’s why I worked hard to diversify the benches in Parliament, that’s why I worked hard that in all the events that we did that’s what we sought to do. Still to this day, I don’t think that the war that’s being waged in our politics should be black parties versus white parties, that’s regressive when you want to say you want an organisation to be transformed. It should be a fight that’s fought by black and white people.”
