President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be no leave for key Eskom staff members until January, to ensure that South Africans have no load shedding on Christmas Day. He addressed a media conference at Megawatt Park in Johannesburg, following his meeting with Cabinet ministers and the Eskom board on what led to the latest bout of severe load shedding. President Ramaphosa says Eskom’s board has promised to stabilise the national grid to avoid more load shedding during the festive season. “We also felt that there needed to be more accountability at the management level. I have instructed all managers and executives that all leave is cancelled. No one is going on leave from now until January. All key managers must remain to ensure that we have no load shedding.” Watch the video for more on the story:
