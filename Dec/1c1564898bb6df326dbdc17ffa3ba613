Police forensic experts are on the scene of an incident in which former leader of the notorious Hard Livings gang, Rashied Staggie was shot and killed in Salt River, Western Cape, on Friday morning. He was shot while sitting in a car outside his house in London street. In 1996, vigilante group, Pagad, shot and set alight Staggie’s twin brother, Rashaad in the same street. Provincial police spokesperson Novella Potelwa says Staggie died upon arrival at a nearby hospital. “The 58 year old died on arrival at a nearby hospital. Information at the disposal of the police indicates that the deceased was sitting in his vehicle when two unknown suspects emerged, fired several shots at him and fled on foot. Crime scene experts are currently on the scene combing for clues that could assist the murder investigation. Woodstock police have reinforced deployment in and around the Salt River area.”  ‘Family too emotional’ Family members have started to gather at the home of Rashied Staggie in Salt River. A large media contingent has also gathered in London street in Salt River where Staggie was shot and killed. Staggie was sitting in a vehicle in front of his house on Friday morning when two suspects fired several shots at him through the windscreen. A relative says the family is too emotional to speak to the media. In 2004, Staggie was convicted of burglary from the Faure police armoury and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was released on parole nine years later. Staggie and his twin brother Rashaad were notorious gang leaders in the 1990’s. Rashaad died in 1996 when he was shot and set alight by Pagad in the same street where Friday morning’s killing took place.
