The Water and Sanitation Department says the current rainfall has had no impact on the dam levels – and some continue to decline. The Department says if the rainfall persists for longer, then it could result in improvement in dam levels. This however is not good news, as the South African Weather Service anticipates the rainfall will start subsiding from Wednesday. The Department’s spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says dam levels have continued to decline. “The Vaal Dam, for instance, has continued to decline over the last two days… it is now standing at about 39% – whereas last week this time it was about 42%. It gives you a picture of where things are. We are expecting some rains in the catchments in Mpumalanga and Ermelo, we believe that would be able to assist us, but it won’t be immediate as the water will take a couple of days before it comes into the system.”     Meanwhile on Monday, at least 700 shacks were washed away in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, after the Moretele and Hennops rivers burst their banks.   Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and her Gauteng counterpart Lebogang Maile are expected to visit the area today to assess the situation for government intervention.
