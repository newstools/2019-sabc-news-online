The Democratic Alliance (DA) is reviving its request to the Speaker of the National Assembly to have the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, removed from office. The party had started this process in the fifth Parliament, and again after the general elections earlier this year. However, it was found that Parliament did not have rules in place for the removal of a head of a Chapter Nine institution. This week, the National Assembly adopted new rules for this purpose. Among others, the rules entail the appointment of a panel which may consist of a judge, to determine prima facie evidence before MPs will investigate the matter. The DA chief whip, Natasha Mazzone, says they are re-submitting their request. “I have today written to the speaker asking her to initiate according to the new rules of parliament, the process for the removal of Adv Mkwebane, the Public Protector, in accordance with new rules of Parliament.”
