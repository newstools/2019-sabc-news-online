One hundred and seventy three people have been killed on the roads of KwaZulu-Natal since the beginning of the festive season. Traffic volumes heading to Durban increased significantly since Friday with close to 2 000 vehicles passing through the Mariannhill Toll Plaza hourly. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the death toll is 7% lower compared with the corresponding period last year. “Even when we talk (about safe driving) some people continue (to drive reckless on the roads). This thing of taking things for granted is a problem because people think that they can drink and drive. We are here (to make sure that motorists obey the rule of the road) and we are going to be all over. Nobody is going to drink and drive,” explains Zikalala. Watch related video below for more:
