The family of former Hard Livings gang leader Rashied Staggie is still trying to come to terms with his death. Staggie was shot while sitting in a car outside his family home in Cape Town this morning. He succumbed to his injuries in hospital. “There is quite a lot of family coming in and out, that are in great bereavement and sorrow, media will say another gangster, but he was somebody’s brother, husband and family but unfortunately we live at a time where nobody cares for each other as they should,” says Staggie’s younger brother, Solomon. He says although there’s rumours that his brother’s death could be gang-related, his family won’t be seeking revenge. Western Cape Community Safety Ministry Spokesperson Cayla Murray says police are on high alert following the murder, while police say they are following several leads after two suspects were seen leaving the shooting scene. Staggie and his late twin brother Rashaad were notorious gang leaders in the 90s. The People Against Gangsterism and Drugs protesters gunned down and set alight Rashaad in 1996 at the same street where Staggie came under a hail of bullets today. Watch related video:
