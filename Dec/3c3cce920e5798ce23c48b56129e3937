The High Court in Pretoria has dismissed Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane‘s application for leave to appeal the case of the Estina dairy farm project in Vrede in the Free State. Earlier this year Mkhwebane’s report on the project was set aside and declared unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid. She was also ordered to personally pay for the cost of the application that the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution had brought. The DA questioned why there was no effort made to probe the true corruption at the heart of the scandal and to hold those responsible to account. Former Free State premier Ace Magashule and former Agriculture MEC Mosebenzi Zwane have been implicated in the scandal. WATCH BELOW:
