President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent a message of hope for 2020 – saying 2019 has been a year of several highs and lows.  In his New Year message to the nation, Ramaphosa says despite the setbacks of 2019, South Africans should work together to build a better country… “Fellow South Africans, as the 25th year of our democracy draws to a close, we look back on a year that has been filled with both highs and lows, a year in which we measured great progress, but also encountered several setbacks. Just as the strongest steel is forged in fire, just as diamonds are forged deep inside the earth’s crust under the most extreme pressure, let us turn adversity into opportunity. By working together towards the South Africa that we all want, sparing neither strength nor courage, we will progress and we will succeed.” Ramaphosa has also raised concerns over the unemployment rate in the country – saying more needs to be done in 2020 to lift the poor out of poverty. He says while South Africans continue to live in a robust and vibrant democracy, more lives need to change for the better… “In May millions of South Africans went to cast their votes, peacefully and enthusiastically, This once again demonstrated for all the world to see that we are a robust and vibrant democracy. Yet, for many South Africans, the hardships endured. While our economy created jobs, these have not been nearly enough to stop the rise in unemployment or the deepening of poverty. Many South Africans’ lives have changed for the better, but many others are yet to feel the benefits of the economic reforms and new investment.”
