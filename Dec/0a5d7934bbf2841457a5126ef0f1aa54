The Klipspruit Valley Road in Orlando West, Soweto, has been closed off to traffic due to flooding. Motorists are advised to avoid the area as it continues to rain in Gauteng and other parts of the country. “Motorists are advised to avoid that road for now and can use Chris Hani Road or alternatively drive through the back on Elias Motsoaledi or drive through Meadowlands, but they should avoid Klipsruit Valley Road this (Wednesday) afternoon because it is flooded,” says Johannesburg Metro Police Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar.(K)
