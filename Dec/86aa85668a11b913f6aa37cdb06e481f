Economics Freedom Fighters (EFF) President Julius Malema has committed his party to the establishment of a private school to serve the poor. In his closing address at the EFF National People’s Assembly in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg, Malema made a commitment that the school will be established within the next five years. Malema was re-elected as the leader of the EFF – Pic by Dinilohlanga Mekuto “If we do not build the school in the next five years do not re-elect us.” He says the school should be situated in a poor community, singling out Alexandra as a potential site for the school. He says having spent R32m on a four-day conference, it is possible to accomplish this dream of building a private school that will offer decolonised education for the poor. EFF delegates in a jovial mood – Pic by Dinilohlanga Mekuto Malema stressed the importance of recognising Africans in the school curricular. “We want decolonised education taught by people who look like us, not people who look different. We must find ourselves there, everything African must be taught there. African philosophers must be celebrated. We must build a private school owned by the EFF.” In his address, he took a swipe at businessmen Patrice Motsepe and Sisa Ngebulana asking why they do not have private schools. Malema also addressed the issue of GBV, blaming churches and religion for encouraging the discrimination of women. The EFF’s People’s Assembly concluded today – Pic by Dinilohlanga Mekuto “There are no holy cows here, everywhere women are discriminated against. We must take the war there,” suggesting that religions aid in oppressing women. Malema was re-elected unopposed as EFF president for the second term. The four day conference ends on Monday.
