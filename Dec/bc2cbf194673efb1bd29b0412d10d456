Pastor Ivan Waldeck has told mourners at a memorial service in Manenberg on the Cape Flats that Rashied Staggie was a changed man. The former gang leader was gunned down outside his home in Salt River more than a week ago. Residents of Manenberg gathered at a local sports field as part of a funeral service for Staggie. Manenberg is the stronghold of the gang which the Staggie twins formed in the 1970s. Waldeck says Staggie changed his ways and other people could also be persuaded to make a new start. “I do call upon the church and religious leaders to take hands and stop preaching a lot in the buildings come among those who need it in Manenberg, Hanover Park, Lavender Hill and preach the power of the gospel who saved and change people like Rashied.”
