The National Assembly has passed a resolution with more than 200 votes in favour of Kholeka Gcaleka to be appointed as Deputy Public Protector. Earlier, the Assembly considered the Justice and Correctional Services Committee report recommending Gcaleka’s appointment. Gcaleka is a former legal advisor of former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. She was one of the seven candidates who were shortlisted by the Justice and Correctional Services Committee for the position.  The term of office of the outgoing Deputy Kevin Malunga comes to an end on Monday, 9 December. “Honourable members the outcome of the division is as follows: No abstentions, 103 voted against, 203 voted in favour and the vote is thus agreed to. Honourable members, the majority of members in the House in total 203 have voted in support of the nomination. As the required majority has been obtained in terms of section 29(A) of the Public Protector Act, the nomination has been approved. The name of the person recommended for the appointment will be forwarded to the President,” said National Assembly House Chairperson Cedric Frolick reading the results.
