United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader, Bantu Holomisa, has described as unsurprising – the removal of Mongameli Bobani as the Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor. He was removed through a motion of no confidence on Thursday morning. The African National Congress (ANC) voted in favour of a Democratic Alliance (DA) motion, while the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  abstained. The Hawks had, earlier this year, investigated Bobani on allegations of tender fraud and corruption, which he refuted. Holomisa has reiterated his stance, that Bobani was ousted due to his refusal to approve favours for politicians from other political parties. “We are not angry at all. This didn’t come as a surprise to us. What was the motive of those who wanted him out, given that he himself has named the people who have approached him to give favours? He is a good person because we demanded the evidence of those who claim that he was corrupt. When he was working with the DA, we asked the DA to investigate him, and if they found something wrong they must take those findings to the council. But we can’t just remove Bobani based on high-level gossips.”  Click below to watch related video:
