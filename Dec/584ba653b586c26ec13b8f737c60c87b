The KwaZulu-Natal government has assembled a team of MEC’s to mediate between the two factions of the embattled Shembe Nazareth Baptist Church. Tensions between the eBuhleni and Thembezinhle factions resurfaced after the Supreme Court of Appeal’s recent decision to uphold the decision of the High Court in Durban. The High Court ruled in favour of the late Vela Shembe from the Thembezinhle faction as the rightful leader of the church. Premier Sihle Zikalala said they wanted to ensure that the court judgment was peacefully implemented. “We have noted as the Executive council the simmering tension within the Shembe church induced by the latest court decision. The provincial executive counsel expressed concerns around potential threats to peace that this conflict poses. As the government of the province we have resolved to intervene, mediate and work with them to ensure that all issues that are part of the tension are resulted properly…” “The Executive council has delegated a team to work in the mediation process,” added Zikalala.
