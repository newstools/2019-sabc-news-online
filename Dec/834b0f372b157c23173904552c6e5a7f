Residents of KwaMeyi in uMzimkhulu, southern KwaZulu-Natal, are trying to rebuild their homes after they were damaged by heavy rains coupled with hail and strong winds on Monday. Several houses and schools had their roofs blown off in KwaDladla, Mahhedle and Ncakubana in the Ubuhlebezwe Municipality. Sixty-five-year-old Ntobeko Lukhozi’s newly-built house was extensively damaged in the storm. “The storm started and before we knew it, parts of the roof was falling on us in the house with most of it was blown away by the wind. My new furniture, I haven’t even started using yet, was damaged by the rain. I don’t know what I’m going to do but I am grateful that we came out alive.”
