Two women, Mamoketsi Seleso 52 and Rosina Seleso 29, who have been found guilty on several counts of manufacturing and possession of child pornography, are expected to be sentenced. The mother and daughter will appear in the High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Sentencing proceedings in the case of the women convicted on numerous counts of human trafficking and racketeering is expected to get under way. In 2015, the Seleso’s lured their 16-year-old relative from Lesotho to South Africa and sexually exploited her for monetary benefit. The pair forced her to perform things which were streamed live on an online website to paying clients and pocketed the proceeds until they were arrested in October 2017. In his judgment, acting Judge Daniel Mogotsi said the state proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the pair lured their 16-year-old relative from Lesotho under the false pretence of a better education to sexually exploit her for monetary gain. He went on to say that it’s clear that they both knew exactly what they were doing, as they hid the girl’s passport from her and kept her at their house on Gauteng’s Westrand against her will.
