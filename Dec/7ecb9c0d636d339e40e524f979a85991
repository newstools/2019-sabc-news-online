Trade union Solidarity has welcomed the adopted resolution by government to place embattled South African Airways (SAA) on business rescue. SAA was placed on voluntary business rescue to prevent the cash-strapped airline from imploding. The announcement earlier on Thursday comes almost a week after the troubled airline communicated its intention to oppose an application by labour union Solidarity for the beleaguered state carrier to be placed under business rescue. Solidarity Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dirk Hermann says their own application will automatically fall away. “So, the fact is that we can’t continue with our application. What we, as organised labour, will do now is to influence the process of appointing the business rescue practitioner,” says Hermann. Related Video below:
