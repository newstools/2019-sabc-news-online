The heatwave which is sweeping over most parts of the country is expected to subside from Tuesday afternoon, with rainfall anticipated for tonight heading into Wednesday. The South African Weather Services says cooler temperatures are expected from Wednesday in Gauteng as well as isolated thundershowers in some parts of the province. Forecaster Dipuo Tawana says: “We are expecting the temperatures to cool down over Gauteng on Tuesday. This is our last day of this heatwave. From Wednesday onward our maximum temperatures are expected to be in the mid 20s.” Temperatures in some parts of Mpumalanga and North West are expected to remain high. Tawana says: “We are expecting temperatures to be in their 30s, with Skukuza expected to reach 42 on Tuesday. Musina and Lephalale are expected to reach 39.” “The temperatures over the Western Cape are quite cool because of the cold front that made landfall on Monday.”
