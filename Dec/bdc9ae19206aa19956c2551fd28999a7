City of Tshwane Executive Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, has been booted out of his position by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) when their motion of no-confidence in him succeeded in the council meeting. The ANC and EFF voted for the motion. The motion succeeded with 111 votes. The DA and smaller parties didn’t vote. The DA, throughout the process, called the process illegal. The acting EFF Speaker, Obukeng Ramabodu, disputed it, saying the council is legal. The DA has indicated they are taking the matter to court.
