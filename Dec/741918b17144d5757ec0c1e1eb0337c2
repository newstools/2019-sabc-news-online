The African National Congress (ANC) in Tshwane says it plans to approach the Hawks to investigate allegations of fraud and misrepresentation against the Democratic Alliance (DA) and embattled former Tshwane MMC, Sheila Senkubuge. This after a member of the public laid charges with the police regarding allegations that Senkubuge was elected as Proportional Councillor for the DA in 2016, even though she was not even a South African citizen. It is alleged that she was a Ugandan citizen at the time of her appointment. The DA has said it will also probe the allegations. Senkubuge resigned on Friday, amid allegations of involvement in what is being dubbed a ‘sex in the city’ scandal and political collusion. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) confirmed that Senkubuge has two identity numbers that were used to register as a voter.  WATCH related video below:
