Mamelodi flood victims, still housed at the Baptist Church in the east of Pretoria, say although they are spending Christmas without their families, they are grateful for the help from the church. More than 1 300 people were displaced when more than 700 shacks were destroyed by floods three weeks ago. It was a bitter-sweet church service underscored by love and appreciation. More than 200 displaced people are still sheltered at the church. They enjoyed the Christmas service with the rest of the congregation. Some spoke about their pain of spending Christmas homeless and without family. “I lost everything but I’m still alive,” said one of the people. It has been 16 days since their homes were swept away, however, they remain positive. “It has been hard but this church has made things so easy. We are here and we are a community and a family. I will never go back to that place I’d rather stay here,” said flood victim, Thulani Ndlovu. The church has become a safe haven for many women and children. “We are all going to enjoy this day. Today is an unusual and difficult day but we are doing the work of God. The sad part is that we have children with new clothes on and others have nothing yet they all have to play and eat together. It’s about sharing and spreading love and humanity,” said Pastor Thebelani Jentile.
