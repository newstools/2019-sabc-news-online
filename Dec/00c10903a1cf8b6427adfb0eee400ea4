Another young life has been lost at an illegal initiation school in Johannesburg, Gauteng. The 23-year-old man died on Christmas Eve at a school near Crown Mines in Johannesburg. The owner of the school has been arrested. Gauteng Controlesa’s Prince Manene Tabane says a post mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death. “The initiate he is from Sedibeng. The post mortem has not yet been conducted, but from what we got from the people around the initiation school was that he started to lose appetite on the 22nd then he passed on the 24th at 3am in the morning in the initiation school. The police have been informed I got a call last night from the NPC of the SAPS inquiring about the death of the initiate. When the police went there the school owner was arrested yesterday night,” Tabane says. This is a second death at an illegal initiation school in Gauteng this week. A few days ago 16-year-old Mpho Mothupi died after sustaining injuries at an illegal initiation school in Lenasia. 23 initiates were taken to hospital after another bogus school in Vanderbijlpark was shut down. The CRL Commission has previously urged community stakeholders to do all they can to protect the lives of initiates.
