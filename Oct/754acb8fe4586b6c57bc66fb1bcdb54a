The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has disputed reports that there are factions within the party. The leadership of the party was conducting a site visit to Nasrec, south of Johannesburg, on Monday, where the party’s second elective conference will take place in December. Weekend reports claim a decision seems to have been made by party leader Julius Malema to remove National Chairperson Dali Mpofu ahead of the conference. However, another faction has put forward a list where Mpofu has been named as Chairperson. Malema says that every position in the EFF will be contested. Mpofu would not be drawn into confirming his availability should he be nominated for the leadership position from the floor during the conference. “This organisation will never be factionalised. So all those in the media that are trying to factionalise this organisation are going to fail because we have no time for factions; we have time for contestation…Contestation must never be confused with factionalism,” says Mpofu. Meanwhile, Malema says the party is currently exploring its popularity on the continent and internationally. Malema, who is travelling to Nigeria, says the party is also looking to bring in an international relations expert. “A lot of interest has been shown in the continent and international towards the EFF, but the EFF does not grab that opportunity with both hands. I dont understand maybe the SG when he gives that report will explain why did we fail to appreciate the fact that the continent and the international community including the diaspora is receiving the EFF very well. But the EFF is not responding, in the discussion document one of the areas we are raising is perhaps to get a full time person to deal with these issues.”  Watch the video below for more:  – Report by Nomalizo Mandela
