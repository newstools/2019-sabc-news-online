The lawyer for US President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, appeared on Fox New’s “The Ingraham Angle” on Tuesday after the Republican chairperson of the US Senate Judiciary Committee opened the door to a Senate investigation into unproven allegations regarding Ukraine raised by Giuliani and inviting the attorney to testify. “I have to weigh that with my client and the other lawyers involved. It’s it’s not a unitary decision. What decision I make may affect the other decisions. I mean, I would love to testify and give me a half hour to point out Biden Inc. four decades of crime. I’d love to do it,” said Giuliani. Giuliani and his unsubstantiated allegations are central to the Democratic impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, which followed a July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Judiciary Committee chairperson Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, did not give specific dates for a potential Giuliani appearance or any other public hearings on the matter. Giuliani also commented on the eight-page letter the White House sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, rejecting an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats in the House as “constitutionally invalid” and saying it would refuse to cooperate with the probe absent a vote of the full House. “People should read the letter for themselves. It’s a very well written, legal letter. It’s supported by precedent,” said Giuliani.
