Speculation is rife ahead of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Federal Council meeting this weekend, where the party is expected to elect a new federal council chairperson and discuss the organizational review panel report ahead of the 2021 local government elections. Former DA leader Helen Zille, Federal Chairperson Athol Trollip, the council’s deputy chairperson Thomas Walters and deputy Chief Whip Mike Waters are contesting the position. However, Zille and Trollip are front-runners. Some 155 DA members will vote in the hotly-contested election which takes place after the DA’s poor showing in this year’s national and provincial elections. Earlier this week, during a media briefing at the DA’s headquarters in Bruma, Johannesburg, the party’s Presiding Officer, Desiree Van Der Walt gave details of the election process. “All four candidates will have an opportunity to address the Federal Council for five minutes and motivate why they believe they are the best person to occupy the office of Federal Council chairperson and on Sunday morning, 7 o’clock, voting will take place up until 8:45. Without identification, we will not permit any person of the council to cast their vote. Once the votes have been counted and captured, the presiding officer will announce the results.” Watch related videos:
