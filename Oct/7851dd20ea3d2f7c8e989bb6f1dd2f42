The Gauteng Education Department has urged parents who have received offers of placement for the 2020 admissions to accept the offer immediately. The Department says should the parents not accept the offers; it will lead to the system being clogged.   Gauteng Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona says this will also result in the system not being able to release further placement offers to parents who are still on the waiting list… “Placement processes are actually unfolding. When parents accept offers, more offers can be released to others. Parents who have not yet received offers of placement are reminded that the process to send offers will end on Thursday, 31 October 2019.”
