Johannesburg Emergency Services says they will remain on high alert after the South African Weather Service issued a warning for severe thunderstorms in various parts of the country on Thursday night. The Weather Service says a 60% chance of rainfall is expected for Gauteng as well as Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says they will stay on high alert. “We will remain on high alert, monitoring all our seven regions of the city for any emergency which might occur, so that we may be able to respond as quickly as possible. So, we just want to urge our residents, especially our motorists to exercise caution as they drive throughout the city of Johannesburg,” says Mulaudzi.
