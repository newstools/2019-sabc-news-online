Zimbabwe‘s striking doctors will lose their monthly salaries as they continue with the industrial action. The medical practitioners have been on strike since 3 September. They have defied the labour court’s ruling that nullifies the strike’s legitimacy. The doctors’ union, Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, claims they are being victimized and pressured to end their strike action. Union Secretary, Tawanda Zvakada says they are raising funds to supplement their withheld salaries. “The most recent assault has been the withholding of our October salaries for all doctors who have not been reporting to duty due to the very fact that they are financially liquidated. This move has done nothing but further incapacitate and embolden the doctors to continue fighting for a living wage. Through our affiliate associations we have been forced to setup a crowd funding platform to help ease the financial crisis being faced by our members.”
