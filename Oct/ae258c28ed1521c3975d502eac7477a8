Five people including a toddler lost their lives after walls collapsed on them. Technicians from power utility Eskom spent Monday trying to restore power supply. Eskom spokesperson, Zama Mpondwana has urged the close on 7000 affected customers in the village to treat all electricity appliances live. “As Eskom, we are on track in trying to repair damage caused by the storm in Manzimdaka village at Cala. We are roping in contractors to assist us after the damage last Sunday. There’s a lot of damage there. We tried yesterday for example to backfeed 50% of the customers around the area, but we lost that as well, during the night due to overload. We’re hoping that we’ll start soon to plant new poles and all of that, so that the community can get its electricity back as soon as possible,” says Mpondwana. Watch a related video below:
