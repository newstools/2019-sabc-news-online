Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, has urged matric learners to use the Department’s digital e-learning platform to prepare for their examinations. He was briefing the media in Johannesburg, on the province’s state of readiness for the 2019 National Senior Certificate Examinations (NSC). Candidates will write their final NSC Exams from the 23rd of October to 28th of November. Lesufi says the Department is prepared to conduct the exams. “We have managed to digitalise all our curriculum content for all our subjects. Even a parent can log on – if your child asks for the homework and you are not sure, you can log in, and listen to that teacher on the video and animation in terms of the previous question papers. You can also set your own test for your child, and the system will mark that test and indicate where your child is struggling,” says Lesufi.  Meanwhile,  the Free State government is confident that it will reclaim the first position in the final national matric results. The province held a Matric pledge signing ceremony in Bloemfontein. Many of the matriculants who signed are happy with the province’s efforts to help them achieve top spot. They are hoping to make the Free State proud. The Department of Basic Education, on Friday highlighted that the credibility of the 2019 national examination takes priority over everything else. The Department said this includes the security of the examination papers to protect the integrity of the process. Deputy Director General for Planning and Assessment in the Department Paddy Padayachee said the benchmark of the National Senior Certificate is set against international standards. This year’s batch of Grade 12 learners is set to sit for examinations in two weeks.
