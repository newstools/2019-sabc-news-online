Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to confirm in writing that the State will not foot former president, Jacob Zuma’s legal bills. Maimane was reacting to Zuma’s intention to appeal the judgment of the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, which dismissed his application for a permanent stay of prosecution, regarding the corruption charges related to the multi-billion-rand arms deal. In 2018, the High Court in Pretoria found that the decisions of former president Thabo Mbeki and President Ramaphosa to pay for Zuma’s legal fees were unlawful and illegal. The court ordered Zuma to pay back the money the State had already incurred for his pending cases. Zuma’s case has been postponed to February 2020. Watch a related video below for more on the story:
