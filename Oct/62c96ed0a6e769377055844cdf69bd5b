The Mankweng Regional Court outside Polokwane is expected to sentence convicted rapist, Pastor James Thubakgale on Tuesday. The court convicted Thubakgale in August for raping two members of his church, including one who was fourteen-years-old at the time. Sentencing began on Monday with the court giving its pre-sentencing report. Yesterday, members of Thubakgaleâ€™s Divine Deliverance Church, who previously supported him, now protested outside court calling for a hefty sentence.  They say that more minors have come forward with similar allegations at church. Thubakgale is also facing three other rape charges at the Seshego Magistrate court.
