The Labour Court in Johannesburg has granted an interim interdict against the planned strike action by National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA)-affiliated workers from Air Chefs. The AirChefs company is responsible for preparing food for SAA, SA Express, Mango and Swiss Airline flights. NUMSA called for the strike after accusing management of unilaterally withdrawing anniversary bonuses. Workers are demanding that this bonus be paid as it is part of their employment benefits. NUMSA Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says the court recognized that the strike may not be protected. “The court has recognized that they have prima-facie evidence to suggest that our strike may not be protected. Of course as NUMSA we disagree with that notion. We remain convinced that on this issues we were on the right side of the law and we will demonstrate that. The court has given us a return date, sometime in November, to return and make our arguments on this issue,” says Hlubi-Majola. Watch video below:
