Eskom says it will be implementing Stage 1 load shedding from 9am-11pm on Friday, but doesn’t expect further load shedding for the rest of the weekend.   Addressing the media at the OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg, acting CEO, Jabu Mabuza says that it has recovered lost capacity after imposing Stage 2 load shedding on Wednesday. Mabuza says they already knew on Monday that they would need to impose load shedding. “Whilst some units returned to service on Monday, we had other units that tripped and found ourselves with severely constrained power systems without emergency reserves that we needed to carry us through and by the time we were planning for Tuesday morning peak it became clear that we were not going to make it without compromising the system thus the decision to implement load shedding was made as our last resort.” Eskom says Friday’s stage one load shedding will be the last for the foreseeable future. “We will implement stage one load shedding tomorrow from 9am until 23 pm thereafter we anticipate no further load-shedding this will allow our pump storage dam levels to be recovered over the weekend this plan required some diesel generation of about 1000 megawatts to be used for short durations over the morning peaks we will keep you South Africans informed about the status and our recovery efforts throughout this period.” Mabuza added that the power system remains constrained and vulnerable although some of the generation units that broke down have been returned to service.
