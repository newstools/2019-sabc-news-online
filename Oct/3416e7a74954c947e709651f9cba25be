Former Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa says he has instructed his lawyers to sue for defamation after allegations against him resurfaced at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Crime Intelligence Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo told the commission that a Mercedes worth R300 000 was purchased for Mthethwa from the Crime Intelligence slush fund. Naidoo also revealed to the State Capture Inquiry that security renovations were done to the private residence of Mthethwa in 2009. However, Mthethwa says these are old allegations and he is going to sue. “I definitely will and I’ve already instructed my lawyers for defamation, we are suing Mr Naidoo R5 million for that because it’s not a new thing.  It is something that everybody knows that these allegations, both of the wall and of the so called SUV came about in 2012 and at the time the DG (Director General) wanted us to investigate, which he did. He spoke to everybody and I was cleared and they know that I was cleared on all counts including the SUV.” Click below for more on the story:
