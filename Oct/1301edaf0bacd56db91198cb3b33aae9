The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it will challenge the new Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (AARTO) Act in court. On Saturday, to mark the launch of Transport Month, Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula announced that the Act would be fully implemented by June 2020. Mbalula also says the exact start date for the AARTO law would soon be proclaimed. In a statement, Outa says it is not opposed to the demerit system being implemented for motorists but that the scheme is flawed in its administrative processes, constitutionality and ability to reduce road fatalities. Outa says attempts to engage with government on the matter, which include writing to President Cyril Ramaphosa, have been ignored. In July, Outa wrote to Ramaphosa, asking him not to sign it into law, saying that it does not withstand constitutional scrutiny. However, the President signed the Act into law in August. Outaâ€™s concerns with the AARTO Amendment Act include that it does not provide an adequate means of traffic offenders receiving notice of the infringement as the Act relies on the Post Office. OUTA also says the Appeals Tribunal is set up in a way that impedes on the rights of citizens as it is inadequately staffed to manage the number of cases of traffic infringements.
