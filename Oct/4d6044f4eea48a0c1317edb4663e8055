The Office of the Chief Justice says details of outstanding disciplinary cases against some judicial officers are expected to be reflected in the Judicial Services Committee report soon to be released by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. Officials of the Office appeared before the Justice and Correctional Services Committee to present its annual report of the 2018/12019 financial year. African National Congress (ANC) MP Richard Dyantyi asked about the delay in finalising cases of alleged misconduct against Judges John Hlophe and Nkola Motata who are still before the Judicial Conduct Tribunal. The Secretary General of the Office of the Chief Justice Meme Sejosengwe responded to these question. “Chief Justice will present the Judicial Commission annual report in October/November which will contain those details in terms of vacancies, in terms of cases that are before the Judicial Governance structures which one would not be able to go into,” says Sejosengwe.
