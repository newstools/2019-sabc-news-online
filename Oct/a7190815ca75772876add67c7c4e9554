King Sabata Dalindyebo municipality mayor in the Eastern Cape, Nyaniso Nelani, says they are still awaiting the release of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) report on the Mandela funeral fraud allegations. He was speaking at a special council meeting at Nkululekweni in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. The municipality is alleged to have misused more than R30 million in catering and in the hiring of buses and taxis for Nelson Mandela’s funeral in 2013. The report of the Public Protector states that the municipality incurred unauthorised expenditure for the funeral. It further states that even if the expenditure was authorised, it would have instituted irregular expenditure. Mayor Nelani says when the report is finalised they will table it to the council.  Click on the related video below:
