Three suspects have been arrested for robbing a business in Rooihuiskraal south-west of Pretoria. Police out on routine patrol spotted a number of men running towards a minibus taxi parked along the Old Johannesburg road. When police stopped and searched the vehicle they discovered housebreaking implements, a gun with the serial numbers filled off, a cash box belonging to G4S security company and plastic bags containing food items. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says as soon as the members realised that they were onto a possible business robbery a vehicle was dispatched to the nearby Food Loversâ€™ Market where police found security guards tied up. Three suspects were arrested and the fourth managed to escape. The suspects are expected to appear before the Pretoria Magistrate Court soon.
