The mining community of Skimming outside Mokopane in Limpopo has accused the Mogalakwena Platinum Mine of causing cracks to their houses from blasting activity. Most households are located next to the mine. Some of the residents say the blasting is also accompanied by harmful dust which comes into their homes. Community leader, Douglas Moloto says residents are concerned about their safety. “The mine is always blasting and it is near the community of Leruleng, their blasting is cracking our houses and our windows are broken and each every time after blasting we inhale dust. We are not safe sometimes, maybe our houses can collapse.” Anglo American spokesperson, Jana Marais says the mine repairs damaged houses if investigations prove it is responsible for cracks. “We have a system for communities around Mogalakwena to submit any issues of concern to the mine, concerns around cracked houses are investigated by third parties and where the mine is at fault we take care of the repairs.”
