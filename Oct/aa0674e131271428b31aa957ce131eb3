Several Johannesburg suburbs are still without power following Wednesday’s load shedding. Isaac Mangena, spokesperson for Johannesburg’s power utility, City Power, says they have not been able to restore power as planned after they were met with difficulties. He says their technicians are on-site trying to resolve the matter. “Randburg was part of the (places) that were load shed between 12 and 16.00 hours in the afternoon. They were supposed to be restored around 4pm. But we experienced failure of the equipment due to the ageing infrastructure, both on Eskom and City Power side. We still have areas that are not yet back including Randpark Ridge. It also happened in Ennerdale where we had equipment failure.” Earlier, Eskom announced that it would implement Stage 2 load shedding, which is expected to last until 11pm. City Power has urged residents not to panic as this is only a possibility. The country last experienced load shedding in March 2019.
