Metrorail says investigations are due to begin after four train carriages caught alight at Gleincairn Station in the Cape Peninsula on Monday. The fire affected train services in Simon’s Town and was forced to terminate at Fish Hoek station. Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott, says the train services are now operational again… “The damaged train was taken last night (Monday night) to our depot where it awaits forensic people to investigate the cause of the fire. At this stage, we are unable to give you an assessment of the damage or what it would cost to repair. The line was declared open and safe for operations just before 8 o’clock and this morning (Tuesday morning) the trains are proceeding as usual.”
