Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe will be back in court on Monday for bail application.Â He also submitted an application for leave to appeal his conviction. The student activist was sentenced to 8 years in prison in 2017, with 3 years suspended after pleading guilty to burning a police van at the height of the #Fees Must Fall# protests in 2016. Cekeshe is serving a 5-year jail term at the Leeuwkop Prison after he was sentenced for his involvement in the protests for free higher education. Judgment on both applications will be handed down on Monday.
