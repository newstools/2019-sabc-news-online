Criminal charges have been filed against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan at Durban’s CR Swart Police station. The charges relate to Gordhan’s stint as Commissioner at the South African Revenue Services and were filed by the Durban-based non-governmental organisation Ubumbano Lokuthula Organisation. According to the organisation’s chairperson, Doctor Andile Hlatshwayo, Gordhan continues to benefit from the creation of the SARS Rogue Unit. Doctor Hlatshwayo says, “We are actually here in CR Swart to lay charges against Mr Pravin Gordan on how he established the rouge unit in SARS. We must remember very well that the establishment of the unit was unlawful which however forbids the constitution (Section 209) which created that in the interest of fighting his politics with the interest of state organs which he is misusing. Up to now he is still using the same system which is within the rouge unit of SARS to deprive and also to bug people’s interests in many ways.”
