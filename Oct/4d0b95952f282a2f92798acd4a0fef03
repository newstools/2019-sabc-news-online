Mozambique’s opposition party Renamo has rejected President Filipe Nyusi’s landslide election victory. The result was announced on Sunday following the election on 15th October. Nyusi’s party, Frelimo got 73% of the vote while Renamo presidential candidate Ossufo Momade got 23%. Frelimo won 184 parliamentary seats from 144 in the 2014 polls. Renamo lost 29 of the 89 seats it held. It is claiming massive electoral fraud. During his second five-year term, Nyusi will be responsible for overseeing a gas boom led by oil giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Total, battling a festering Islamist insurgency and delivering on a peace deal signed two months ago. It was hoped the 15 October poll could set the seal on the fragile pact, designed to put a definitive end to four decades of violence between Frelimo and Renamo. The two fought a 16-year civil war that ended in a truce in 1992 but have clashed sporadically since. Instead, the deal is at risk of falling apart as opposition parties reject the results, claiming they were tarnished by fraud, violence and irregularities from the outset. Frelimo says the elections were free and fair. Related video click below:
