As the country goes green and gold on Sunday, South Africans have taken to social media with messages of support, hope and love for the Springboks Team. The Boks are playing against Wales in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals – which kicks off at 11am South African time. The winning team from the encounter will face off with England next weekend. President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent a heartfelt message of support to the Springboks- saying he hopes to be in Japan next weekend to lift the trophy with the team should they win the Rugby World Cup. “I just wanted to wish you very well for the semi-final and I know that you will do extremely well. You’ve got 57-million South Africans standing behind you. Just know that you are doing it for all of us.”
