The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape has written to Council Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya to reschedule a Special Council Meeting that was postponed on the 17th of October. Mafaya cited safety concerns for postponing the meeting, after some councillors were allegedly threatened. One matter on the meeting agenda was the Motion of no confidence against Mayor, Mongameli Bobani. DA Deputy Caucus leader, Ryno Kayser says they will approach the court to seek a directory order if the meeting is not rescheduled for no later than November 06.
