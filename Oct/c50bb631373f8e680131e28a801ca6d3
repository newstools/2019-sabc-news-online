President Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed what he terms Russia’s commitment to deepening its engagement with Africa. This is after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country wanted to double its trade with the continent in the next five years.  On Ramaphosa’s visit, deals worth billions of dollars are expected to be signed in the fields of nuclear energy, mining, oil, gas and agriculture. Ramaphosa held bi-lateral talks with his Russian counterpart. “Appreciate your effort in bringing together all these African countries. Obviously, the platform that we are utilising is economic development and we appreciate that as Africa being part of the effort- the Africa Free Trade area presents an opportunity for African countries to participate with Russia in a meaningful way.”
