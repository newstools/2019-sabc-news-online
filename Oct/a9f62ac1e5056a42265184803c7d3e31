Eleven out of the 13 Western Cape government departments have received a clean audit by the Auditor General for the 2018/19 financial year. The Department of Education received an unqualified opinion with findings and the Agriculture Department received a qualified opinion with findings. Provincial Finance Minister, David Maynier, says the star performer was the Department of Health which received a clean audit for the first time. ” These audit outcomes are the result of a concerted effort to ensure that good governance remains at the heart of what we do in the Western Cape Government. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the officials for their diligent leadership and hard work in delivering this result.”
