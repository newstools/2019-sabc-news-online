National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise is expected to appear in the Potchefstroom regional court in the North West for charges of animal cruelty. Modise is accused of leaving her North West farm unattended, without water or food causing the death of more than 50 pigs and other animals in 2014. The case follows a successful private investigation conducted by Civil Rights Organisation, AfriForumâ€™s private prosecution unit on behalf of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA).
