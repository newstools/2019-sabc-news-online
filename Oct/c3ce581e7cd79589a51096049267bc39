Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has withdrawn her Department’s explanation to Parliament regarding the Auditor General’s (AG) findings for the 2018/19 audit. The Department was scheduled to account on its action plan in response to the Auditor General’s findings. Zulu, who could not attend the meeting, wrote to inform the committee that she was not happy with the response the Department had prepared. The AG found that the Department had incurred more than R14 million in unauthorised, irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. The committee agreed to reschedule the briefing to next week. The Secretary of the Social Development Committee read out part of Zulu’s letter. “My decision to withdraw the Department’s aforesaid presentation is informed by my assessment that it lacks pointed responses relevant to the AG’s reports. Notwithstanding, I take full responsibility for this report. Let me assure you and honourable members of the portfolio committee that I am steadfast on realising evidence-based results, planning, implementation and reporting throughout this mandate.”
