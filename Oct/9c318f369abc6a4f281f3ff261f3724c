Police Minister Bheki Cele says some dockets are already before the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for prosecution of people implicated in corruption in relation to the downfall of now-liquidated VBS Mutual Bank. Cele was speaking at the launch of the national rural community safety strategy in Louis Trichardt in Limpopo. Politically connected people allegedly looted the bank. Municipalities also illegally deposited council funds at the bank. Cele says progress is being made in holding those responsible for looting VBS to account. “Dockets are in front of the NPA,  there’s progress on VBS but I’m not going to say we are investigating you and you   but there are investigations that even some of them are even ready for prosecution .” Meanwhile, Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Co-operative Governance says it will get to the bottom of illegal investments by municipalities with the liquidated  bank. The committee held meetings with representatives of the Collins Chabane, Makhado, Giyani and Vhembe municipalities. These are some of the municipalities which lost a combined R1 billion illegally invested in the mutual bank.  The committee also met community organisations. Committee member, Haniff Hoosen says they will ensure that justice is served. “We are very committed to getting to the bottom of this VBS thing. It can’t be right that there are people in this room and there are people who are not in this room who gave their lives to make the lives of their children better, I want you to know the commitment of people in this portfolio committee, we’re trying to make the difference and what we’ve seen is wrong; we’ll raise our voice in Parliament.”
