An opposition councillor in the Elias Motsoaledi Municipality at Groblersdal in Limpopo says he has been receiving death threats related to the VBS saga from an identified caller. Seun Mogotji of the Bolsheviks Party says the caller instructed him to defend the R55 million investment in VBS and to block the discussion on the future of the suspended municipal manager. Mogotji says he received a call while in Johannesburg, and a case was opened at Mondeor Police Station. Mondeor police confirmed that the case was opened, but was transferred to the provincial office in Limpopo. The municipality is yet to comment. “I received a call. The person said he wants to settle the issue of the municipal manager and VBS because we cannot hold one person liable for the VBS matter. He said to me I must make sure that I protect the issue of VBS, (that) it doesn’t even come to the council; for me to be safe, I must protect this issue of VBS. Now, this came as a threat. I had to go and open a case with the police so that they can investigate if the council can decide to expel the MM. The same person is going to hold me liable because he says I’m in the centre of the VBS matter,” explains Mogotji.
