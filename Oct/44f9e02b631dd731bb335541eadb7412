MEC Morakane Mosupyoe has been appointed as the MEC of economic development replacing former Tshwane mayor, Kgosientso “Spulta” Ramakgopa who tendered his resignation earlier on Friday. Gauteng Premier David Makhura had until Friday to meet the ANC NEC deadline to replace one of his male MEC’s with a woman. This is in line with the NEC’s resolution that says that where a premier is male, 60% of the executive must be women. The ANC in Gauteng was under pressure to drop a male MEC by the end of this week, following the NEC’s resolution of gender parity. “I have taken some time to effect  this decision of the governing party to allow all the members of the executive council to finalise their plans in line with the commitments I announced during the State of The Province Address in July. Members of the executive council have since then engaged in extensive consultation with various stakeholders around finalizing our plan – Growing Gauteng Together,” Makhura says. Ms. Mosupyoe served as a councillor in the City of Tshwane from 2006 – 2016. During this period, she also served as the MMC for Health and Social Development. In 2011 she became the first female speaker of the City of Tshwane until 2016 when the term ended. Makhura adds, “I am confident that Ms. Mosupyoe will build on the solid foundation laid by Dr. Ramokgopa towards the realisation of our vision of growing the economy of our province. She will continue with the process of creating an integrated multi-tier Special Economic Zone (SEZ).”
