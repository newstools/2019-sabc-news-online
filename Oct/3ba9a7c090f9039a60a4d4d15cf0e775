Over 400 shacks destroyed by a fire at the Max informal settlement in Pomona in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg last month, are being rebuilt. Close to a thousand people including women and children were left homeless after a massive five destroyed their homes. The affected residents are currently being housed at a temporary shelter in Kempton park. City of Ekurhuleni Housing MMC Lesiba Mpya says the rebuilding process started over the past weekend. “The shack fires that emerged will actually be mitigated upon, because we are spacing the shacks evenly, and we are also making access roads. We are ensuring that the ambulances and waste collection cars will be able to access the area.”
