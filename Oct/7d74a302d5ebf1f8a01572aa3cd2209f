Limpopo police are searching for five awaiting trial prisoners who escaped from holding cells at Witpoort, outside Lephalale. The suspects, aged between 19 and 39, allegedly escaped through a hole they dug in the police cells on Monday evening. They are facing murder, rape and robbery charges. Police’s Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says additional charges of escaping from custody have been opened. The police are making an appeal to members of the community to assist with information that can lead to the re-arrest of the escapees. “Anyone with information is requested to contact detective warrant officer Ratlou Morudu at 082 468 8931 or call the nearest police station,” says Mojapelo.
