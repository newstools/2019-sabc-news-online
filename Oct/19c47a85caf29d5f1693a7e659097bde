A psychologist has told the High Court in Pretoria that the self-confessed child rapist, Nicholas Ninow, is not a paedophile. The psychologist, who asked not to be named, testified in mitigation of sentencing in Ninowâ€™s rape trial. Ninow was found guilty of raping the then six-year old girl in September last year at a Dros Restaurant. He also pleaded guilty to the possession of drugs and defeating the ends of justice. The psychologist told the court that Ninow was emotionally, physically and sexually abused until he was 8 years old and has been abusing drugs since he was 13 years old.
