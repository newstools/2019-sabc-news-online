Three Northern Cape learners aged 17-years-old are on Friday expected to make their second court appearance on a count of murder. Itâ€™s alleged that the trio stoned and stabbed their fellow learner to death at the Blinkklip High school in Postmansburg, last Tuesday. It is believed an altercation between the learners occurred when the three learners then allegedly pelted Witbooi with stones and stabbed him on the head. Witbooi was transported to the Robert Sobukwe hospital in Kimberley for brain operation but later died. He was also a striker for the ABC Motsepe League side, for the Tsantsabane Stars FC soccer team. The three learners have been in custody since their first court appearance. Witbooi will be buried on Saturday in Postmasburg.
