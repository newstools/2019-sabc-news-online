Convicted rapist Johannes Oelofse will be sentenced next Thursday in the High Court in Johannesburg. In May 2019, 60-year-old Oelofse was convicted of raping, sexually assaulting and grooming his mentally ill stepdaughter, over a seven-year period. During sentencing proceedings, Oelofse asked the court for a non-custodial sentence on grounds of his age and medical condition. His defence says that he will not be able to receive proper medical care for his anxiety in prison. However, the state argued that his condition doesnâ€™t justify him being kept out of prison on a non-custodial sentence. State prosecutor Nerisa Naidoo also submitted that the mentally disabled victim continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and that Oelofse must receive a harsh sentence for his actions.
