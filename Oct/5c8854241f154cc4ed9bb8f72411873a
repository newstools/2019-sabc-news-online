Forestry Minister, Barbara Creecy will on Saturday hand over fishing rights licenses to small-scale co-operatives at Umzumbe on the KwaZulu-Zatal south coast. The licenses are expected to be valid for 15 years. The latest move is the department’s effort to assist small-scale fisherfolk to generate income from fishing. So far, over 300 communities from the country’s coastal areas have registered their interest in being recognised as small-scale fisherfolk.
