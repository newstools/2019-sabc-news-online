The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Federal Executive is meeting in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Top on the agenda is the departure of Herman Mashaba as the Johannesburg mayor. The party has seen a lot of criticism from within its ranks and across the country, for a lack of diversity following the election of Helen Zille as the new Federal Council chairperson at the weekend. Mashaba resigned from the DA and as Johannesburg Mayor on Monday. The FedEx is meeting behind closed doors at the DA headquarters in Bruma. It will also deliberate on the “Organisational Review Report” compiled by former leader, Tony Leon. The scathing report labelled Maimane as an indecisive and inconsistent leader who created factionalism in the party. The report  recommended that Maimane must step aside after a decrease in the party’s performance at the polls in May this year. Click below to watch related videos:
