The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called for the immediate axing of the entire Eskom board and its senior management because it says they have failed to fix the power utility after two years at the helm. Cosatu says it is very worried about Eskom Chairperson and Acting Chief Executive Officer Jabu Mabuza‘s announcement that the power utility is expected to lose another R20 billion next year. The Federation says it believes what it calls continued “mismanagement” at Eskom is an “underhanded ploy” to force its unbundling and privatisation. Eskom earlier said it would challenge energy regulator, Nersa’s decision to allow it a tariff increase of between 5 and 9% over the next three years, saying it needs much more if it is to emerge from its debt crunch.
