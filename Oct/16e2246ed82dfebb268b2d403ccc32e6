Opposition parties in Botswana are complaining that the playing field is not level in terms of political party funding in that country. This, as the country is ready to hold its general elections on Wednesday next week. Sidney Pilane of Botswana Movement for Democracy says this gives the governing party an advantage over other parties. “It is the two parties that have millions. Nobody knows where they get those millions from. What gives them access to millions, that doesn’t give the other parties the access to those millions? Let me tell you what money does… it gives access to the voter. It influences the voter. It influences the outcome of the elections. So, perhaps we need to be honest and decide, and that doesn’t only happen in Botswana, it happens in every country.  We must be honest and decide, that for a party to meaningfully participate in elections, it must have a certain minimum amount of money.” The ruling Botswana Democratic Party’s Ame Makoba, says it is experience in election campaigns that counts. “We are experienced. We’ve won eleven consecutive elections now. We are experienced campaigners. And our preparations are well on course to deliver a twelfth consecutive election victory, under president Dr Masisi, with his transformative agenda for the Republic of Botswana, which people are responding very warmly to.”
