Two police officers suspected of breaking into the Dalton Post Office in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and stealing money, have been shot and killed. The officers were killed during a shootout with members from the crime intelligence unit and the Hawks, who were conducting investigations into crime patterns in the area. National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said, “Several police units were conducting an operation in the area [Dalton] when they tried to flag down a police patrol van on the road between Greytown and Dalton…” However the occupants of the police patrol van, a sergeant and constable, opened fire and were subsequently killed in the shootout, said Naidoo. Members of the crime intelligence unit and the Hawks proceeded to inspect the vehicle and found an angle grinder, jack-hammer and ink-stained banknotes, suspected to have been stolen from the Post Office.
