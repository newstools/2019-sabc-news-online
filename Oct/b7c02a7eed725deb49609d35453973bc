ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule says they will soon have a political alliance council to iron out all the underlying issues within the tripartite alliance. He says both the SACP and Cosatu were part of the NEC meeting over the weekend in Benoni, Gauteng, where there was robust discussion. Magashule says claims of a lack of consultation with the alliance partners regarding the Economic Development Strategy Plan by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni was discussed. Magashule however says there are no serious issues within the tripartite alliance. “We are going to have a political alliance council so that where there are areas  of disagreement, because we had a real good discussion, where people were open and frank and our differences are not so much, but we said where there are issues that need to be addressed we have actually made sure that we’ll come back and address those issues.” Watch the full media briefing below:
