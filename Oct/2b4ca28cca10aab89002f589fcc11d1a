Water levels in small rivers around Tokyo rose and drains overflowed in Tokyo on Saturday (October 12) as a powerful typhoon churned towards the Japanese capital, bringing with it the heaviest rain and winds in 60 years. Typhoon Hagibis, which means “speed” in Philippine language Tagalog, has caused suspension of train services and people told to remain inside. The storm, which the government warned could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, has already brought record-breaking rainfall in Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo with a whopping 700 mm (27.6 inches) of rain over 24 hours. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest level of warning for some areas in Tokyo, Kanagawa and five other surrounding prefectures, warning of amounts of rain that occur only once in decades. The storm has played havoc with the sporting events currently happening in the country. Rugby World Cup matches have had to be cancelled and the Formula one qualifying session moved to Sunday due to torrential downpours.
