A 35-year old man accused of raping and killing a twelve-year-old girl will make his second appearance in the Nebo Magistrate’s Court in Sekhukhune in Limpopo on Tuesday. Bheki Rapolai has been charged with the kidnapping, rape and murder of Thandi Mampane. During Rapolai’s previous appearance two weeks ago, angry residents protested outside the court. Chaos broke out when the residents attempted to attack him when he was being escorted out of court into a police van. Some of them have called for a harsher sentence and that he be denied bail. Mampane’s body was found in the bushes after she had disappeared for a day. She was last seen leaving school.
