President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasised his view about the attacks that took place in targeting foreign nationals. Ramaphosa says it was pure criminality and nothing else. He was addressing the council of provinces question and answer session. He says the country’s policy is to promote the respect for human rights. “We are embarking on a process, a campaign really of engaging all and sundry so that we are all at one, in as far as condemning intolerance, condemning violence and this was so clearly and well-articulated during my meeting with President Buhari.
