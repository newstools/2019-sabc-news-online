Police have cautioned parents to take extra care of their children around swimming pools. This comes as the South African Weather Service warns of yet another heatwave this weekend. Temperatures are expected to go as high as 38 degrees Celsius in provinces such as Limpopo and Mpumalanga. In Gauteng, temperatures are expected to hover around 36 degrees Celsius. Gauteng Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says we are nearing towards the end of year where parties will be conducted. “We have noticed that because of the heatwave children would be going to swimming pools so we would caution parents to keep a close eye on their children so that we avoid drownings. We also know that it’s nearing end of school year where parties would be held where things like date rape have been known to happen during such events. So, we really want to caution our public to take extra care in terms of their own protection,” says Peters.
