Deputy Justice Minister, John Jeffreys says gender based violence remains a high priority for government. Jeffreys says while government needs to tighten its laws, violence against women is a broader societal issue that needs men to change attitudes. He was speaking on the side-lines of the meeting of the Black Lawyers Association in Cape Town to discuss the scourge of gender based violence. Jeffreys says some of the law that need to be improved, include those of domestic violence. “There’s some legal confusion as to how many times you have to be subjected to domestic violence to get an order, to clear that up. Also issues to look at would be compiling a central database of all domestic violence orders so that if the order is granted by one court and the man gets arrested for assault somewhere else, that the prosecution can get access to that order very quickly.” Related video click below:
