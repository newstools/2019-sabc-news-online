The Council for Geoscience has confirmed that a 3.7 magnitude tremor swept through KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday afternoon. Reports are coming in from areas including Durban, Hillcrest and Port Shepstone. The Council for Geoscience’s Mahlatse Mononela says at this stage, the exact cause of the tremor remains unclear. “ Yes there was an earth tremor that took place at around 13h19. This tremor hit roughly south west of Durban around 72 km with magnitude of 3.7. At this point we cannot confirm if there will be another one hitting.”
