Eskom says no load shedding is planned for Sunday. However, the power utility says it could be implemented at short notice should there be a significant shift in plant performance. It says the system remains constrained and volatile. On Saturday stage one load shedding ended at 23:00. Eskom says while some units have returned to service as planned, emergency diesel and water reserves had to be used to supplement capacity, as generating units returned later than expected. It says plans are progressing well in repairing the conveyor belt at Medupi power station to achieve full operation, and to expedite the return of units that experienced technical problems.   ew
