Cape Town’s water consumption this week has exceeded the current 650 million litres per day limit.  The City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Water and Waste, Xanthea Limberg, says after an extended period of water savings, residents have for the first time exceeded the targeted level of water consumption with up to 657 million litres a day. Dams supplying Cape Town are currently at 79.7% of storage capacity, a drop of 1 percent from the previous week.  She has cautioned residents to keep a closer eye on consumption levels. Last week, the Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Ministry said the main water pipeline providing water from George to the Wilderness area had collapsed and has fallen into the sea. Ministry spokesperson, James-Brent Styan said the engineers working on the repair job estimate that an emergency pipeline will be in place by the end of last week to lessen the water shortages.
