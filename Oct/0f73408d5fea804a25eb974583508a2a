President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasised that Eskom is not going to be privatised. He is answering questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Ramaphosa says the government is instead looking for smart partnerships within the private sector and the government will remain with full ownership of the power utility. “What I would like it to make clear is that we are not privatising Eskom. We are going to be looking at smart partnerships that can be struck. It is possible that we can have smart partnerships with other entities on certain aspects of Eskom. Smart partnerships is what we would promote as the state continues to have full ownership.” Watch video below for more on the story:
