The South African Weather Service has issued a warning of a heat wave across large parts of the country. Temperatures are expected to reach a maximum of 37 degrees celsius in places such as Skhukhuza in Mpumalanga and Upington and Kimberley in the Northern Cape.     Forecaster Kgolofelo Mahlangu says the heat wave is expected to last until Sunday in most parts of the country. “So it is pretty normal temperatures to experience around this time of the year. Remember we are now in the spring season, late spring and soon we will be going into summer. So these kinds of temperatures are quiet normal.”
