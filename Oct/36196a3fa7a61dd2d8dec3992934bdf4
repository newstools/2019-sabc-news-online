The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) says it has so far received 129 000 funding applications for the 2020 academic year. NSFAS will on Wednesday visit KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces on a roadshow. This is to encourage students who qualify to apply on time and avoid delays in acquiring funding. NSFAS Media Liaison Officer, Phathisa Ntlonze, says they are trying to reach out to the youth in areas that lack application resources. Ntlonze says they will be visiting Piet Retief in Mpumalanga and Estcourt in KwaZulu Natal. “We sat down and thought about how we can help young people who do not have access to resources like the internet.  NSFAS applications can be done online this year. Those who wish to apply must go online and create an account but those who already have existing accounts need to log in and apply,” says Ntlonze. Watch a related video below:
