Freedom Front Plus (FF+) Leader Pieter Groenewald says only the abolition of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment and Affirmative Action in the Democratic Alliance (DA) may pose a threat to the FF+ constituency. Some commentators have predicted that Zille’s decision to return to a leadership position in the DA is one way of trying to regain some of the party’s lost votes from the FF+. Zille was elected Executive Federal Chairperson of the DA on Sunday. She succeeds James Selfe who held the position for 19 years. Groenewald says Zille’ return is no threat as she does not take final decisions on DA policies, “If the DA abolishes in total Affirmative Action and Black Economic Empowerment, then of course the Freedom Front Plus will be very glad because they have listened to the policies. So I don’t see a threat in Helen Zille as far as that is concerned.”
