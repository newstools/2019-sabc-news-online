Dam levels in the Eastern Cape Province have dropped to below 50%. The provincial government is considering declaring the province a drought disaster area as it is facing a severe drought. The Buffalo City Metro will implement Level Two water restrictions as from November 1st. BCM spokesperson Samnkelo Ngwenya says, “Our main dam, Bridle Drift dam is sitting at 46% but the rest of our  dams in Buffalo City Metro are sitting below 40%, but we are hoping that through these restrictions we will be able to cut the current water consumption battle, and we are really hoping that our people are going to meet us half way and adhere to some of the restrictions that are available to this issue. People need to get permission to refill their swimming pools and we are urging people not to wash their cars twice a week.” Watch related video below:
