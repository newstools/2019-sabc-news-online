Community members of Inanda on the north of Durban have blamed the high levels of crime in the area on a lack of employment and what they term ‘neglect’ from government. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to visit the local police station after it was reported to have the highest number of rape cases in the country in the 2018/2019 period. These cases are said to have increased by 16.7% from the previous financial year. The station is also ranked fourth among the top 30 for murder. One of the residents Dumisani Nkosi says: “The main contributing factor to the crime in our area is the lack of opportunities and support from government. Government needs to ensure that the youth gets opportunities to develop themselves. We must be supported in order to advance ourselves.” “If government can come up with concrete platforms for us to advance ourselves, crime can be reduced.”
