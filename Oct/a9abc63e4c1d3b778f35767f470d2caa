An SABC crew based at Mahikeng in the North West, has been attacked and robbed of their equipment by a group of people in Schweizer-Reneke. The crew was covering a story relating to the closure of the Mamusa municipality by some protesting residents on Monday. The group accused the SABC team for being biased. SABC reporter, Zebilon Maine explains,  “A group of people came into that guest house where we were working at and they started to cause a fracas where one of our colleagues was beaten by one of those people and they forcefully took our equipment. Through the intervention of the police, we managed to get the equipment back and our colleague opened a case of assault and crimea injuria.”
