The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed the candidacy of Helen Zille for the position of Chairperson of the party’s Federal Council. The DA has announced three other candidates who will contest the position. Zille will face off with former Nelson Mandela Metro Mayor Athol Trollip and members of the National Assembly, Mike Waters and Thomas Walters. The election will take place towards the end of October at the much-awaited Federal Council meeting. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi says, “Any member of the organisation in good standing has the right to accept nomination for any position that they get nominated for. There are four nominees for the position of Federal Executive Chair to succeed James Selfe.” Meanwhile, Director of the Auwal Socio-Economic Research Institute Angelo Fick says by throwing her hat in the ring, Zille is signalling that her decision to leave politics could have been uncomfortable. She resigned as DA leader in 2015 and was replaced by Mmusi Maimane, who is serving his second term. Watch a related video below:
