Gauteng premier David Makhura has until Friday to meet the African National Congress (ANC) NEC deadline to replace one of his male MEC’s with a woman. This is in line with the NEC’s resolution that says that where a premier is male, 60% of the executive must be women. Makhura had instead settled for a 50/50 gender parity.  His office and the ANC in Gauteng have not been able to commit to any time frame as to when the premier will announce the reshuffle. Gauteng premier’s spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga he can confirm there will be a reshuffle. “I can’t confirm the actual date that he’s going to do it, he’s still in engagement with the leadership of the ANC in the broader issue of the 60/40 mandated by the NEC of the ANC, and obviously what must be the way forward, I won’t say it will happen or not we’ve not engaged on a time frame.”
