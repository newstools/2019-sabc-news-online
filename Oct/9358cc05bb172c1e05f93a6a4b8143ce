The Pan Africanist Congress‘ (PAC) Narius Moloto says he will appeal against the Independent Electoral Commission’s (IEC) decision to recognise the leader of one of the two factions of the party. On Monday, IEC CEO Sy Mamabolo told SABC News that they had acknowledged Mzwanele Nyhontso as the legitimate leader of the PAC. Moloto says the IEC’s decision is one-sided. He has lashed out at the IEC saying its decision is totally unacceptable. “We are not taking that. We are angry and we’ll make sure that we direct our anger where it needs to be directed. This has happened for too long. It has to stop. In the meantime, we are challenging them because we’ve written to them through our lawyers. Depending on how they respond, we are taking the matter to court, but we take a dim view of the IEC. We believe the IEC commissioners are using that institution to pursue other agendas rather than that of elections.” Moloto says he is disappointed with the IEC because it has continued to attack the PAC. “We are clearly disappointed with the IEC. They are acting outside of the law and constitution. The IEC wasn’t created to adjudicate over disputes. They’re not even supposed to entertain dispute. That has been their policy since 1930. We have them on record. The PAC has been under attack and serious harassment.”
