Two teachers and an administration clerk have appeared in the Dalasile Periodic Court outside Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape for the alleged rape of three male learners. Police say the learners were allegedly lured into the teachers residence under the pretense of assisting them with school work in July this year. It is also alleged that the learners, ages between 14 and 16, were given alcohol before being raped. The three accused are between the ages of 30 and 49. NPA regional spokesperson Luxolo Tyali says the bail hearing of one of the education officials has been transferred to Mthatha after it was discovered that the crime was committed in the town’s nearby village. Tyali says the education official’s case which was transferred to Mthatha magistrate court will be heard on Wednesday. The second accused’s charge,  which was previously sexual assault, was amended and is now a rape charge. His bail application could not be concluded and the matter was adjourned to the 21st of October in the Ngcobo Magistrate Court. The third accused will make a bail application in the same court.
