KwaZulu-Natal Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC, Bheki Ntuli, has called for a thorough investigation into driving licence testing centres across the province. Earlier, a syndicate was uncovered in Pinetown, west of Durban. It was allegedly issuing fraudulent learners licenses. The alleged kingpin was arrested on Thursday and is expected to appear in court soon. “He was arrested yesterday, following an intensive investigation by the Department working together with other law enforcement agencies. We uncovered that this syndicate is operating in Pinetown, wherein people are asked to pay R3 000 and in return they would be issued a learners licence. We are acting very harshly against this, because the issue of fighting fraud and corruption is one of the priorities of this government,” says Kwanele Ncalane, Department spokesperson.
