At least six suspected poachers have been arrested by rangers at the Kruger National Park since the beginning of the month. SANParks Spokesperson Isaac Phaahla says hunting rifles were confiscated in separate incidents. Phaahla says last year at the same time, they had already arrested about 17 poachers. “The two first incidents happened, when rangers spotted and ran after these poachers and then they had support from our K9 and our Airwing unit to suppress them and they were arrested. In the third incident, those people came through the gate in Malelane – where a heavy caliber rifle was found.”
