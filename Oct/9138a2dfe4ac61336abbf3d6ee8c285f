Hundreds of learners have still not returned to school in Du Noon in Cape Town following days of unrest. People are angry about traffic fines for taxi operators. Spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Ministry, Bronagh Hammond, says they are concerned about the high rate of absenteeism. “Obviously we want learners to be safe, obviously that is our main priority and parents must make that decision but we also just want to appeal to community members that this is such a critical time of the year, this is the fourth term . Teachers are trying to finish the delivery of the curriculum ahead of exams, tests as well as assessments, there is actually few more days left for matriculants.” Residents say they are relieved that the unrest has subsided. “Right now I went to do my ID but during the week I could not do it, I’m just relieved I can do the stuff that I could not do during this toyi-toyi (protest),” says one of the residents. Another resident says; “I feel good because we were really suffering, it was very bad and it affects us. We couldn’t go to school because the buses could not come here, because the taxi drivers were beating them up so it affected us very badly.”
