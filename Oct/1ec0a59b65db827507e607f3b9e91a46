Residents of Johannesburg have been urged to use water sparingly as Rand Water implements stage two water restrictions in the city. The demand has increased from the normal 4370-megalitres to 4900-megalitres that Rand Water provides to different municipalities.  On Thursday, Johannesburg Water closed the second Hurst Hill Reservoir effectively leaving residents of some areas without water. The affected areas included Montgomery Park, Alberstville, Melville and Auckland Park. Joburg Water Spokesperson, Isaac Dhludhlu says the situation is being manipulated in order to make sure everybody has water… “They are cutting down supply by between 20 and 40-percent to all City of Johannesburg reservoirs which means that now we need to also start throttling supply because if they are giving us less than 40-percent then we need to also cut down. We are busy manipulating the system to make sure that everybody does have water. The situation right now necessitates that everyone must reduce consumption. If Rand Water doesn’t provide us with enough water then we can’t provide a sustainable service.”
