President Cyril Ramaphosa says the late struggle icon and diplomat, Oliver Reginald Tambo, would have been appalled at the high levels of Gender-Based Violence cases in the country. This follows a recent string of crimes against women – with some members of society calling for harsher sentences for perpetrators. Thousands of South Africans have taken to social media – using the hashtag #AmINext- to call for criminal justice reform. In paying tribute to Tambo, who would have turned 102 on Sunday,  Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. “OR Tambo would have been appalled by the spate of GBV that continues to rage in the country. He would have stood firm in insisting that men in our country that we’ve got to treat women with respect, honour and dignity. ORT would have taken a very strong stance against men who killed and rape the women of our country.”
