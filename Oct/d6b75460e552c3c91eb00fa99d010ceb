Emergency Services have advised people to stay hydrated to prevent heat stroke as extreme hot temperatures are being experienced across the country due to the heat wave. Temperatures are expected to reach a maximum of 37 degrees Celsius in places such as Skhukhuza and Upington in Mpumalanga and Kimberley in the Northern Cape. The heat wave is expected to last until Sunday in most parts of the country. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says they are on high alert. “Drink lots of water since this exposure to extreme hot temperatures can lead to heat cramps, heat exhaustion which might also lead to heat stroke. And also those who are working directly on the sunlight, we urge them to take regular breaks. We also want to urge them to monitor young children to stay away from river streams and dams. Instead we encourage them to visit our public swimming pools.”
