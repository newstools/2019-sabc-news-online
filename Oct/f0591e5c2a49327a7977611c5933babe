Cosatu fears that government may set its sights on ordinary public servants in its drive to reduce the Wage Bill. Finance minister, Tito Mboweni said in his medium term budget policy statement in parliament that the number of public servants earning R1 million a year has doubled in the last three years. After adjusting for inflation the average government wage has risen by 66% in the last 10 years. Mboweni says things needed to change so that South Africa could return to a path of robust economic growth. Cosatu’s first deputy president, Mike Shingange says: “It is not at the service delivery or front line departments like in nurses, home affairs, justice or police departments where the public servant wage bill is bloated.” “When you go a bit up that is where something needs to be done. It is not correct that when the economy is not doing well it is the workers that are blamed, while they are not responsible for the economic choices government makes.” Related Videos below:
