Community leaders in the Vhembe district in Limpopo, are concerned that there has not been any arrest related to the looting and collapse of the now liquidated VBS Mutual Bank. They’ve met Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs in Thohoyandou. Speaking for religious organisations, Dean Tshenuwani Farisani has criticised ANC members who are calling for the re-instatement of ANC provincial Treasurer Danny Msiza and deputy chairperson Florence Radzilani. Msiza and Radzilani have stepped aside over their alleged involvement in the VBS saga. Watch video below:  Farisani says people need to be held to account… “People who’re supposed to go to court to face criminal charges, and maybe a civil case… you march to Frans Mohlala and Luthuli Huse in broad daylight and you say those people must come back, you boldly tell our people that you’re fools because we can bring anybody back in Vhembe, and there’s a struggle by so-called comrades to bring them back and steal again.” Click on the related video below:
