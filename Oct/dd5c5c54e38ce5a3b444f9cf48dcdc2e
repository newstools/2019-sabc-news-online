The world’s fifth largest container shipping line, Hapag-Lloyd has launched its new South African operations in Cape Town. It will start operating in October and its ships will move from Dubai in the United Arab Emirate via Durban to Cape Town. Hapag-Llyod is a container shipping company of German origin, that started operating on the African continent 12 years ago. It is now expanding to South Africa. Wesgro’s Chief Research Officer, Cornelis van der Waal says the country’s sophisticated infrastructure allows for this kind of investment opportunity. “The reality is that SA has the most sophisticated infrastructure, that SA is committed towards investing in maintaining and upgrading this infrastructure and that we have very strong relationships through trade, through investment with the rest of the world; so our position as a key entry point into the continent is absolutely sure.”
