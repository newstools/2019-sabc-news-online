Stage 2 load shedding will continue on Thursday. Eskom Acting Chief Executive Officer Jabu Mabuza says they understand the inconvenience that comes with load shedding, and has assured  South Africans that it is not the company’s objective to load shed. “We understand the inconvenience that comes with load shedding and want to assure our customers and South Africans at large that our objective is not to implement load shedding. If necessary, to do so at minimal levels and with as much predictability as possible,” says Mabuza in a statement. #POWERALERT 2Date: 16 October 2019 Stage 2 rotational loadshedding will continue tomorrow @CityPowerJhb@City_Ekurhuleni @CityofJoburgZA @CityTshwane @eThekwiniM @CityofCT @ewnupdates @eNCA @SABCNewsOnline @SAfmRadio @Radio702 @IOL @News24 @SAgovnews pic.twitter.com/lVTRUKC9FY — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) October 16, 2019  Eskom has apologised to South Africans. The power utility earlier said that the return of load shedding is due to high levels of unplanned breakdowns and could continue for the rest of the week.  In addition, a conveyor belt supplying Medupi Power Station with coal failed on Saturday resulting in low volumes of coal being supplied to the power station. This limited the generating capability to approximately half the station’s output. The country last experienced load shedding in March 2019.
