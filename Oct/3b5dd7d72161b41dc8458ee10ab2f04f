The President of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Geoff Jacobs, has expressed concern about the effect of Eskom’s latest load shedding on the business community. The power utility will continue with Stage 2 load shedding on Thursday morning and said it was likely to continue for the rest of the week due to shortage of capacity. Jacobs says the country cannot afford additional constraints to an already burdened economy. He says any kind of uncertainty in power supply will deter investors and hurt the local economy. On Wednesday Eskom Acting Chief Executive Officer Jabu Mabuza said they understand the inconvenience that comes with load shedding, and has assured  South Africans that it is not the company’s objective to load shed.
