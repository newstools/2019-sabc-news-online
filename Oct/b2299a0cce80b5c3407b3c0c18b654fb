The City of Johannesburg has launched a forensic investigation into the Sandton Gautrain Station. The City says the company that bought the land on which the station has been built, never paid a cent of the R280 million purchase price. The City is currently at loggerheads with the land owners, Cedar Park. In a statement Mayor Herman Mashaba says they are exploring a number of options to recover the money. Mashaba seems to be going after Cedar Park which he calls a Gupta linked company. A few weeks ago the City shut down the water supply to the Sandton Gautrain Station over millions of rands in unpaid bills. Now the City says itâ€™s investigating how the previous administration got into an agreement which resulted in the company not paying anything for the land. Mashaba says he is looking at various options including opposing the business rescue application the company has made and supporting a liquidation application because he has been advised he cannot reverse the sale of the land.
