Seventy four people have been arrested for drunk driving over the weekend during the Arrive Alive Campaign in the Free State. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula took the Campaign to the Mangaung African Cultural Festival (Macufe) in Bloemfontein. The bulk of the arrests were made in the area where the Macufe Festival was being held. The National Department of Transport oversaw road blocks being manned by police. Motorists say they appreciate the intervention. “I am coming from Botshabelo, I’m very happy because I’m not drunk.  I feel very safe now as we go to Bloemfontein, seeing the traffic officers doing their jobs make us feel very safe.”   WATCH BELOW:
