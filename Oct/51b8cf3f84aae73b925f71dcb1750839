The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in KwaZulu-Natal has expressed shock at the killing of its uMsinga municipality councillor Khaya Sithole in the midlands. The party says Sithole was shot and killed by unknown men attending a municipal function. IFP Chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal Thamsanqa Ntuli says councillors in the province are the main victims of  brutal killings. Ntuli urged police to work around the clock in arresting those who killed Sithole “He was killed in front of the community and we received the news that when they were going for lunch some gunmen came and shot him and the other person who was part of the function to death. We are very concerned as the IFP because this is not the first incident where we see political leaders being killed in KwaZulu-Natal.”
