The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in Parliament has dismissed former secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana‘s allegations that his dismissal is unfair. Nehawu expressed surprise at Mgidlana’s decision to challenge his dismissal by Parliament. Both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) passed resolutions on Thursday to dismiss him after a disciplinary hearing. Mgidlana was found guilty of seven serious misconduct charges by an independent disciplinary panel which recommended his immediate dismissal. Union Chairperson in Parliament Sthembiso Tembe says “We are surprised that Mr. Mgidlana is deciding to challenge the decision of the two Houses. While we also respect his right to take whatever action if he feels that he is aggrieved, but we must remember that the decision of the two Houses is not the first decision that has gone against him. Firstly there was an audit. A parliament audit committee report found him guilty in almost all the charges. Then he went to the Cape Town High Court to try and challenge this. That challenge was dismissed with costs… and firstly, we need to find out whether he paid those costs or not, because we will be making a follow-up. If he did not pay those costs, he needs to pay up before he can even think of challenging his dismissal.”  Watch the video below for more:
