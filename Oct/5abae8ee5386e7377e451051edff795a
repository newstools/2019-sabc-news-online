The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) says it has received at least 95 applications country-wide for the cultivation of dagga for medicinal purposes. Stellenboch strawberry farm, Felbridge, is one of five that have been granted a licence for growing dagga for medicinal use only. SAHPRA’s head of the Names and Scheduling Unit, Momeena Omarjee says other sites are scheduled to undergo inspections. ” SAHPRA’s mandate only deals with cannabis for medicinal use and SAHPRA does not have mandate for non medicinal use of cannabis. The current cost is R23 980,00 for an application for cultivation for medicinal purposes.”
