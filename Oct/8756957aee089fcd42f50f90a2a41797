The Chief Whip of the Democratic Alliance (DA) John Steenhuisen has confirmed that his term of office has come to an end. This follows the resignation of former DA leader Mmusi Maimane on Wednesday and who on Thursday morning also resigned as DA MP. Steenhuisen has confirmed that his term is linked to that of the leader of the caucus.  In accordance with the rules of the party, the leader of the caucus must be elected among members of the party in Parliament. A meeting where the interim leader of the caucus will be elected will be held next week Tuesday.
