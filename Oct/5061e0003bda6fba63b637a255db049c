Athol Trollip has resigned as the Democratic Alliance’s federal chairperson during a media briefing at the DA’s headquarters in Bruma, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. Trollip says he has resigned as an act of accountability for the party’s poor performance during the national elections and for other leadership setbacks. “Having been the chairman of this party for four years that the less-than-spectacular result must be part of my responsibility. So, I accept that where the buck stops (is) at the leadership door. I was in one of those doors. There’s a time to come and a time to go in politics and I realise this weekend that it probably was my time to go and I’m happy to accept that.” Trollip had formerly served as Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.
