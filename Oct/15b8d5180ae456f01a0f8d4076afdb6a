The former Head of the Free State Agriculture Department, Peter Thabethe, will continue his testimony at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg on Friday. Heâ€™s giving evidence about his role in the controversial Vrede dairy farm project in the Free State. The R200 million project was meant to help emerging farmers, but large amounts of cash allegedly ended up in the hands of the Gupta family. On Thursday, Thabethe claimed that media reports about the infamous 2013 Waterkloof landing halted the potential of the Vrede project because Treasury stopped the injection of funds.
