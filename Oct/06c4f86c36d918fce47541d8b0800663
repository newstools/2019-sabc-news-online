Eastern Cape authorities say waste management projects are taking shape and could help create jobs while at the same time clean up the environment. Environmental affairs in the Eastern Cape has budgeted R17,9  million for six environmental projects this financial year. The Koukamma municipality is one of the beneficiaries with a R2,6 million rand clean-up and waste management project. “We chose Koukamma, because its important that if you have a tourism attraction like this, it must be clean. So that’s the importance of this, it encourages them, it also creates jobs, we don’t employ consultants or enterprises to come and do it we employ from each ward,” says Environmental Affairs MEC, Mlungisi Mvoko.
