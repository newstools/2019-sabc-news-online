Marchers against sanctions on Zimbabwe are calling the United States, European Union and Britain to lift sanctions with immediate effect. A group called “Coalition Against Sanctions” marched to the United States embassy in Pretoria. Marchers were joined by supporters of the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. The Coalition’s Director, Martha Shumba maintains that the sanctions are the reason the Zimbabwean economy has collapsed. “Sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by USA, EU and Britain are a poison poured into a communal well targeted to kill the headman and his chief.” “But the community is the one that suffers because the headman can drink bottled water. In a nutshell people are telling us that these sanctions are targeted on certain political leaders.” “They are targeted on certain entities but that is wrong’ it’s targeted on us as individuals.” Click video below:
