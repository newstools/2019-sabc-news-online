The Interim Provincial Committee of the African National Congress (ANC) in the North West is expected to announce its decision to dissolve a number of municipalities. More than half of the province’s municipalities are under administration. This is due to non-performance, political instability and financial challenges. “We will, at an appropriate time, explicitly express on the next course of action. I want to give an example with Mamusa. We have a debilitating state of governance in this municipality. Clearly there’s no value of money for ratepayers. The confidence of people in Mamusa has been eroded. The ANC had to act decisively against wrongdoing and we will do so,” says Spokesperson for the ANC Interim Provincial Committee, Kenny Morolong.
