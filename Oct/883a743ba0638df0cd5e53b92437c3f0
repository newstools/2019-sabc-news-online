Agri Western Cape has welcomed the R50 million emergency fund for drought-stricken farmers in the province. The relief funding was announced in the provincial legislature earlier Wednesday. CEO of Agri Western Cape, Jannie Strydom, says farmers in the Little Karoo, Central Karoo and Matzikama regions are battling with lucerne production. “In many areas there’s about a third of herds left, people had to sell off their stock just to have cash flow. In areas we found out that there’s job losses as a result of it and it could even be more; humanitarian crisis where the school fees can’t be paid, and in the Karoo region we found areas that if we get rain now it might take 5-10 years for some of those areas to recover from this drought.”
