Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says her department is expected to oversee the district development model that will boost projects at local level. President Cyril Ramaphosa first announced the district-based model in his third State of the Nation Address in June 2019. The aim of the model is to break down the silos between the different spheres of government, in a bid to improve the delivery of basic services in the 257 municipalities across the country. Speaking in Durban ahead of the launch of the model on Friday, Dlamini-Zuma said the model would enhance initiatives such as integrated development plans.  “Then we have a good profile of what each department and how much is being spent by government, not just by one sphere but by government in eThekwini, what infrastructure capital investment is being made available by government as a whole in eThekwini so there is better transparency about budget; so better monitoring when the plan is there and the budget is there. We will be able to see if it is being implemented and implemented properly and what the impact on the ground is.”
