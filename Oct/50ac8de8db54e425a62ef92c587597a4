The trial of the five men accused of killing actor and musician Dumi Masilela commences at the Pretoria High Court after it was postponed because one witness failed show up. Bongani Masombuka, Sfundo Nkosi, Khumbudzo Mukhuba, Brian Makhubedu and Mashudu Malema are facing charges including murder and hijacking. Masilela was shot during an attempted hijacking in Tembisa South and later died in hospital. One of the accused, Masombuka has accused police of assaulting him in an attempt to get a confession. He also claims to have suffered severe wounds on his wrists after he was ‘severely’ handcuffed by the police. However, warrant officer James Ratale stationed at Crystal Park in Benoni, and Colonel Moses Mbotho, who is stationed in Randburg, have refuted those claims and deny Masombuka’s version of events. Ratale told the court that the accused spent close to an hour with Mbotho being questioned. He said the accused never raised any discontentment from that engagement when driving back to Benoni. The trial continues. Click related video below:
