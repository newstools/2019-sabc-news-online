A fire at the building of pay TV Multichoice‘s headquarters in Randburg, Johannesburg, has been contained. Staff have been evacuated and no injuries have been reported. It’s understood the building was gutted after an air-conditioning system caught fire on Tuesday afternoon. Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson Nana Radebe, says, “Someone walked in at the station to say that there was a fire at Multichoice. We managed to come out with the team and they started with firefighting. We had seen that the fire was on top of the roof, and it was the air-conditioning system that was affected. It took plus minus 40 minutes to contain the fire, and ventilate the whole building.” It’s not yet clear what caused the blaze and no injuries have been reported.
