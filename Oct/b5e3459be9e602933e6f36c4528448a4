The United Front in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro says it’s determined to prevent the holding of a council meeting scheduled for Thursday to oust Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani. The party was addressing the media at its regional offices in Port Elizabeth where it pledged its support for Bobani and launched the ‘Save the Metro’ campaign. The United Front is part of the coalition government together with the African National Congress (ANC) and United Democratic Movement (UDM). The AIC is the only party that did not sign a petition to convene the special council meeting. One hundred and 17 councillors have signed the petition that has been sent to Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya. United Front PEC member Lungile Mxube says on Thursday they are going to the city hall. “Thursday, we can publicly confirm that we are going there to City Hall in masses. We are going to stop that Council Meeting on Thursday and we are not going to exchange roses. Because this is not a dinner party. It’s a revolution. If it means we must exchange with our bloods,  because we know they are going to call police dogs to intimidate us. It’s fine, they must kill us,” says Mxube.
