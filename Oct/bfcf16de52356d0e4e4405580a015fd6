Australian airline Qantas landed the world’s first ultra long-haul research flight in Sydney on Sunday after traveling 16,200 kilometres from New York. Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce told media that the flight was a historic event with recommendations to be put forward on how to manage pilot fatigue and passenger jet-lag. Fifty passengers and staff on board were fitted with EEG’s to monitor brainwave activity with checks on melatonin, so that data could be collected with aircraft to be developed to suit the needs of both passengers and staff. Joyce added that Qantas wanted to “get the product right” and were looking at four aircraft classes, with a special area for economy passengers to be able to exercise.
