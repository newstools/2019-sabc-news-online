The Association of Mineworkers & Construction Union (Amcu) has referred Sibanye-Stillwater mining company to the Commission of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) over wage negotiations and planned retrenchments. The union says it will fight against the planned retrenchments of 5 270 workers at the Sibanye-Stillwater’s newly-acquired Lonmin operations. AMCU’s President Joseph Mathunjwa says two executive directors at Sibanye-Stillwater received a combined total of R59 million in bonuses  before the start of wage negotiations. He says they are now claiming poverty while their 2018 and 2019 financials shows that the mines made a profit. “During the first 6 months of 2019 an unaudited 70 million dollars which might be translated to over R1.1 billion and this proves that Lonmin was indeed profitable when Sibanye-Stillwater swallowed it and Lonmin was indeed not a loss-making company.”
