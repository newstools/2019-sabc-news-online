Residents of Setlagole outside Mahikeng in the North West are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the high rate of teenage pregnancies in the area. Scores of girls, some as young as eleven, are dropping out of school. “We want to see those old men who are doing this taking responsibility. They must be prosecuted. As Setlagole Development Forum, we are going to make sure that these people are going to be prosecuted because they take advantage. They have money and the kids have nothing to eat, so they take advantage,” says one resident. “Magistrates are the problem. The police arrest the perpetrators, but magistrates set them free,”adds another resident. The provincial government has promised that the perpetrators of statutory rape will be brought to book. “If we don’t prosecute, it means as government whatever we do we won’t make any difference. I have also opened a case while I was here. There’s a 17 year- old who is pregnant who has been molested since she was 15 years,” says North West Social Development MEC, Boitumelo Moiloa.
