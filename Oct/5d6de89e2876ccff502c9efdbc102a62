Botswana‘s Independent Electoral Commission says the counting of parliamentary votes is progressing well. Counting has been completed in five of the 57 constituencies, where the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC)  and the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) have already registered victories. This year’s elections are believed to be the most highly-contested in the history of the country. Electoral Commission spokesperson Osupile Maroba says overall results, for both councils and parliamentary seats, will be released on Friday “Where we are now, we have five seats, already having two political parties ahead of the rest. We have two seats won by the BDP already, and three seats won by the UDC.” Watch video below for more on the elections:
