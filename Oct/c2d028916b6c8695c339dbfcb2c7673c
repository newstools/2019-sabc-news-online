Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has accused Duduzane Zuma of lying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture  and attempting to divert the attention away from himself. This after he testified on Monday, saying Madonsela had not granted him a fair opportunity to provide his version of events – in the manner in which Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas did. Jonas has previously testified that Zuma introduced him to the controversial Gupta family at their Saxonworld home in 2015. He claims that one of the Gupta brothers offered him the position of finance minister for R600 million. Former President Jacob Zuma’s son continues his testimony at the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday. Madonsela says Duduzane Zuma is attempting to use a dead-cat strategy: “What he told the commission is not true and he knows the truth. There is documentary evidence to the truth, but I don’t need to tell him that. He knows the truth. Why he told a non-truth to the commission, I don’t know. We call it a dead cat strategy, when there is an issue at the table, and he wants the conversation around the table, you introduce something else, and therefore attention is diverted. It has got nothing to do with the issue at hand. It is now about my conduct. It is called a dead cat strategy.”  Click link below:
