The Gauteng Education Department says despite a few glitches that load shedding caused, the majority of the grade 12 learners were able to write the Information Technology exam on Friday. Out of the 1 224 candidates who sat for the IT examination only nine could not write. The Department says this is a significant improvement compared to Wednesday when learners at 10 centres could not write or complete the Computer Applications technology exam due to load shedding. The Department’s Spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “Load-shedding was an impact on the nine candidates that could not write.  We also experienced some delays in other areas which we were able to overcome. We are actually happy as department that we are done with this process now.  We are looking forward to the 23th of October where everyone will be writing English.”  Click below to watch related video:
