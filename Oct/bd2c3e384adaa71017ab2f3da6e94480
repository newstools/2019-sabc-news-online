Nine people arrested for public violence in Boitumelong township in Bloemhof in the North West are expected to appear in the local magistrate’s court on Friday morning. Their arrest follows this week’s violent protest during which roads were barricaded and shops closed while close to 300 matric learners had to be evacuated from the township to write their exams at safer centres. Residents are demanding the release of twenty two suspects arrested for public violence, kidnapping and murder. The N12 linking Johannesburg and Cape Town remains closed for traffic. Authorities have urged motorists to use alternative roads. Residents have blockaded the road since Monday. Click below to watch video:
