Political Analyst, Ralph Mathekga, says the election of Helen Zille – as the Democratic Alliance’s Federal Council Chairperson – could deal a major blow to party leader Mmusi Maimane‘s hopes to both finish his term in 2021. Zille beat Athol Trollip, Thomas Walters and Mike Waters in the highly-contested position on Sunday.

Mathekga says there is a possibility of Zille overwhelming Maimane’s leadership. “It is very difficult for Mmusi to finish his term. Remember when Zille came about, there were those who were saying there were those thinking about the leadership of the DA beyond Maimane. The same people who have supported Zille and saw her succeed means there might be a follow-through of having to let go of Maimane. Maimane is clearly holding on to his political idea and I think the mere fact that Zille has to make a point that she will stay in her lane is of a possible tension that exists. There is no way that she will be able to stick within her lane.” [ON NOW] Political analyst Prince Mashele on the election of #HelenZille as the chairperson of the DA’s Federal Council yesterday.
