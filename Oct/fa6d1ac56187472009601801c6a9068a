African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has called for a speedy revival of the party’s youth wing. Magashule says the mother body needs a militant youth wing to drive Radical Economic Transformation. He was addressing an ANC Youth League mini rally in Hammanskraal, Pretoria north. ANC youth structures in Tshwane are on a campaign to rebuild the dormant ANC Youth League. A rare mini-rally was organised and addressed by the mother body’s Secretary General Ace Magashule. In a wide-ranging speech Magashule says the ANC Youth League can regain relevance if properly reformed. He says the ANC needs its youth wing and that the youth league must elect its own leaders. Magashule says there are no permanent party leaders. “Even myself, as Secretary General, I have no ambition to stay. A young leader must take over.” ANC youth structures in Tshwane agree that the ANC cannot continue to exist without an effective youth wing. Unemployment and lack of opportunities are concerning to youth leaders. “Young people in Tshwane are suffering because we are taking policy decisions that are market sensitive,” says ANC Tshwane Youth League Lesego Makhubela. The National ANC Youth League structures were dissolved earlier in 2019. A National Youth Task Team has since been established to take the youth league to a successful elective conference early 2020.
