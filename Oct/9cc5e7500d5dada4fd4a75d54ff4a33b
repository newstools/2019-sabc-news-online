Armed suspects have robbed the Post office in Somerset West of an undisclosed amount of cash. Police spokesperson, FC Van Wyk, says two suspects entered the Post Office and pointed firearms at staff and demanded money from the safe. Officers pursued the suspects to Baden Powell Drive where they managed to stop the vehicle and arrested one of the suspects. Two other suspects fled on foot and are being sought. Van Wyk says the getaway vehicle was reported as hijacked in Kwanobuhle in the Eastern Cape in August this year.
