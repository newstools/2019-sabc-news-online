The City of Cape Town says several informal settlements are under water following the heavy rains over the past two days in parts of the Western Cape. They include Masiphumelele in Fish Hoek, Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, and Nomzamo in the Strand. The average rainfall in Cape Town during October is 30 millimetres. Kenilworth and Kirstenbosch have recorded more than 100 millimetres of rain this week. More rain is expected Sunday. The City’s Charlotte Powell says storm-related electricity disruptions are also being experienced in Gugulethu and Elsies River. “These areas have been assessed by the Disaster Risk Management officials and no emergency sheltering was required. Except for two settlements in Mfuleni where 240 dwellings were water logged and emergency sheltering was activated. SASSA has been informed to provide humanitarian relief. Various roadways across the City have been reported flooded and Transport Management are continuing to clear roadways and unblock drains.”
