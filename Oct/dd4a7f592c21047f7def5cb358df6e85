Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari kick-starts his State Visit to South Africa at the Union Buildings in Pretoria later on Thursday morning amid continued concerns about attacks on foreigners in South Africa. Buhari will co-chair the 9th SA-Nigeria Bi-national Commission with President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria. Relations between Africa’s largest economies have always had some turbulence. In 2015, Nigeria withdrew its ambassador to South Africa following attacks on foreign nationals. Again last month in another spate of attacks on foreign nationals in the county, several businesses belonging to Nigerians accused of dealing in drugs were torched resulting in retaliatory attacks on South African businesses in Nigeria. However, Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama says they have welcomed South Africa’s apology following the attacks. The two leaders will also focus on improving economic ties between the two nations. Watch video below:
