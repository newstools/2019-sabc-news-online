Former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) COO Chris Maroleng who was fired earlier this year is taking the public broadcaster to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in Johannesburg. The SABC board terminated Maroleng’s contract in April 2019, after acting on the findings and recommendations of a disciplinary process, which found Maroleng guilty on three charges related to gross negligence. Maroleng is expected to argue that his dismissal in April was unfair and wants to be compensated for his loss. According to the disciplinary report, Maroleng was found guilty of breaching his fiduciary duties as a director after allegedly writing a recommendation letter for a former employee who left the institution under a cloud of suspicion. The CCMA’s matter is running parallel to a Labour Court application Maroleng made in September against the SABC in which he is demanding the court to declare his dismissal unlawful and be set aside.
