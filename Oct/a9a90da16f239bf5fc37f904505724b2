A KwaZulu-Natal private school that prides itself on its “Christian ethos” has come under fire from parents and the Christian community after allowing a matric pupil to display several works of art that mock Jesus as a clown. A video made by an angry parent of a pupil at Grantleigh School near Richards Bay went viral on social media and caused a massive backlash against the school. The exhibition has infuriated Christians. Elijah’s Mantle Ministry, Reverend Thami Mahlaba says, “We are not surprised as such because there’s been so much of hatred against God and against Christianity, so if what is right is hated it doesn’t mean that it can be any wrong. Even Jesus warned us and said the world is gonna hate you, so it’s a continuation other anti-Christ and also haters against our Lord.” Watch video below made by the disgruntled parent.
