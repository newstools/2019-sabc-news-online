President Ramaphosa makes oral replies in Parliament. Among others, the leader of the opposition John Steenhuisen wants to know about the current status of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s proposed new economy recovery plan and when it will be brought before cabinet for a decision. The leader of the ACDP, Kenneth Meshoe, wants details on how the one-point-one billion rand that was set aside for the fight against gender based violence will be administered. The President appears in Parliament every quarter to answer oral questions, as one of the legislature’s ways to keep the Executive accountable.
