Democratic Alliance (DA) Spokesperson Solly Malatsi says a Review panel report has been handed to the party, and members will start to deliberate on it shortly. DA Chief Executive Paul Boughey resigned after the report recommended that he, and party leader Mmusi Maimane, step aside. The report was compiled by former party leader Tony Leon and former party chief strategist Ryan Coetzee, as well as Capitec founder Michiel le Roux. The recommendation was made after the DA’s poor showing in the May national and provincial elections. “The discussion on the report is not concluded, so the panel made a presentation and it’s still going to be discussed… and it will become part of the report which we’ll present to you at the end of this briefing. So we’ll have an opportunity about the actual review and resolutions adopted in response to the actual review,” says Malatsi. Watch the full briefing by DA Spokesperson Solly Malatsi below:
