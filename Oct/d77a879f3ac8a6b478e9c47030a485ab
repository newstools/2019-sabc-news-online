An off-duty Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officer has been arrested for murder after he allegedly shot and killed a motorist in Cosmo City, north of Johannesburg, on Thursday. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says the arrested officer was involved in an altercation with the motorist when he took out his service pistol and fired multiple times at the motorist. “The off duty officer, who was driving a white Golf, made a U-turn and allegedly nearly collided with a blue Nissan Almera. The driver of the blue Almera chased behind the Golf and there were words exchanged and the occupants of the Almera tried to disarm the off duty officer.  That’s when the officer shot the Almera multiple times,” says Minnaar.
