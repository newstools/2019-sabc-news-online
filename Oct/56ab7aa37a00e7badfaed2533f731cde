South Africa’s unemployment has worsened. The figures Statistics South Africa has released for the third quarter show that it has risen to 29.1% – the highest level in 11 years. This is compared to 29%in the second quarter. The total number of unemployed people in South Africa remained unchanged in the third quarter – at 6.7 million. Economist Laura Campbell says unemployment remains high due to low business confidence and low economic growth. “Undoubtedly, the fact that business confidence remains low, it will have an effect on decisions by employers to take on more workers in the period. We did see 62 000 jobs created on a quarter on quarter basis, but it’s unlikely that this will be sustained going forward until such a time people see structural reforms being undertaken in the economy.”  Watch the video below for more on the story:  See infographic below for more:
