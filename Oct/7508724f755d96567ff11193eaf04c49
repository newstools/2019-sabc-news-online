Botswana’s ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) says it will leave nothing to chance to retain power in the upcoming elections. The BDP which has governed the country since its independence in 1966, has faced fierce challenges from the opposition this year, after breaking ranks with its former leader Ian Khama. During the 2014 election the opposition Umbrella For Democratic Change (UDC) won 20 seats in the 57 seat parliament, a first for Botswana politics. The BDP’s Tumisang Healy said diversification of the economy and the amendment of the Land Tenure Act, are some of the party’s key priorities. Healy says, “The land tenure laws have been very strict – but now they have been loosened up a lot. Now you can use up to 50% of your ploughing fields for different purposes without necessarily having to go through the tedious processes of changing land use and all that.” WATCH BELOW:
