The visit is part of a larger initiative to protect the oceans and fight climate change. The expedition will also document local bio-diversity.  Ship is open to visitors The voyage forms part of Greenpeace’s Pole to Pole ship tour aimed at rallying support for a Global Oceans UN treaty to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. Greenpeace deputy project leader, Rianke Krugel encouraged people to visit their open boat this coming weekend to learn about the work they do with the UN. On Friday, a group of the climate youth leaders from Africa will board the ship. They will share ideas on how to deal with issues affecting climate and the oceans. Krugel says the oceans are currently under a great deal of stress. “It’s not just one thing, it’s not just over-fishing; it’s plastic marine pollution, it is oil, drilling, deep sea mining. It’s a whole collection of threats facing the oceans and the oceans are suffering, but the oceans also have the potential to regenerate.” The ship is open to the public this weekend after which it will depart on a three-week expedition to Vema Seamount. It’s situated in the South Atlantic about 1 000km northwest of Cape Town.
