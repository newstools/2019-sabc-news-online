The Southern African Development Community’s (SADC) Electoral Advisory Council has expressed confidence that Mozambique is ready to conduct its elections, scheduled for October 15. The SADC Electoral Observer Mission is to be launched in Mozambique on Monday. The Mission is led by Zimbabwe’s Minister for Defence and War Veterans, Oppah Muchingiri-Khashiri. The Mission working with other stakeholders will ensure that the presidential and provincial elections are free and fair. It will also ensure that all SADC and Mozambique’s laws governing elections are followed. The elections will be observed on a three-phase approach, before they start, the election day and after the elections.
