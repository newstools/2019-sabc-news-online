Comair says it expects its full fleet to be back in operation by Wednesday after the Civil Aviation Authority grounded some Comair and SAA planes amid concerns about maintenance. The CAA issued a verification notice related to irregular findings picked up during a recent audit of South African Airways Technical – which does maintenance on the planes. Deen Gielink, an executive manager in flight operations at Comair, says: “We are expecting our full fleet to be back in operation Wednesday morning and we will be running our normal schedule from October 23rd. We would like to thank our customers and other stakeholders for their continued support and understanding.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
