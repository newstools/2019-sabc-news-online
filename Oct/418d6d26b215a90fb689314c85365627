The Bloodhound Landspeed record car is finally in South Africa. The car made the 5000 kilometre journey from the United Kingdom to the Northern Capeâ€™s Kalahari by sea, air and road. Engineers are putting the car together and hope to begin tests on it this coming week. The Bloodhound aims to break the land speed record by travelling at a speed of 1,600 kilometres an hour. It is, after all, powered by a jet engine. Watch video report below:
