Botswana’s main opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) has cast doubt on the credibility of the country’s Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). This comes only hours before the announcement of election results. The UDC alleges that there were irregularities and duplication of the voters’ roll in Wednesday’s general elections. UDC spokesperson Moeti Mohwasa says the party may consider challenging the outcome of the elections. “Voters’ rolls didn’t have correct information about the voters. In some instances there were reports of two versions or more of the voters’ roll. The voters’ registration details were mis-allocated.” The IEC has dismissed the UDC’s allegations saying they are aimed at bringing the electoral body into disrepute. “If it occurs that you have multiple registrations or duplicates you would only use the one that is valid and the rest would be rejected. There is no way that you can have  two correct registration records in one voters’ roll, that is not possible.” Click below for more on the story:
