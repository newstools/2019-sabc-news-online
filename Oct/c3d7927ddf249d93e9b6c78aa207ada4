A 39 year old security guard at a school in Port Shepstone has been arrested for allegedly stealing twenty tablets from a school on the south coast of KwaZulu Natal South Coast. The burglary happened during the school holidays and the principal laid a burglary charge with the police when schools reopened this week. The guard is due to appear in the Port Shepstone Magistrates Court on Thursday. KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson Thulani Zwane said officers went to the home of the security guard and allegedly found 6 of the stolen tablets. Zwane says he was arrested by the Port Shepstone police after they reacted to a complaint that he might be involved in a burglary at a school. The police went to his house and when they searched his house they found the tablets from him and he was then charged for burglary. “It is alleged the principal came to his school on Tuseday as the schools were re-opening  and he noticed that there were 20 tablets that were stolen from the school. She opened a case of burglary and the security guard was the last person working at the school,” added Zwane.
