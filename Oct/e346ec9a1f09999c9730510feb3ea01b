The trial of four men accused of killing former ANC Youth League Secretary General Sindiso Magaqa is expected to start on Monday at the High Court sitting in Scottburgh on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal. The decision was made by the Director of Public Prosecution in July as the matter was heard at the Umzimkhulu Regional Court. The four suspects include two former police officers, along with Harry Gwala district Municipality mayor Mluleki Ndobe and Umzimkhulu municipal manager Zweliphansi Skhosana whose charges were provisionally withdrawn due to insufficient evidence. They face one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder of two female councillors who had sustained gunshot wounds on the day of the attack. Magaqa’s brother, Lwazi says the family hopes justice will prevail. “As a family we are happy that the accused are behind bars. We are happy that the case will start. But the problem is his mother. She has not accepted it. She cries so much whenever we speak about our brother, her son Sindiso. We hope that the State will do Justice.”
