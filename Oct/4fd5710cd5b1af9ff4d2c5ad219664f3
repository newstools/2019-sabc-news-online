The Mineral Resources and Energy Department says it is committed to achieving universal electrification by 2025. It says the country is currently at 83% coverage compared to 30% in 1991. The department was briefing Parliament on the Integrated National Electrification Programme. Chief Director for Electricity Jacob Mbele says they are facing a number of problems which include the mushrooming of informal settlements and a lack of technical capacity in municipalities. “We’ve also seen projects that get stopped because some of the community members interfere demanding, obviously, to be part of the projects and that affects progress. In most urban areas, the challenge that we see is that sometimes before houses can be completed these houses are occupied, which is the illegal occupation of houses and then the program is not able to obviously complete electrification as planned.”
