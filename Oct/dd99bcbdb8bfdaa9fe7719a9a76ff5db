Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says he has not spoken to Helen Zille regarding her candidacy for the position of chairperson of the party’s Federal Council. Zille announced her candidacy against former Nelson Mandela Metro Mayor Athol Trollip and members of the National Assembly, Mike Waters and Thomas Walters. The election will take place towards the end of October at the Federal Council meeting. Zille says if she is elected, she will move the party forward and ensure it is ready to successfully compete in the 2021 municipal elections. Maimane says he will allow the party’s democratic processes to take place and the candidate who wins will ultimately advance the party’s vision of creating one South Africa for all. “We have four candidates standing for the position. My job is not to pronounce on any of the candidates and I think ultimately we want a candidate who will win and enhance that vision, that’s what is important. It’s not for me to pronounce what happens after she’s won. She has the right to stand. The congress will decide, the council will decide and then we will pronounce on that. I haven’t spoken to Helen Zille – from the last, she was at the Institute of Race Relations,” says Maimane. Watch a related video below:
