Shark safety and research organisation Shark Spotters says there could be various reasons for the disappearance of Great White Sharks from False Bay. Over the last 18 months, there has been a significant decline of shark sightings in the area. In previous years, there’s been an average of 250 shark sightings a year. There have been no confirmed Great White Shark sightings in 2019. As part of Marine Week which kicked off on Monday, the aquarium will host the Fifth Southern African Shark and Ray Symposium. The symposium is designed for scientists and researchers who specialise in sharks and are experts in marine ecology to share their knowledge. Meanwhile, the Two Oceans Aquarium says it has calculated that more than 11 000 sharks are killed hourly in the world. Curator at the Two Oceans Aquarium Maryke Musson says: “Worldwide and South Africa, sharks are in dire need of protection. People tend to be very fearful of sharks but we really need to fear losing sharks. We have calculated that every hour, more than 11 000 sharks are killed in the world, which is insane. So the more awareness we can create and the more people we can convince to care about sharks, the better for sharks who are of course top predators in the ocean. So they need to maintain this balance in this ecosystem that covers 70% of our planet.”
