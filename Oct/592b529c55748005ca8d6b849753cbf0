The African National Congress in Gauteng says it remains committed to finding alternative ways of funding road infrastructure that does not overburden citizens. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced in his Medium Term Budget policy statement on Wednesday that the Gauteng e-tolls are here to stay, adding that South Africa needs to embrace a culture of payment. Gauteng province and national government have been at logger heads over the funding model for the e-tolls. Gauteng ANC spokesperson Bones Modise says: “We welcome the fact that after considering several options to resolve the impasse around e-tolls, cabinet has committed to a reconfigured approach to the GFIP.” “The ANC Gauteng Province remains committed to finding alternative ways of funding the improvement of our road infrastructure in a manner that does not overburden the citizen of this province.” Click video below:
