Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says the proposed business model for Eskom as outlined in the special paper, has a clear implementation plan. He says the paper provisions for a just transition that incorporates a future for workers and communities. He says the paper also makes proposals on how governance will be restored and how procurement will be handled going forward. Gordhan says the debt aspect of Eskom and how that will be managed will be outlined by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni when he tables his Mid-Term Budget Statement on Wednesday. Gordhan was presenting the Special Paper on Eskom in Pretoria. “So, we’ve got a plan for the next two months and for the next year. So, there’s clear implementation plan. Implementation machinery will be created.” Gordhan says while establishing the Transmission Entity is the keystone to Eskom’s reform, the entity will require adherence to legal process and changes to the legislation by government. He says the procurement of new energy will remain with the Department of Energy. Gordhan says the buying of newly-procured energy will be done within the Transmission Entity. “What we’re talking about is going to happen within the current legislative framework, and then we’ll begin to look at how a legal transformation occurs, and we’ve got legal advice on how we can work within the current framework and where legislative changes are necessary you’ll get to hear about them. But they don’t have to happen until anywhere near the first quarter of next year.”  Watch the video below for more on the story:   Read: The Roadmap for Eskom, below:
