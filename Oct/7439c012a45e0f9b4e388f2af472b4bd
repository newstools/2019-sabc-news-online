Municipal workers union, Samwu wants the City of Johannesburg to pay its members’ subscription fees into the unions account. Samwu accuses the metro municipality of keeping the money in an attempt to collapse the union. Hundreds of Samwu members gathered outside the municipality offices in Braamfontein, central Johannesburg, where they’ve handed over a memorandum of demands. “We are not disputing any payments; and so far there will be continued engagement between us and leadership of Samwu.  There’s a lot of squabbles – in between where we cannot agree, where the money should be going. As the City, we’ve placed the money in what we call suspense account, ” says Chief Operations Officer in the City of Johannesburg, Mike Brinks.
