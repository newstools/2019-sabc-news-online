The Auditor General’s office says the percentage of audits it was able to complete has decreased from 94% in 2014-15 to 85% in 2018-19. This was revealed by the office when it briefed Parliament on its annual report. The Office of the Auditor-General has signed off on over 1000 audits for the financial year under review. Deputy Auditor-General, Tsakani Ratsela says this is due to contestation of audit outcomes by some government entities – among other things. Ratsela says the quality of financial records they are expected to audit is another factor. “Quite often when we arrive, the quality of financials that are submitted to us is such that the readiness of that entity to audit is not quite right. So there is a long period of adjustments, so the version of financials we receive on the 31st of May is different from what we see on the 31st of July… that delays the audits. Many of the audits are delayed by that.”
