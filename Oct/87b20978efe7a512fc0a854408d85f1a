Former Crime Intelligence official, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo says he believes that at least R5 million in salaries, vehicles and hiring houses, was spent on the seven former spy boss, Richard Mdluli’s family members, unduly appointed to the unit. Naidoo, who is in witness protection, is testifying at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johanneburg through an audio link from a secret location about the looting of millions meant for intelligence work, during Mdluli’s tenure. On Monday he told the inquiry that 250 posts were created to benefit families and friends of Mdluli and head of finance Solomom Lazarus. Naidoo says two of the seven Mdluli family members spent most of the time shopping or at home. “I had to deal with FM28 & FM27 regarding the payment of salaries and reconciling their petrol claims or just to visit them at the office. In most of the occasions there would not be in the office chair, they would either be at home or at the mall shopping I know this because when I would phone them they would tell me that they are at the mall or at home.” Watch for more:
