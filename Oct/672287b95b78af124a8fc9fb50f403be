Child rapist Nicholas Ninow‘s name will be included in the Sexual Offenders Register.  Ninow was handed life imprisonment on Thursday for raping a seven-year-old girl at Dros restaurant bathroom in Silverton east of Pretoria in September last year. Ninow, who was 20 years -old at the time of the offence, pleaded guilty to the charges but threatened to commit suicide if the court sent him to jail for life. The High Court in Pretoria says Ninow, showed no remorse for his crimes. Judge Mokhine Mosopa says there is a difference between remorse and regret, ” the accused wrote a poem to the complainant a letter to her family asking for forgiveness to me that is not remorse but regret, as accused, is aware that he’s facing a prospect of a lengthy-term in prison. Its my considered view that the accused failed to show the existence of substantial and compelling circumstances. Meanwhile, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the sentence NPA spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane,  says she believes the court was justified in handing down a life sentence.
