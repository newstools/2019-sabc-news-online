President Cyril Ramaphosa has appealed to members of the international community to work together to strengthen multilateral institutions. He was addressing ambassadors and heads of mission-designate who handed their credential letters to him from their respective leaders during an event at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria…  The President’s appeal comes at a time when the United Nations is struggling financially and countries such as the US have become increasingly inward-looking in their approach to international relations. “We must work together to defend the integrity of our multilateral institutions by ensuring that they are both effective, inclusive as well as truly democratic. We must strengthen these institutions because they are best placed to drive solutions to some of the stubborn challenges that we are facing as a global community” The President touched on the violence that has sporadically rocked South African townships and towns in recent years, saying a lasting solution must be found to the problems that migration has caused… “For decades South Africans have lived peacefully with people from around the world, particularly the African continent, sharing resources, learning from one another deepening our multi-culturalism. We have a responsibility as leaders to understand the realities of international migration and put in place fair sustainable and rights based policies to manage it”
