The small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) in the Nelson Mandela Bay say they are concerned about the deepening power struggles in the metro. In the latest development, Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya cancelled a meeting to debate a motion of no-confidence in Mayor Mongameli Bobani at the 11th hour, citing security reasons. The SMME’S are still waiting for the R486 million that Bobani promised them over three years. Entrepreneur Mkhululi Magada says a lack of progress in the council is affecting their businesses. “The agreement that was signed by the mayor was a follow up of a meeting that we had two months ago. Even before the turmoil that is happening in the metro, and the SMMEs still cling on that, making a follow up on what the coalition government had agreed. Remember I’m choosing my words correctly, I’m saying the coalition government but not the mayor, because the meeting that we had, all the political parties were there and that is where they confirmed their support to the SMMEs,” says Magada. There have also been concerns about the letter from Treasury giving the metro two weeks to return R3 billion that was allocated for the Integrated Public Transport System, due to non-compliance. Opposition parties say this could bankrupt the municipality. Meanwhile, Political Analyst Joleen Steyn-Kotze says due to its instability, the council has become what he calls a political theatre. “Now what we see of course is that the ANC has no outright majority, neither the DA has. So the political dynamic is very reliant on smaller parties co-operating with the larger political parties… if that co-operation is not there… And if you see these political battles played out, decisions can’t be taken and budgets can’t be passed… and citizens will ultimately suffer,” says Steyn-Kotze.
