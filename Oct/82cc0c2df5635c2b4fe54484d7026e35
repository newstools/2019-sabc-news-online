The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has confirmed that it recognises the Mzwanele Nyhontso faction of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), this follows internal party leadership squabbles that saw the party heading to the courts in a bid to resolve the issue. IEC CEO Sy Mamabolo says after lengthy investigations, the commission has concluded that Narius Moloto is not the legitimate leader of the PAC. He says the IEC followed all its legal processes to arrive at the conclusion. “That’s where we are, based on those court judges, which of course as the lawful body we can’t ignore but act on them. We have then taken this decision and we hope that the progesterone within the party will have a period of peace, a period of tranquility so that the PAC can focus on its political programs as a political party,” adds Mamabolo. Meanwhile, PAC secretary-general Apa Pooe has called on all members of the party to unite. The party has welcomed the decision by the IEC to recognise Mzwanele Nhyontso as the legitimate leader of the party. This follows internal leadership squabbles that saw the formation of two factions, one loyal to Nyhontso and other to Narius Moloto. Pooe says they will be holding a strategy-planning conference to discuss ways of uniting the party. “We are calling on all members of the PAC those who may have left the organisation because of the so-called infighting to come back home. The PAC is now a united single organisation. We are calling on all others who may have supported the former expelled leader Narius Moloto to also come on board and become part of a moving PAC. As the national executive council we’ll also be holding a strategic retreat wherein we will develop strategies on how do we make sure that this perception that has always been there that we are a divided party that we deal with it once and for all.” Watch PAC reaction below for more:
