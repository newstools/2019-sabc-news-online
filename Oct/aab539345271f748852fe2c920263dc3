A grade eleven learner who was stabbed to death outside Eastwood Secondary School in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal will be buried on Saturday. Hershelle Fynn 18, was killed allegedly by a fellow learner after he intervened in a bullying incident. Fynn has been hailed as a hero by fellow learners. Three other learners were stabbed in the fight that claimed Fynn’s life; one is still in hospital in a critical condition. Meanwhile a 24 year old University of KwaZulu Natal student is also being laid to rest in Pietermaritzburg. Simukelo Zondi’s badly burnt body was discovered in the bushes at Westville campus in Durban last week. Zondi had been reported missing by his girlfriend on October 10, 2019. He had allegedly been lured into a bush by his roommate who then killed him and set his body alight with paraffin. Security guards at the University, who rushed to put out the fire, reportedly saw the suspect emerging from the bushes and apprehended him. The suspect has since appeared in court on charges of murder.
