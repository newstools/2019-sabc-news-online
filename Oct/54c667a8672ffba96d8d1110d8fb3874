President Cyril Ramaphosa says the district development model will provide a streamlined and well-co-ordinated approach between government departments and municipalities when responding to a multitude of development needs of communities. He was addressing African National Congress (ANC) branches in eThekwini ahead of the launch of the new model in KwaMashu north of Durban on Friday. Ramaphosa says the new model will enable the government departments that work with municipalities to focus on all development challenges in a particular district. “This model, comrades, is to integrate everything that we are doing – and it forces us to cooperate, and we cooperate around something that is quite specific, so that everybody can see that these are challenges, the needs and these are the steps that we must take to address those needs,” the President adds.
