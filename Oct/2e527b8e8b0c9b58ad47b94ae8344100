The court case of former President Jacob Zuma and co-accused French arms company, Thales, has been postponed in the Pietermaritzburg High Court until the 4th of February next year. Last Friday, the court dismissed their application for a permanent stay of prosecution. It is not yet clear if Zuma and Thales intend to appeal against last week’s ruling. Judge Jerome Mnguni said the court found that the seriousness of the charges Zuma is facing outweighs any prejudice – which he claims he will suffer if the trial proceeded. Zuma and Thales are facing charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering linked to the multi-billion rand Arms deal in 1999. The judges also found that Zuma did not suffer any prejudice by not being charged together with his former financial adviser Shabir Shaik as his legal team argued. Shaik was convicted of fraud and corruption in 2005 and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.  Watch video below:
