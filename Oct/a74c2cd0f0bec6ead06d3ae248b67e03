A South African start-up has launched the first globally recognised private online high school in the country. Valenture Institute will begin its first year of curriculum in January 2020 and will provide learners worldwide with a fully supported, global online high schooling experience. Founder Rob Paddock says the curriculum is based on the British curriculum and contains normal high school subjects as well as new initiatives such as courses based on the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals. Paddock says, “What we have created is an incredible socially rich online learning experience where students are interacting with each other and their teachers in real time. We are offering the equivalent of Grades 8 through to 12 plus a post matric which is the British curriculum.” “We have taken a strong focus on the UN sustainable development goals and we have integrated those into the curriculum encouraging students to get together in person – in their local geographies to work together to solve the world’s biggest problems,” added Paddock.
