Eskom is threatening to cut off electricity to the Emfuleni Local Municipality in the Vaal due to the R1.7 billion it owes to the power utility. In 2018, the Gauteng government took over the running of the municipality’s finances due to its deteriorating state. Now the Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will table a motion during next Thursday’s council sitting for the municipality to be placed under full administration. In a letter, Eskom says Emfuleni municipality has failed to pay its electricity account despite numerous demands and that it continues to charge, collect and receive money from its customers for electricity supplied. Eskom is threatening to cut off electricity with effect from Wednesday next week. The DA Emfuleni’s Daddy Mollo says this would have serious consequences: “Especially the business. You can imagine if the business is affected this will affect people employed in those businesses. You can imagine without electricity what’s going to happen.” Emfuleni Mayoral Spokesperson Lebo Mofokeng says the mayor and his senior officials are meeting currently and will be communicating their response soon.
