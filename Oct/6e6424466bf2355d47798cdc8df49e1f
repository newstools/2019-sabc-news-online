The State Capture Commission of Inquiry is on Wednesday expected to hear an application by former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane, to cross examine Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan. Former Crime Intelligence officer, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo is also expected to conclude his testimony about the looting of millions of rands meant for intelligence work, during the tenure of former crime intelligence boss, Richard Mdluli. He has been testifying through an audio link from a secret location since last Friday. On Tuesday Naidoo implicated another cabinet minister in the looting of the unit’s slush fund. He says: “A Mercedes Benz ML350, was purchased at Mercedes Benz Mhlanga Rocks probably between 2009 or 2010. The vehicle was specifically purchased for the use by then Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa. The minister utilised the vehicle for a few months.” “I remember this because General Mdluli instructed me to pick up the vehicle from the minister’s house as the minister informed him that he no longer wants to use the vehicle because journalists were following him.”
