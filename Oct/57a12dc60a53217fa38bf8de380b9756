The Hawks have made contact with the Office of the Chief Justice about investigations into alleged corruption in the judiciary. This has been revealed by the Secretary General of the Office of the Chief Justice Meme Sejosengwe. She responded to questions in the Justice and Correctional Services Committee in Parliament. Sejosengwe and various officials from the Office of the Chief Justice appeared before the Committee to brief it about the OCJ’s (Office of the Chief Justice) 2018/2019 annual report. Allegations of corruption in the judiciary recently surfaced in the public domain and on social media, prompting Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to call on anyone with information of alleged corruption to bring it forward to his office. “The question around the SAPS (South African Police Service) and the Hawks investigation with regards to allegations of corruption against the judiciary … just to confirm what the Chief Justice was saying, SAPS has responded to the matter to say that the Hawks have been assigned to investigate. They have already established contact with the OCJ (Office of the Chief Justice) with regards to information that they might need – as we have indicated that some of the information is with us – then we can provide to them. So, that is the progress with regard to that matter,” says Sejosengwe. Watch video below for more on the story:
