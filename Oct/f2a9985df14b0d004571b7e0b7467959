The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has retained its ward 9 following the by-election held on Wednesday at Mhlathuze on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. The ward was vacant after the resignation of the councillor. The ANC, Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and an Independent candidate are among the political parties that contested the by-election. KwaZulu-Natal IEC spokesperson Thule Dlamini says they are happy with the process as there were no incidents of disturbance reported and the new councillor is Mandla Mtaka. “Of the 6321 registered votes, 2029 voters were able to vote yesterday. The ANC was also able to retain the ward with 1007 votes. DA got 326 votes, EFF 23 votes, IFP 551 votes and followed by Independent candidate with 112 votes,” explains Dlamini.
