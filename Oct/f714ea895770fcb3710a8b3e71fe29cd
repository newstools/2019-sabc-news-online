Government has joined political parties and non-governmental organisations in welcoming the life sentence that the High Court in Pretoria has handed to a child rapist Nicholas Ninow. He was also given five years for possession of drugs and another five years for defeating the ends of justice. The life sentence and defeating the ends of justice will run concurrently. Judge Mokhine Mosopa also ordered that Ninow’s name should be included in the Sexual Offenders’ Register. Ninow raped a seven-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Pretoria in September last year. Judge Mosopa said he did not show any remorse. “The accused wrote a poem to the complainant, a letter to her family asking for forgiveness, to me that is not remorse but regret as the accused is aware that he’s facing a prospect of a lengthy term in prison. It’s my considered view that the accused failed to show the existence of substantial and compelling circumstances.”  Click below for related content:
