Eskom says it has issued court papers and filed an affidavit against Deloitte Consulting in an attempt to recover over R200 million. It has also filed papers against former Eskom CFO Anoj Singh and former senior executive Prish Govender. Eskom says it believes contracts were irregularly awarded to Deloitt in 2016.
