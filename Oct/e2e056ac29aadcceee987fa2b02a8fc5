Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi has called on citizens who have registered to vote to exercise their right to vote. Masisi voted in his home village, Moshupa, outside the capital Gaborone. He says his country prides itself on being a peaceful place, adding that he does not anticipate any glitches during the elections. “Botswana has got a reputation for calmness, predictability in terms of conduct, stability. And it’s my firm belief as I’ve been informed that, that’s going on pretty well. I will hope people would bring themselves off the heat. As I’ve asked you to drink lots of water, wait patiently on the line, and cast their votes. This is the only time in five years, generally speaking, when we go for general election, that they get an opportunity to vote for a government of their choice.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
