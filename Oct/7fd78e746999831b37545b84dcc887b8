About 700 University of Johannesburg (UJ) employees are expected to embark on an indefinite strike action in all campuses from Friday morning. The strike involves security personnel, support staff and cleaners.  The strike led by labour union, NUMSA, is over issues relating to salaries and medical aid. The university says it expects operations to continue uninterrupted. UJ says while it recognises the workers right to strike, the principle of no work, no pay will apply. NUMSA spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says, “There are employees in the security department who are earning lower salaries than some of their colleagues even though they do the same work, this is because the grading system is unfair.” “As NUMSA we are demanding it be overhauled immediately. The management of protection services forces our members to do extra work without paying them. This is rampant exploitation and must end.  We demand that all workers must be on the same medical aid with the same benefits.”
