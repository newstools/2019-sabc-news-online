Gauteng MEC for Public Transport and Road Infrastructure, Jacob Mamabolo has urged the church to be at the centre of road safety. Speaking at the prayer service for road safety in Naledi, Soweto on Sunday, Mamabolo said gospel choirs and indigenous churches should use their structures to spread the message of responsible driving. “Government has been missing out on a very critical section of our community,” Mamabolo said, adding that the church has proven to be an organised and effective tool of mobilisation. He said as part of Transport Month, his department will use churches to communicate with vehicle drivers. “Our statistics prove that we must declare a state of emergency on our roads and we are looking at the church to curb that”, said Mamabolo. Organiser of the event, Mahlomola Kekana of Mahlomola Kekana Foundation for Community Upliftment said government should seriously consider partnering with churches like the Zion Christian Church and indigenous apostolic churches because they represent the majority of South Africans. “If government is serious about road safety it should talk to these grassroots churches,” Kekana said. Transport Month was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday in Gauteng.
