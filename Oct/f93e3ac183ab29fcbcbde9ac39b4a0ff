The Southern African Development Community (Sadec) Electoral Observer Mission to Botswana is optimistic that the country is ready to hold its general elections on Wednesday next week. Head of the Observer Mission and Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister, Dr Sibusiso Moyo, says 55 observers from eleven Sadec members states, will be deployed to various parts of Botswana. The Sadec Electoral Advisory Council says just more than 1.2 million people have registered to vote, out of a total of more than 1.5 million. “We don’t want to predict that they are going to be free and fair, but we are optimistic that Botswana has been a demonstrating member, one of the good stories of the region in as far as holding of elections. So, we don’t expect that there will be a deviation, unless there’s going to be,” says Dr Moyo.
