The South African Institute for Race Relations (SAIRR) has denied the Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane‘s allegation that it is a right-wing institution that has been interfering in the affairs of the party. Maimane made the allegation after the SAIRR called on him to step down to allow Western Cape premier Allan Winde to take over the DA leadership. The DA is expected to announce a new Federal Council chairperson after 155 delegates of a council meeting vote on Sunday. The council meeting is taking place at the DA headquarters in Johannesburg. Former DA leader Helen Zille, Athol Trollip, Thomas Walters and Mike Waters are in the race for the highly-contested position. SAIRR campaign co-ordinator Herman Pretorius has described Maimane’s allegation as unfounded. “The reaction, the haphazardness, the vehemance. Let’s put it mildly, the irrationality to that reaction to a mere opinion piece really dawn on to us that something must be done. Everything is not right in the DA, this once liberal party.
