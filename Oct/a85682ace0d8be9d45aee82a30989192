President Cyril Ramaphosa says there should be more business and trade relations between Nigeria and South Africa. Speaking at the SA-Nigeria business summit, President Ramaphosa said over 100 South African companies have made investments in Nigeria, and that South Africa is the largest purchaser of Nigerian products in Africa. He says Nigeria is a key partner for South Africa and their relationship is a strategic one. “But what are the key elements of this strategic relationship. It certainly means that there is much more than a hotline between the two Presidents. We’re able, as issues come up, to pick up the phone and talk to one another, and deal with issues. Some of those being very difficult issues such as the recent acts of violence that occurred in both countries, where a number of foreign nationals found themselves under attack. That certainly means that you need a strategic relationship to be able to deal with that,” says Ramaphosa. Watch wrap of SA-Nigeria Forum:
