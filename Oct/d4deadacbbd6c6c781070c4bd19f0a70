National Editors’ Forum, SANEF, has expressed shock at allegations of bribery levelled against Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, Gwede Mantashe. A Sunday newspaper article reports that Mantashe allegedly paid two Sunday Times journalists not to publish a story on his relationship with a student. On its official Twitter page SANEF says anyone with evidence of unethical journalism including accepting bribes, should report such matters to the Press Council for investigation. The forum has also called on political parties to support an outright ban on any form of “brown envelope” journalism.
