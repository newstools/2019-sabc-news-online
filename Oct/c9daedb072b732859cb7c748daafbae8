The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said Gauteng citizens are already tax burdened and should not be taxed further with the e-tolls. This comes after Finance Minister announced, in his Medium Term Budget policy statement on Wednesday that the Gauteng e-tolls are here to stay adding that South Africa needs to build a culture of payment. Outa’s Wayne Duvenage says, “The minister keeps singing this tune that e-tolls is an efficient user-pays scheme. Our simple response is that if it is efficient, they would be at 90% compliant. It is down to 20% compliance now. It is very inefficient, it is not a fair scheme because Gauteng citizens are paying their fuel levy, their taxes and they should not be burdened with another tax on top of that. Sanity has to prevail at some stage added Duvenage. Watch video below:
