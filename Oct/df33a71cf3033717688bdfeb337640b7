The Democratic Alliance (DA) is expected to have a new Federal Council chairperson by Sunday. The party will hold its high-contest election at the weekend. Former DA leader, Helen Zille, federal chairperson, Athol Trollip, the council’s deputy chairperson Thomas Walters and deputy chief whip Mike Waters are contesting the position. The party has also accepted the resignation of its CEO, Paul Boughey. Boughey, who held the position for five years, resigned following a recommendation by an internal review panel report, that he and party leader, Mmusi Maimane step aside. The recommendation was made after the party’s poor showing in this year’s national and provincial elections. Boughey’s resignation comes days ahead of the party’s all important election for a new federal council chair. Political analyst Sanusha Naidu says the position will be highly-contested because of its significance. “That office oversees the entire DA both in terms of branches and its structure. The candidates seem to suggest and believe that they are the best, but I think what’s also important here is to note the fact that you have Helen Zille who was a previous leader of the party who has come back and says she’s going to take the party back to liberalism. It’s gonna be a very hotly-contested battle.” Meanwhile, Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says the DA is facing a threat of splitting along racial lines. “Democratic Alliance is not about to disappear. It will still be a factor in our politics. The key issue of the Democratic Alliance is whether it stays intact and resolves its problems, therefore remains the main opposition party, or whether it declines further to a point where it may lose its position as the main opposition party.”  Click below to watch related content:
