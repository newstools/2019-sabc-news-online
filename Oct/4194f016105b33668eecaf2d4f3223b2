The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo has condemned the chaotic incident that happened during the ANC Youth League Task Team’s meeting in Lephalale on Sunday. ANC National Executive Committee members Fikile Mbalula and Malusi Gigaba fled the venue of the meeting when two vehicles belonging to league members from the Mogalakwena sub-region were burnt following the incident.  The aim of the meeting was to assess the state of the league ahead of its national elective conference next year. ANC spokesperson Donald Selamolela says they will investigate the incident. “We want to condemn in the strongest possible way the developments around that particular case that took place on Sunday; we’ll stop at nothing to investigate and take harsh actions against those involved in that particular matter. We’ll investigate that particular matter, get to understand what actually happened be able to know what’s the next course of action.”
