The High Court in Pretoria is on Thursday morning expected to hear the matter between the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and the former chairperson of the South African Airways (SAA) board Dudu Myeni. On Tuesday, Myeni said through her legal counsel, that she could not afford legal representation and wanted the court to postpone the case until she had secured funding. The court gave Myeni until the end Wednesday to seek the postponement. In March 2017, OUTA brought a case against Myeni to have her declared a delinquent director for her fiduciary conduct. Earlier this week, Myeni, a close friend of former president Jacob Zuma, claimed that she could not afford transportation costs to get to Pretoria. Advocate Daniel Mantsha who has since withdrawn as Myeni’s lawyer said that she had actively been trying to secure funds to cover her legal costs, but had been unsuccessful. OUTA’s legal representative Advocate Carol Steinberg has asked that Myeni explain why she claims that she is unemployed when she is in-fact an active director for 13 companies.  She says that Myeni’s claim that she has not received a response from the SAA director’s liability insurance to cover her legal costs is a misrepresentation to the court.  She says that Myeni only lodged a claim for cover last week, despite having known about the case since March 2017.
