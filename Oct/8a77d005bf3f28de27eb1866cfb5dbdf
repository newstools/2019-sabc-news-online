Southern African Development Community (SADC) member countries will this week join the international campaign that is calling for the removal of sanctions against Zimbabwe. This is in line with the African Union resolution to support Zimbabwe as the country struggles to rebuild its economy. Among countries that have already shown for support for the lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe are Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa and Zambia. Many believe this call will not yield positive results while others says it will put pressure on the Western countries to review their position on Zimbabwe. Marches in solidarity with Zimbabwe are planned to take place on Friday in the different SADC countries. The main march is expected to be in Harare where the ruling party â€“ ZANU-PF is mobilising support for the action. Watch related video below:
