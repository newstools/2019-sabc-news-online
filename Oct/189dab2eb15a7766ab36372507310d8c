The United Nations says it is in the process of verifying an announcement by Chile’s President that it would not longer host the annual UN Framework on Climate Change Conference known as Cop25 set for early December. Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera made the announcement after 12 days of massive protests that have seen millions take to the streets over economic inequalities in the country. SABC News has learnt that contacts are underway between UN officials and the Chilean Government after President Pinero’s announcement cancelling their hosting of both the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in November, which had expected attendees to include United States President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Cop25. The annual climate change gathering which Durban hosted back in 2011 was due to bring world leaders and climate activists together amidst alarming climate emergencies around the globe. It is unclear what contingency plans exist when a host country pulls out of such major conferences just weeks before they are due to be held. The UNFCCC, which is headquartered in Bonn, Germany, has yet to weigh in on the announcement.
