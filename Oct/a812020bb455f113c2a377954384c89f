The legal representative of former chairperson of the SAA board, Dudu Myeni, advocate Nqabayethu Buthelezi has requested the postponement of the trial in the case that the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) has brought against his client. Buthelezi has asked the court to postpone the case until the second quarter of next year. He says, as Myeniâ€™s new legal representative, he will need time to prepare for the trial. In March 2017, OUTA brought a case against Myeni to have her declared a delinquent director for her fiduciary conduct. Earlier this week, Myeni failed to show up in court on two occasions saying that she could not afford to pay for legal representation and transportation to get to Pretoria. Buthelezi made representations on behalf of Myeni in the High Court in Pretoria. Click related video below:
