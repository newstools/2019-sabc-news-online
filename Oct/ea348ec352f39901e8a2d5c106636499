Former Crime Intelligence official, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that the secret service account was used to purchase a luxury vehicle for former Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa. Naidoo, who is in witness protection, has been testifying at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg through an audio link from a secret location about the looting of millions, meant for intelligence work, during former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli’s tenure. Naidoo says Mthethwa then returned the vehicle because he was being followed by the media. “A Mercedes Benz ML350; this vehicle was purchased at Mercedes Benz Mhlanga Rocks.” Asked when the car was bought, Naidoo said it was between 2009 and 2010. “This vehicle was specifically purchased for the use by then Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa, Chair. The minister utilised the vehicle for a few months. I remember this because General Mdluli instructed me to pick up the vehicle from the minister’s house as the minister informed him that he no longer wants to use the vehicle because the journalists were following him.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
