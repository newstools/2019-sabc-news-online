The newly-formed Trade Union for Musicians of South Africa (TUMSA) is expected to enter into an incubation agreement with clothing worker’s union SACTWU at a meeting in Cape Town on Saturday morning. The agreement will establish TUMSA as a fully fledged trade union for South African musicians. TUMSA National Secretary Gabs Le Roux says the trade union for musicians will be the first of its kind in the country. “There have been associations, there are creative groupings, but nothing that looks like a proper trade union, like you find in other careers, as we stand now musicians receive no recognition as workers, we are workers, the only difference is that we don’t work for employers, as such because we are not unified  under one banner , musicians are hugely exploited.”
