Scores of residents from Tyeni village near Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape have picketed outside a local magistrate’s court where a 71 year-old man made a brief appearance for the alleged rape of his 28 year-old niece. The suspect is believed to be a preacher. The Tyeni residents packed the Ngcobo Magistrate’s court while many others picketed outside. They were calling for the suspect to be denied bail and that the justice system makes sure that he rots in jail. It’s alleged that the suspect took the woman under his care when she lost her parents a few years ago. He was arrested last week after the victim broke the silence about her uncle who has been raping her since September this year. The suspect remains in custody and will appear again on Monday the 28th for a formal bail application.
