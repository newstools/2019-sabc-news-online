Political parties have expressed concern over load shedding.  The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and the Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) say insufficient warning was given to South Africans before the load shedding was implemented, giving the public no time to prepare.  The FF Plus says the government needs to take control of the power utility and ensure that it operates adequately. The ACDP’s Steve Swart says the power-cuts are concerning as they will impact the economy in the weeks leading up to rating agency Moody’s announcement on the country’s investment status early in November. Meanwhile, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to instruct the Energy Ministry to withdraw their opposition to a court case, which will allow municipalities to procure power from independent power producers. Winde says alternative energy is the only way to ensure stable power in the future. “This will create resilience in our energy systems. (It) will definitely make sure that Eskom becomes more competitive. We keep on bailing out Eskom and Eskom itself is not able to produce the power we need and also the power we need for future jobs and the economy.”
