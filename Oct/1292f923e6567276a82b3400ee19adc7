The SABC board and executive will on Tuesday appear before Parliament’s Communications Committee to brief it about the public broadcaster’s annual report and statements for the 2018/2019 financial year. The public broadcaster is one of the entities of the Communications and Digital Technologies Department that will brief the committee. SABC’s appearance before the committee comes just over a week after the cash strapped public broadcaster received R2,1 billion of the R3,2 billion bailout from government, to keep it afloat. The balance will be received after the corporation has met the remaining conditions for the bailout. In a statement the committee says it has acknowledged the cooperation between SABC, Treasury and the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies. The committee also says it remains confident that the SABC will meet all the conditions of the bailout. Other entities which will also present their annual financial statements include, the Films and Publications Board, signal distributor SENTECH, the South African Post Office and ZA Domain Authority, .ZADNA (dot ZADNA).
