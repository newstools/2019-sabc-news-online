Mozambican voters started queuing as early as 05:00 this morning at most polling stations in the city of Beira about 1200 kilometres from Maputo. More than 1 million people have been registered to vote in 13 districts with over 20 000 voting stations. The Mozambican national electoral commission has confirmed that all voter materials have been delivered and they are ready. The country is going to polls just a few months after cyclone Idai and Kenneth wreaked havoc in the province of Sofala and other neighbouring provinces. Millions were left destitute as their houses and other infrastructure including schools, roads and businesses were damaged. Some of the voting stations are schools in the city of Beira, that have not been fully repaired. Three presidential candidates are running against current President and Frelimo leader, Filipe Nyusi. This will be the first elections without historic Renamo opposition leader, Afonso Dhlakama, who died in May last year. He ran unsuccessfully in the previous presidential elections, without accepting defeat in any of them. Mozambique has seen some violent election campaigns, raising fears that Tuesday’s presidential, parliamentary and provincial polls may not be free and fair.
