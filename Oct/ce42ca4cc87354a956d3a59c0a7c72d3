The Civil Society Working Group on State Capture on Saturday gathered at Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg to highlight the deep and wide effects of State Capture. The organization – a coalition of over 20 civil society groups – says prominent personalities who appeared before the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, have dominated headlines and ordinary people are losing sight of the ripple effect that State Capture has caused across many institutions. The Women’s Jail in Johannesburg was packed to capacity with members of the public who gathered under the theme, “The people’s hearing on State Capture: Dear Judge Zondo”. Ordinary South Africans have described how State Capture has affected their lives. Citizens say the economic implications of State Capture have severely impacted their daily lives. The aim, to make the effects of State Capture visible for ordinary South African citizens. Contributions include the effect State Capture has had on the economy and the effects that it has had on ordinary South Africans. Earlier this week, businessman and son of former President Jacob Zuma, Duduzane, appeared before the Commission giving more damning testimonies. The Civil Society Working Group says it is important to focus on the impact of State Capture on ordinary lives who carry the burden of these crimes.
