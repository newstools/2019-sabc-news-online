The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has called on South Africans to be wary of health issues caused by climate change. Their research has revealed that Southern Africa continues to record the highest increase in temperatures on the global scale. Health scientist, Juanette John says a lot still needs to be done to raise awareness on the impact of climate change on human health. “There is a lot of work to be done there in terms of both sun and heat exposure and to make sure that they have things in place to minimise the exposure. It’s important to understand what are the things that cause some hazards like,  some temperature, like things we need to be concerned about so you can actually stop before the health impact occurs.”
