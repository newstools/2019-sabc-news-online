The North West Health Department has started to roll out the mass immunisation of children around Rustenburg, following three cases of measles in three different locations in the area. Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, the three children have been admitted to hospital in isolation wards. The immunisation campaign at local clinics, creches and primary schools is targeting children aged between six-months and 59-months as well as five years and 15-years in and around the Luka, Kroondal and Boitekong areas. Parents have come out in numbers to have their children immunised. A parent says: “I brought my son to be vaccinated because I heard that measles is a very dangerous infection so I brought him to be vaccinated so that his health can be ok.” Gabaiphiwe Ramadiro of a local creche, has urged parents to have their children immunized. She says; “This disease is a very dangerous disease. It can paralyze and even kill a child. So, we urge parents to work with creches and avail their children’s clinic cards when requested to do so.” According to the World Health Organisation, measles caused an estimated 109 000 deaths in 2017. Provincial Health spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane has cautioned parents about the dangers of not having their children immunised. He says: “Measles is a viral infection and it can be fatal if not attended to. We urge our communities around that area to speed up the campaigns but to the parents we urge them to come to our facilities to immunize the children.”
