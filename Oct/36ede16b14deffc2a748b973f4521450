State Capture Commission Chair, Justice Raymond Zondo, reserved his decision on the application by former South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane to cross examine Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan. This is a second attempt by Moyane to cross examine Gordhan regarding the Minister’s affidavit to the commission, implicating Moyane in furthering the agenda of state capture. Moyane, through his lawyer  Dali Mpofu, argues that it is in the interest of the commission to know whether Moyane is indeed furthering state capture. “Does Mr Gordhan implicate Mr Moyane in state capture, obviously yes and if those three yeses are existent then leave to cross examine must be granted. We insist on our right to fairness, somebody cannot come here and say Mr Moyane is a state capturer and then that person is immunised from being questioned. The root of this problem is this notion that there are angels and devils and that there are people that are state capturers and others are not, there must never be a message that Mr Gordhan is above the law.” Click below for more on the story:
