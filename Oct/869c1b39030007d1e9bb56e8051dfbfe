The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has warned that it will continue to see an increase in caseloads in the next few years as the labour market sheds jobs. It has reported more than 193 700 cases that have been referred to it in the 2018/2019 financial year. This is compared to the 186 000 cases in the previous financial year. CCMA Director Cameron Morajane says labour dispute referrals have increased as a result of technological advancements and new labour legislation such as the National Minimum Wage. “So I can confirm to you the business and professional sectors remained the highest referring sectors sitting at 27 percent, and followed closely by the security sector accounting 12 percent, and then followed by the retail sector. Our projection for 2019 is that these caseloads that I have just presented, it is projected to increase by 25 percent.”
