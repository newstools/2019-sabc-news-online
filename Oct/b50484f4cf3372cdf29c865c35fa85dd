The High Court in Pretoria has reserved judgment in the parole application of Chris Hani’s murderer, Janusz Walus until further notice. Judge Jody Kolapen says he needs time to study the heads of arguments brought by both the applicant and the respondents. Walus’ lawyers have approached the court to request that he be released on parole. The legal representative of the SACP and the Hani family, Marumo Moerane has asked the court to dismiss Walus’ application with costs. Moerane argued that the applicant has not shown remorse and that the reasons advanced by the former minister of justice denying Walus release on parole, are sufficient for the court to rule against the applicant. Walus and the late Clive Derby-Lewis were sentenced to death for the assassination of the former SACP General Secretary in 1993, but the sentence was later converted to life imprisonment. Hani was gunned down outside his Dawn Park home in Boksburg.
