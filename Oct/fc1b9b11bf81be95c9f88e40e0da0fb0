Gauteng Premier David Makhura has called on motorists to abide by the rules of the road or face serious consequences. He made the call at the launch of the October Transport Month Campaign on the N3 Highway in Heidelberg. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was accompanied by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula officiated at the launch. Makhura says that Operation Okae Molao which started in the province on 31 July to crackdown on crime will focus on general lawlessness on the roads. “We have launched this campaign, Okae Molao, which deals with law enforcement in all respects. This month – transport month – we are going to deal with traffic offences and we will be there when we enforce Aarto (Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences). We will be there to make sure that our roads are safer. We will be there when we track down those who are committing traffic offences and to ensure that ours is a law-abiding society.” Watch video below for more on the story:
