The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it’s considering contesting the position of Johannesburg mayor. Party leader, Julius Malema, made the announcement at a media briefing in Johannesburg following the site visit of Nasrec, south of the City where the party’s second elective conference will take place in December. The post became vacant after the DA’s Herman Mashaba announced his resignation following the election of Helen Zille as the party’s Federal Executive Council Chairperson. Malema says if other parties can field their own candidates, why can’t they? “I wanted to propose that the EFF must contest and it must contest without talking to anyone, we must contest, if ANC is contesting, the DA is contesting, why is the EFF not contesting? And I’m not saying it’s the EFF position but I’m saying why is the EFF, everybody is fielding his or her candidate, you’re always looking at other people’s candidates, why cant you field your own candidate? And even ANC people and DA people who are somehow talking to the EFF informally are being disrespectful because they speak about their candidates.”
