Net 1, a subsidiary of Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) has declined to comment on the ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal in the South African Social Services Agency (SASSA) multimillion rand payment debacle. The organisation says it needs time to study the judgment before responding and determining course of action. The SCA has upheld a High Court ruling which ordered CPS to pay back more than R 316 million, with interest to the state. It found CPS opportunistic in accepting the substantial payment from SASSA in 2014. CPS took the matter to the SCA after Corruption Watch successfully challenged the legality of SASSA’s payment in the Pretoria High Court in 2018. Lawyer for Corruption Watch, Caroline James says, “We believe it vindicates the work that we have done to ensure that the payment of R316-million from SASSA to CPS is checked and there is accountability to ensure that such a payment that has been made unlawfully is not allowed to stand. At the moment, we haven’t heard any indication from CPS but we would hope that this is the end of the rather sorded chapter in South African history. We will have to wait and see whether there is an appeal launched by the CPS.” Meanwhile, SASSA welcomed the ruling on its multi-million rand payment dispute with CPS. Watch video below:
