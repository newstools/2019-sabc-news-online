The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has slammed the Eskom leadership for last week’s load shedding, describing it as economic sabotage. Numsa says the Eskom board and executive management deliberately mismanaged the power utility to justify their plans to privatise it. Although Eskom says no load shedding is expected on Wednesday, it says the electricity system remains constrained and vulnerable and any unexpected shift such as unplanned breakdowns could result in load shedding at short notice. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi says they also reject the narrative that Independent Power Producers have any future role to play in the country’s energy mix. “As things stand, they’re unable to assist us during load shedding, and to make matters worse, they’re very costly to Eskom. We are once again repeating our demand for the entire Eskom board, including and especially Jabu Mabuza, to be removed because he does not know, and they do not know what they’re doing, and they’re deliberately destroying Eskom as a result.” Click below for more on the story:
