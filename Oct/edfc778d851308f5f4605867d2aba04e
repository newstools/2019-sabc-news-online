The commission of inquiry into State Capture continues on Thursday in Parktown Johannesburg with the testimony of former MEC for Finance in the Free State Province, Elizabeth Rockman. On Wednesday Rockman told the commission that Free State Treasury would not have been aware of the operational issues at the Vrede Dairy Project in 2013. She said that in 2013 when she participated in a site visit Estina Dairy Farm it looked like a project being well run. Rockman says it would not have been easy for her department to know whether or not the R104 million that was earmarked for Estina each year was used for the intended purpose. She is adamant that monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility of the Free State Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
