A number of organisations, schools and businesses are taking part in the Gugulethu shutdown on Thursday morning to highlight Gender-Based Violence. Marchers will move from various venues to the Gugulethu mall and will embark from there to the local police station to hand over a memorandum of grievances. Sikhangele Mabhulu of Sonke Gender Justice said they want people to make a mind shift about Gender-Based Violence.
