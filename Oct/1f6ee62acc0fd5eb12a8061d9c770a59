The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) is expected to meet the Rand West City Local Municipality management this week to deal with workers’ grievances. Workers are expected to report for work today after reaching an agreement with the municipality on Monday over salary issues. The municipality had issued a notice to dismiss over 700 workers on Monday after they had embarked on a five week-long strike but withdrew it following a meeting with the workers’ unions. Samwu General-Secretary, Koena Ramotlou, says workers need to be paid fairly and correctly. “The meeting is supposed to look at how we’re going to look at the benchmarking of Rand West and other municipalities of the same size so that we can correct the payscales of workers in that municipality coming after the determination by the minister to categorise the municipality from 5 to 6. It means salaries of councillors went higher. Therefore we would have to go and benchmark with other different municipalities of the same size as Rand West City,” says Ramotlou.
