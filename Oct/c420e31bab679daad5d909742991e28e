The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs will on Wednesday meet the troubled Mogalakwena and Thabazimbi municipalities. The municipalities have experienced maladministration and political instability. Two councillors at Mogalakwena have been killed in what is related to be infighting amongst the African National Congress (ANC). Thabazimbi, which is governed by a coalition between the Democratic Alliance (DA), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Thabazimbi Residents Association, is also experiencing financial instability. The coalition administration argues that it inherited a bankrupt institution from the ANC administration following the 2016 local government elections.
