Comair , the operator of Kulula.com and British Airways says a third of its services have been affected after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) directed Comair, South African Airways and Mango, to conduct a verification exercise on their planes. This is to ensure that some of the identified irregularities are not prevalent in the entire fleet. This has caused flight delays at a number of airports.  The CAA ordered the verification exercise after it discovered irregularities at SAA Technical which provides maintenance and technical services for the airlines. “For today (Tuesday) and tomorrow (Wednesday) we’ll be continuously updating our contingency plans and communicating with our customers via sms. However, to avoid unnecessary frustration, please check your revised departure time on Kulula.com, Ba.com or comair.co.za. Our staff is working hard to ensure minimum disruption to our customers. We’re actively working with SAA Technical, and the CAA to find a speedy solution. We thank all our customers for their understanding and patience,” says Comair’s Deen Gielink. #kululaNotice Operational Update. 22 October 2019, 14.20pm pic.twitter.com/qTsYDNwWyc — kulula (@kulula) October 22, 2019
