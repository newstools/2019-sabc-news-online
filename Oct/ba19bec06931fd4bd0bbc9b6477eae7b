The two Russian “Black Jack” long-range bomber jets with nuclear capabilities again did not land at the Waterkloof Airforce Base in Pretoria on Wednesday morning.  Bad weather in Russia has prevented the jets from taking off. They were supposed to land on Tuesday afternoon but didn’t arrive due to alleged technical problems. The jets form part of several Russian Aircraft that are already in the country to improve “military to military” relations between the countries. A seminar between the two air forces about combat, search and rescue matters will be held as well. Director for corporate communication and foreign relations in the Airforce, Brigadier-General Hilton Smit, says: “Unfortunately their aircraft could not take off as indicated last night (Tuesday) and then at that moment they indicated they will take off at 3 this morning (Wednesday), unfortunately they cannot establish communication with their aircraft to determine if they have taken off, they also have a comms vehicle outside here but they can only contact them when they are a certain distance and can’t contact them now. I spoke to the DA again and they will within an hour tell us if they have taken off.”
