University of Johannesburg staff affiliated to labour union National Union of Metalworkers of South African (NUMSA), are continuing with their strike at all the institution’s campuses. Among the striking employees are security personnel, support staff and cleaners. The workers downed tools last Friday, over issues relating to salaries and medical aid. The university says it expects operations to continue uninterrupted. NUMSA spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says the strike will continue until university management engages with them to address their grievances. “At the heart of the strike is that the management of UJ is behaving and exploiting workers just like labour brokers were exploiting workers. It is truly shocking to us that a university of this calibre, which claims to have ethical values, could exploit and abuse the poorest workers in a way that UJ is doing today. Our strike will continue until management sees the light and calls us in for negotiations,” says Hlubi-Majola.
