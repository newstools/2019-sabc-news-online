Metrorail says four train carriages have caught alight at Gleincairn Station in Simon’s Town in the Cape Peninisula. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. Preliminary reports indicate that there have been no injuries. Fire and Rescue Services, the police and Metrorail technical staff are on site to investigate the incident. “The incident of course impacts all inbound and outbound Simons Town trains which are now forced to terminate until further notice. Commuters are advised to make alternative transport arrangements between Fish Hoek and Simon’s Town stations. Mop-up operations will only be able to commence after the train has been moved to the depot. The cost of the damage will only be confirmed once the damaged train has been taken to the depot,” says Metrorail Spokesperson, Riana Scott.
