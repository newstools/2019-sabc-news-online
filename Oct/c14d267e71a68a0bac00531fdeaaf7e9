Two suspects accused of the killing of two children in separate incidents in Limpopo, will on Thursday appear in the Nebo Magistrate’s Court. A 35-year-old man was arrested two weeks ago in connection with the rape and killing of a six-year-old girl at Serageng outside Marble Hall. In the other matter a 28-year-old mother allegedly killed and buried her 11-year-old son at Hlalanikahle in Monsterlus. The Nebo Magistrate’s Court is expected to be a hive of activity as the two suspects, Charles Moswathupa and Nthabiseng Mokwana make their appearances. Moswathupa allegedly lured and raped six-year-old Boitumelo Matsekoleng on the first of October. She sustained serious injuries and died on Tuesday this week at the Polokwane Hospital. Mokwana was arrested last week after residents cornered her until she revealed the whereabouts of her 11-year-old son Katlego, who had disappeared. It is alleged that she fed him porridge that had been laced with pieces of broken glass and buried him in a shallow grave at their home.
