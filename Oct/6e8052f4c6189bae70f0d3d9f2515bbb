Thousands of mine workers facing the chop at Sibanye Platinum Mine, formally known as Lonmin in Marikana, say they will not sit back, while the company embarks on mass retrenchments. They have marched to the company’s operations offices, demanding that all letters informing staff of the planned job cuts be withdrawn. Sibanye took over Lonmin in a R5 billion deal in June this year, closing four of its 11 shafts in Rustenburg. The workers say the failure by management to send a representative to receive their memorandum is a clear indication that the company is ready to push workers over the edge. These are some enraged workers. “The way the company is behaving it is now pushing us to go back to a strike and we do not want that,” says one of the miners. Another miner says; “We are really distraught, we have been working for this company for so long, they treat us like this,  since the takeover by Sibanye it has been a nightmare for us. “
