Gauteng will experience both rain and another heatwave this weekend. The SA Weather Service says it will rain in Johannesburg later on Friday and heat up again from Saturday until Monday afternoon. SABC meteorologist Azwi Tuwani Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Gauteng should brace themselves again for soaring temperatures from Saturday. “Tomorrow in Gauteng we are expecting very hot condition with partly cloudly skies, that won’t help much because we also have a heatwave. That will continue until Monday so on Tuesday that’s when we will get a break from the heatwave. We are expecting some form of rain today, it should have started now but we have clouds so there is another band of clouds that will come in around 3 o’clock. So around those times you can expect something and again 11 midnight in JHB we are still seeing another chance of rainfall,” says Tuwani.
