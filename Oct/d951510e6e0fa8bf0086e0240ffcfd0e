Deputy President David Mabuza is on a week-long visit to China where he will co-chair the 7th Session of the South Africa-China Bi-National Commission and key on his agenda will be to map out more ways for South African businesses to make inroads to the world’s second largest economy. Even before the South Africa-China Bi-National Commission kicks off, the Deputy President has a busy schedule in Beijing. On Tuesday, Mabuza will visit Chairman Mao Zedong Memorial Hall, as well as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. He will also get a tour of Huawei Technologies to get a glimpse of a company at the forefront of China’s global ambitions  before meeting with Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership. The trip is said to be aimed at promoting mutually beneficial relations at both continental and global stage. But South Africa has an eye on the opportunity China can offer. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in 2010 has seen the two countries build on diplomatic relations over the past decade. But on the trade front, the scales appear out of balance. Around 26 South African companies have invested a total of around R88 billion in China since 2003. By contrast, 88 Chinese firms have invested around R116 billion in South African over the same period.
