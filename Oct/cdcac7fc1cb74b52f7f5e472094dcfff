It is still not clear whether Gauteng Premier David Makhura will make this week’s deadline to reshuffle his cabinet. Makhura is expected to drop a male member of the executive council – the MEC and replace it with a female in line with the ANC NEC’s resolution that where a premier is male, 60% of the executive must be women. Makhura had a 50:50 gender parity. ANC Gauteng Spokesperson, Bonisile Modise says it was never the intention of the province to defy the NEC instruction. “We did not think that the issue should only be applying to Exco, where its MEC’s and so on and so forth. Hence there would’ve been 50/50, but moving forward, we’ll enter into that debate to say ‘when (should the) issue of 50/50 or 50% minimum apply?’ Because if you check in Gauteng, the Exco on itself it has 5 males and 5 females, excluding the Premier. And that to us, also means that we have satisfied the issue of minimum of 50%. But in this instance, we’ve learned that the specific is that the 60/40 should apply within Exco and not in terms of overall decision-making processes.”
