Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has described a break-in at Esithebeni Primary School in Soweto as devastating. Property worth over R3 million including computers and learners’ smart boards were stolen on Friday night. Lesufi who was accompanied by the police and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, visited the school. He says criminals have developed new ways of gaining access to high security schools. “We are devastated, emotionally drained. We have put huge security, there are alarms, there are burglar doors. What they’ve done these guys; they’ve devised new methods of coming with things that will break the walls. They literally broke the walls so that they can gain access and they took property worth over R3 million. It’s just devastating and heart breaking. “
