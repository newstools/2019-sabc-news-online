Chairperson of the National Council of Province’s (NCOP) Select Committee on Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, China Dodovu says that municipal officials who misuse public funds should face the might of the law. He was speaking during a meeting with officials at Makhado Municipality in Louis Trichardt in Limpopo. The municipality has an irregular and unauthorised expenditure amounting to R164 million. It has also lost R62 million in the VBS investments. Dodovu says he will propose to the NCOP that criminal cases be opened against officials who mismanage public funds. “All the municipalities are going to fail if there’re no consequences for wrongdoing. People act with impunity and I’m going to propose the following; those who cannot get their way in presenting these to councils, people must go and register this with the police because we cannot afford a situation whereby people use the monies of the state in a very irregular, unauthorised way and there’re no consequences for their actions.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
