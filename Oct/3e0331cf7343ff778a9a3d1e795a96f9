The Breytenbach Centre in Wellington in the Boland which assists with skilling the community is facing closure if enough funding is not raised within the next four months. The Centre houses ten skills training programs, which include drama, art, needlework, early child development and computer training. Centre Manager, Francois Lotter says funding is mainly for the much-needed restoration of the building. “The building was last renovated 15 years ago and it needs an upliftment again, and it’s an old building and we just need that R1,4 million for that and also the running costs because we did have money like investments in the past, you know people who gave us money, but we are in the process of finding more money just to keep the place running.” The centre was the childhood home of anti-apartheid activist and author Breyten Breynbach.
