National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise says delays in her animal cruelty court case are done purposefully with the intention of causing her to lose in court. Modise made the comments outside the Potchefstroom Regional Court, in the North West, while addressing her supporters. Her case has been postponed to March 2019. Modise is accused of leaving her North West farm unattended, causing the deaths of more than 50 pigs and other animals in 2014. Modise has accused the AfriForum of dragging out the case. “I am ready for this trial whenever it comes. I do know that the running around, the lies, the not meeting up, the whatever that is dragging it, actually it is meant to make sure that blacks never win in court. But we will persevere because they drag it out until you know that you cannot afford lawyers and you have to stand by yourself.”  Watch a related video:
