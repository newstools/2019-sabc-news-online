The fourth suspect in the kidnapping case of six-year-old Amy Leigh de Jager is expected to be back in court on Wednesday. Molemohi Bafokeng made his first appearance in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrates Court in the Vaal last week on charges of kidnapping and extortion. His co-accused Tharina Human, Laetitia Nel and Pieter van Zyl, have already made their submissions in the same court on Tuesday on why they should be given bail.  Bafokeng was arrested outside Vanderbjilpark last week. During his previous appearance, the state ordered for the 24-year-old Bafokeng, whoâ€™s believed to be a Lesotho national, to be profiled and his status in the country be verified. The four are accused of kidnapping Amy Leigh immediately after her mother dropped her off at school. Click on related videos below:
