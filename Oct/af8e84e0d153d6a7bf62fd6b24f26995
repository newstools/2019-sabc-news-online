President Cyril Ramaphosa is traveling to the UK this weekend to try and drum up foreign investment for South Africa. He’ll also deliver a keynote speech at the Financial Times’ Africa Summit, in London.  Ramaphosa will be joining leaders of industry, business, politics, and economics to discuss the future of Africa. The President will be in London for two days and is due to arrive on Sunday at London’s Heathrow airport, before enjoying dinner at Claridge’s hotel – famous for its historic links with Britain’s Royal family. The dinner includes other speakers who’ll be addressing the Financial Times Africa Summit on Monday. Organisers say this conference will have a special emphasis on youth, women, entrepreneurs, scientists, and artists. The last time the President was in London was for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April last year, but he was forced to return early to deal with protests in Mahikeng. His trip to the UK this time is to try and boost investment comes as Britain enters a crucial phase in working out the future of Brexit – and therefore future trading relations with South Africa.
