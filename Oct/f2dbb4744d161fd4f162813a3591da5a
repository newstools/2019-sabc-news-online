Many detractors thought it would perish, but six years later the all-electric Formula E series continues to flourish. The opening round of the world’s only all-electric single-seat formula takes place in Diriyah in Saudia Arabia on November 22-23. Two races will be held in Diriyah before Formula E embarks on its world tour. Twelve more races will be held on five continents until the end of July 2020. The FIA-sanctioned series could even make its way to Cape Town, learn more here.
