Justice Minister Ronald Lamola says #FeesMustFall activist Kanya Cekeshe’s application for leave to appeal his conviction means the Department cannot help him apply for a presidential pardon. Cekeshe’s legal team filed an urgent appeal against Monday’s judgment after he was denied bail and leave to appeal his conviction. Lamola faced criticism for tweeting that the Department would assist Cekeshe to apply for a presidential pardon.  Lamola told the Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio Committee that his comments were based on an earlier promise, after being approached by members of Parliament and others as to what he was going to do about fees must fall activists. He says there is no blanket amnesty for activists. Watch the video below for related news:
