The former Executive of Corporate Affairs at Eskom, Chose Choeu says the relationship between Eskom and the Gupta-owned New Age TNA breakfast events began to seem more like a commercial relationship in which TNA was benefitting,  but with no real value for Eskom. He says that is why he decided not to contract the Guptas’ TNA breakfast briefing for a second time from 2013 to 2014. Earlier, Choeu denied that he pushed for Eskom to sponsor the TNA briefings, following an instruction from former Eskom CEO Brian Dames and former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba. Choeu conceded that the New Age’s business breakfast sponsorships were contracted without getting final approval from Eskom’s sponsorship committee. Choeu is responding to questions at the commission of inquiry into allegations of State Capture currently underway in Parktown, Johannesburg.
