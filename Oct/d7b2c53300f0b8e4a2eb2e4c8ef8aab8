Gauteng police have advised members of the public to be vigilant when they visit shopping malls. This follows a robbery at Cresta Mall in Randburg north of Johannesburg on Tuesday. Police say a number of suspects robbed an electronics store. One suspect was killed and another arrested in a shootout with police at New Canada in Soweto. Police have launched a manhunt for more suspects linked to the robbery. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says: “We want to advise our consumers who go to the mall just to be careful and be vigilant. If you do not feel safe, go to security in the mall. We also have our sector policing cars that are patrolling.” Peters says that the police will be intensifying their deployment in areas identified as hotspots. Watch the video below for more:
