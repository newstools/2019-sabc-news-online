The court case of controversial pastor, Timothy Omotoso has been postponed to the 23rd of October in the Port Elizabeth High Court. This is to await the Supreme Court of Appeal ruling on an application by defence lawyer, Peter Dauberman to petition to the SCA. Dauberman previously argued that the court only had jurisdiction over seven out of the 97 charges faced by Omotoso and his two co-accused. He brought an application to have all charges heard in the jurisdictions where the alleged offences occurred, but it was dismissed by presiding judge, Irma Schoeman.
