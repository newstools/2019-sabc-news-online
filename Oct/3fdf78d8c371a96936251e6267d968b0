The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg will on Tuesday turn its attention back to The New Age (TNA) newspaper. Eskom Acting General Manager for Strategic Marketing and Branding Peter Pretorius will appear before the Commission to shed more light on the contract the power utility had with the TNA’s breakfast briefings. Eskom ended the R45-million deal with the Gupta-owned company in 2017. On Monday, former Free State Head of Agriculture Peter Thabethe amended his affidavit after admitting that he had met with a member of the Gupta family once at their Saxonwold home in 2013. On Friday last week, Thabethe submitted a supplementary affidavit to the commission with regard to the Gupta managed Estina Dairy project in Vrede. Watch Peter Thabethe’s testimony below:
