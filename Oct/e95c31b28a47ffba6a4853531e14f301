KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Sihle Zikalala has condemned the police for inviting the media when they conduct raids or make arrests at the homes of politicians. He was speaking at a meeting of ANC branches that party President Cyril Ramaphosa also addressed in eThekwini on Thursday.   Last week, police searched and raided the homes of former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, in the presence of the media. Zikalala says, “The manner in which police conduct themselves – it undermines the way government and the ANC works. As the ANC, we are fully committed in fighting crime and corruption, but for the police to mobilise TV cameras and go to homes of people is wrong.” “It was wrong even at a time it was done to comrade [Jacob] Zuma, and we even today say it is wrong to conduct themselves in such a manner – regardless who it is directed to. If police have a case against a person they must arrest but not to parade their arrests in the media,” explains Zikalala.
