The City of Cape Town and South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) have reached an interim agreement regarding a strike by firefighters about overtime pay. Firefighters will return to their normal duties until the matter is resolved in the Labour Court in Cape Town on the 29th of next month. The union represents around 80% of more than 900 firefighters in the city. Some of them have been on strike since last week. They had been working an eight-hour-shift instead of an average 72-hour shift. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security for the City of Cape Town, JP Smith says the focus must now shift to saving the lives of citizens. ” I call on firefighters and management to work together in the interest of our residents. The court has plotted the way forward, and I encourage everyone to abide by it. I also trust that all parties will abide by the final court ruling when it is made, so that we can return the focus to firefighting and saving lives without the threat of sporadic industrial action in this very essential service.”
