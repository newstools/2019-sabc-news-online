Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says alternative measures should be found to curb escalating costs at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Since it started more than a year ago, the inquiry has cost the tax payer more than R350 million. Malema says they have requested the Commission’s Chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to find cheaper options to save costs. “It has become very expensive, we like the job they’re doing, some level of truth is coming out at the commission. Some of the things we knew about them, we spoke about them before but I was saying this to the chief justice that we can find cheaper ways of arriving at the same conclusion.” Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) says it fully supports the commission. The party’s Chairperson Gwede Mantashe says those implicated must face the music. “ Let’s not be difficult with the Zondo Commission, it would not be necessary for the chief justice to talk about the commission, it is us who must talk about it and defend and say it must continue its work, finish it and give us a report. If there are consequences, we must face the consequences.” Meanwhile, Duduzane Zuma appeared before the commission on Monday.
