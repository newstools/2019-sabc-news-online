Former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader and Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, is eligible to contest for the leader of the party’s Federal Council chairperson. This is according to the party’s Presiding officer of its Federal Council for Elections, Desiree van der Walt. She was responding to some newspaper report which cast doubt on Zille’s eligibility to compete for the position. Van der Walt says she is satisfied as the presiding officer that all those nominated have been vetted and met the criteria to compete for the position. She has reminded candidates that the rules of engagement does not include negative campaigning. Zille is competing against Athol Trollip, Thomas Walter and Mike Waters. The election for the position takes place later this month. The position became vacant after incumbent James Selfe resigned in June this year.
