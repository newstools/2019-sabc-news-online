Former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, has accused Police Minister Bheki Cele of being behind Thursday’s raids, which the Hawks conducted at her houses in Inanda and Umhlanga, north of Durban. The African National Congress Congress (ANC) had placed Gumede on leave of absence earlier this year. This after she was arrested for alleged fraud and corruption in connection with a R208 million waste management tender. Gumede is out on bail and her case is due to resume in the High Court in Durban in January next year. Speaking on Gumede’s behalf, Mzomuhle Dube says the former mayor is saddened by the latest developments as they are politically-motivated. “Gumede is quite saddened by the recent developments. They are unwarranted. Unfortunately, the timing of the raid is definitely coinciding with a process that is about to unfold, where branches of the ANC will be nominating the next crop of leadership. We cannot then therefore divorce what is happening now away from politics, because we have a fact that points to the direction of the current minister of police, who once summoned umam’uGumede and asked her not to accept the eThekwini nomination,” says Dube.
