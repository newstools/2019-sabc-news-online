Police have launched a manhunt for suspects responsible for shooting and wounding a cash-in-transit security guard during a robbery in KwaMashu, north of Durban. Police spokesperson Brenda Muridili says an unknown number of suspects held up and shot at guards on Monday near the Tembalihle railway station. Police say security guards of a cash-in-transit vehicle had just collected cash at the railway station, when they were attacked by unknown gunmen. The guard carrying the cash was shot in the leg while the other guards had their guns taken from them; the wounded guard was later taken to hospital for medical attention. The suspects fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash and a case of robbery has been registered. The SAPS is appealing to anyone with information to contact the crime stop number 08600 10 111.
