Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has urged the South African government to relax its regulatory framework and make it easy for Nigerian companies to do businesses in the country. He was speaking at the opening of the 9th SA-Nigeria Bi-National Commission (BNC) underway at the Union Building in Pretoria on Thursday. Buhari is in the country on a state visit in a bid to improve the frosty relations following attacks on foreign nationals and to strengthen trade and economic ties between the two nations. He said his country is open for business and implored Pretoria to do the same.  President Cyril Ramaphosa has told Buhari that South Africa is committed to African unity and deeply regrets the recent spate of attacks on foreign nationals last month. The BNC which is presided by the two heads of state seeks to strengthen economic and political relations between the two nations. But Ramaphosa used the occasion to assure his Nigerian counterpart that the country is home for all. “We must work to significantly increase and diversify trade between our two nations and to make conditions conducive for greater investment. We must seek opportunities to extend cooperation on resource beneficiation for the benefit of our people, especially through tourism, sports, culture, educational exchanges and many other areas. Through greater economic development, cultural exchange and social cohesion,  we can advance our objective of a stable and peaceful Africa,” says Ramaphosa.  Click link for more
