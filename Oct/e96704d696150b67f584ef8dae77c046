Northern Cape Premier Dr Zamani Saul has intervened in the unstable water supply that is negatively affecting Kimberley residents. A task team has been formed to assess immediate measures and long-term solutions to address the water challenges. Earlier this week, the Sol Plaatje Municipality imposed water restrictions. Water will be switched off at night to secure adequate continuous water supply during the day. Premier Saul says the bulk infrastructure is unable to keep up with the current major development in the City. “We put up a team of engineers to look at the actual problems of bulk water supply and the ageing infrastructure so that we can come up with the comprehensive plan to address this problem, once and for all.” Saul says he has asked for a report. “Based on the report that we’re going to get, we have to go out and look for money to overhaul the entire bulk infrastructure of Sol Plaatje. f we don’t do that, these disruptions will come almost each and every year, almost each and every month.” For a related video click below:
