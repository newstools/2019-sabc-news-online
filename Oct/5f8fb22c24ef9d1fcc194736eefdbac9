The City of Johannesburg says it was able to bring one of its walk-in centres, the Thuso House, back into operation after hacking threat messages were sent to some staff â€“ forcing the suspension of a number of online services. The City says it hopes to have other online services up-and-running again by this weekend after a hackers group sent demands to individual staff at the city. Some staffers received messages that they had been hacked and demand was made for two bitcoin. The Shadow Kill Hackers had earlier claimed to the SABC News desk that they were trying to point out vulnerabilities in computer systems and would identify these in exchange for bitcoin. The City warned customers that several of its online systems, including its website, e-services and billing system had been shut down. City spokesperson, Nthatisi Modingoane says IT and forensic experts are looking into the matter. Watch related video:
