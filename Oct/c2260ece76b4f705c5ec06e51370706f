Members of Parliament will on Tuesday return to work after the Spring recess. A total of 43 committees will be sitting this week, as well as the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) where President Cyril Ramaphosa will answer oral questions on Thursday. They include border control and security, challenges facing Eskom and governmentâ€™s plans to fight gender based violence. The various portfolio committees will be dealing mainly with annual and Budget Review and Recommendations(BRR) reports of government departments and entities. The BRR reports must be finalised before Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tables the Mini Budget later this month. These reports help Parliament to evaluate service delivery commitments of government plans and budgets.
