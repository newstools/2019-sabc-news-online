Energy analyst, Chris Yelland, says Eskom’s lack of transparency has resulted in consumers being unable to prepare for load shedding. Eskom says it will continue with stage two load shedding on Thursday- from 9am to 11pm – which is expected to continue for the rest of the week. The power utility says the power outages are due to high levels of unplanned breakdowns and a shortage of capacity. Yelland explains possible short and long-term solutions to avoid load shedding in future. “Eskom’s lack of transparency is such that customers are not able to adequately prepare for this. Eskom needs to pay as much attention as it can and spend as much money as it can on maintenance, improving the availability of its existing plants.” “Customers can put generation capacity onto the grid and form a rooftop solar. This can bring several thousands of megawatts onto the grid and this can be delivered in one year. The only thing holding this back is government, Nersa and Eskom red tape all holding this back because they are trying to protect their own vested interests.”  Click video below:
