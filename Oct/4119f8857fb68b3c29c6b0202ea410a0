African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says he’s proud of the KwaZulu-Natal provincial leadership for ensuring that unity is realised within the party. He says the party’s 54th national elective conference was the epitome of the project of renewal in the ANC after years of decay. Ramaphosa was delivering the OR Tambo Memorial Lecture in Soweto. “We applaud the comrades in KwaZulu-Natal that have forged unity in reality and principled unity for that matter.” “They decided that working in different camps, in different factions will never help the people of our country any better and they decided cautiously that they’re going to unite the province, they’re going to work together, where comrades who didn’t even like each other started working together. ” Click video below:
