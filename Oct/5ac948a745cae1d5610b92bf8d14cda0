The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will be requesting a meeting with Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams and SABC management to determine how the public broadcaster met the five requirements in order to garner a partial bailout. On Friday, Ndabeni-Abrahams announced that R2.1 billion will be transferred to the SABC on Monday. This forms part of the R3.2 billion rand bailout requested by the SABC. The DA says it will further want to know details of how the SABC plans to fulfil the remaining three requirements. The party says it will also closely monitor how the funds are utilised and if any mismanagement is found it will not hesitate to take action against the public broadcaster. The conditions which were only partially or not at all met, include producing separate financial reporting for public and commercial broadcasting services, identifying non-core assets for sale as well as developing a comprehensive private sector participation strategy.
