Philanthropist and Zimbabwean businessman, Strive Masiyiwa, says he believes it is possible for governments around the world to stop corruption. Masiyiwa delivered the 9th Annual Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture in Cape Town on Monday, which coincided with Tutu’s 88th birthday celebrations. The Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture has been designed as a platform for the next generation of thinkers to identify new human solutions for current and future challenges. Masiyiwa has used his wealth to provide scholarships to more than 100 000 young Africans. “There will be a price to pay. We have got to tell the generation of young people that there is nothing worth fighting for which you are not prepared to pay the price. We shout corruption but still find it convenient to pay the policeman at the traffic light. That is not what is going to deal with corruption. We need to enforce and protect laws that help whistle-blowers,” says Masiyiwa.  Watch a related video below:
