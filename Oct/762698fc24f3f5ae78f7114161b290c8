Deputy Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu- Natal, Mike Mabuyakhulu has appealed to residents of Newcastle and the province at large to continue to take cognisance of the role played by Robert Mugabe to liberate Africa. The late former president of Zimbabwe died in September in Singapore aged 95 years. Mabuyakhulu says it is not a mistake that the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has taken a decision to honour Mugabe, but to make sure that he is given the great respect he deserves. Mabuyakhulu addressed hundreds of ANC members gathered at Majuba TVET College for the Robert Mugabe memorial lecture. “For us, it was not just a moment to mourn the passing of a giant. For us, it was a moment of reflection, to remember the contributions, the trials and tribulations that Robert Mugabe had to go through in the sacrifices to deliver our own freedom.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
