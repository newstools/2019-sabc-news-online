Police Minister Bheki Cele says criminals in the Western Cape have declared war on law enforcement officers. He was speaking while visiting police officer, Danie Botha, in hospital, after he was shot while responding to a crime scene in Muizenberg earlier this week. Minister Cele says curbing attacks on police is a main priority for his department. “I have said that there’s some extra hostility here between the criminals and the law enforcement agencies. The people that have been killed here are not just South African Police Service members only, also some Metro Police. I visited family members a few weeks ago; it looks like there’s anti law enforcement sentiment that is going around here. So ours is to jack up our guards, the only thing that I can guarantee you is that we will win the war.”
