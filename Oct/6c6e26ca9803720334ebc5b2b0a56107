The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) says 30 matric examination centres have been affected by load shedding. Ministry spokesperson, Bronagh Hammond, says power outages have had an impact on the writing of Wednesday’s Computer Applications Technology paper. She says measures have been put in place for Thursday’s Information Technology exams. Hammond says no learner is allowed to leave the examination venue when the power goes out. “Learners that had already begun the exam will continue with where they left off once the electricity comes back on. There is an automatic save function so that learners do not lose the work already completed in event of an electrical shortage or malfunctioning. The WCED is in constant communication with all the schools via their subject advisors to ensure that the exam is managed in consistent manner.”
