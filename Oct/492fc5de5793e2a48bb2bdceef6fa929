The case against three senior former South African Revenue Services (SARS) officials accused of their involvement in the so-called SARS rogue unit has been postponed in the High Court in Pretoria. Ivan Pillay, Andries Janse van Rensburg and Johann van Loggerenberg will appear again in court on 17 February next year. The matter was postponed to give the NPA an opportunity to study more than four thousand pages of representations the men made. They are accused of illegally bugging the offices of the former Scorpions and the NPA in 2007. Their lawyer, Bernard Hotz explains: “Very lengthy representations were made, a complete story has been told with evidence which caught to cause the NPA sufficient reason to take enough time to consider seriously the representations that have been made. I can tell you the representations exceed 4000 pages with annexure. So in order for people to properly consider one has to give them sufficient time to do so,” says Hotz. It’s alleged they unlawfully bugged the National Prosecuting Authority’s offices in 2007. Lawyers for the accused want the NPA to consider representations of a review panel to have all charges against them dropped. They believe there are no prospects of a successful prosecution.
