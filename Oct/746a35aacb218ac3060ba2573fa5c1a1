Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu will on Sunday visit the Johannesburg CBD to assess progress made on the Urban Renewal Project. The national government has committed over R1 billion this financial year towards the development of inner cities across the country. This investment is aimed at providing decent and affordable accommodation for low income earners and students. This should be done either through the conversion of old and dilapidated buildings or construction of new buildings. Sisulu will visit several government-funded buildings that have provided decent accommodation to a number of households. Watch a related video below:
