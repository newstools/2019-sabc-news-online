The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in Parliament says if Eskom Acting CEO and board Chairperson, Jabu Mabuza is not winning the battle to resolve the crisis at the power utility – he should step down. IFP Member of Parliament and Spokesperson on Energy Chief Mzamo Buthelezi says the power utility needs capable people who are willing to take difficult decisions to turn Eskom around. The IFP is among many political parties to add its voice to those who are condemning the implementation of load shedding in the last few days. “You know, if you are serious about solving the issue of Eskom, you need to make sure that you put people at the helm who’ve got experience; who’ve got qualities; and who’ve got a sense of duty and willing as to actually turn things around. Not people who sit there and listen to their bosses elsewhere and fail to deliver on the core mandate of that entity. If Eskom continues to go down while he (Mabuza) is there as the Acting CEO and Chairperson, it shows that he is not actually winning the battle. So, if he is not winning the battle he must come aside and then someone else should come in – a person that will not be fearing to take hard decisions,” says Buthelezi.
