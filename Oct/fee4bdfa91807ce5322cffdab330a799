More than R14 million worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated by police at the China Multiplex storage facilities in the Johannesburg CBD. Police earlier confiscated sanitary towels and counterfeit running shoes worth R12 million in Sandringham. Police spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters says:”With these consecutive multimillion rand confiscations police believe the purposeful shift from focusing on illegal traders to focusing on the manufacturing and distribution points is yielding success.” “At this point operations have led to shutting down of a number of manufactures and points of supply especially in the Johannesburg CBD. ”
