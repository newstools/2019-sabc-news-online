Again we wish all candidates the very best of luck.” Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has wished matric learners well.

More that 41000 of them are part time candidates, ANC spokesperson in Gauteng Bones Modise says, “We claimed number one spot with 87.9% in 2018 and the historic eight of top 10 performing districts coming from Gauteng. We therefore make a call on all parents and communities not to put learners under unnecessary pressure, and to make sure that they use the departmental helpline which is 0800 055 555 or 011 645 2000 for further assistance as they prepare for the exams.”
