The case against the man accused of killing his girlfriend and burying her body in a shallow grave inside a shack in Vlakfontein south of Johannesburg is expected to resume on Wednesday. Thokozani Sibeko is facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice after police found the body of his 41-year-old girlfriend, identified as Mathapelo Mbele, buried under his bed. He had allegedly lived with the dead woman’s body buried under his bed for close to two months. Mbele’s body was discovered by the police on the 4th of August after she had been reported missing by her family. Sibeko is expected to appear in court via CCTV from the Johannesburg Correctional Centre. He abandoned his bail application during his last appearance at the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto.
