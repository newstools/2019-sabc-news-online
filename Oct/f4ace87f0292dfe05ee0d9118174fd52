Communication and Digital Technologies Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams  says drone technology is at the heart of the 4th industrial revolution. She was delivering the keynote address at DRONE-CON 2019 in Durban – the largest annual drone industry event on the continent. Various leaders and stakeholders were in attendance. KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development and Tourism MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube says it’s important for a city like Durban to ensure the use of drones. “KZN province is a coastal province. We have a wide variety of the coastal shores that need guarding at all times. We have the Transnet ports. The port security needs, at all times, highly sophisticated technology to be up to speed so that it will ensure the security of our shores and ports.”
