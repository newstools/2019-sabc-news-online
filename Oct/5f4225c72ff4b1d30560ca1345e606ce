Eighteen people arrested for various charges including kidnapping, house robbery, murder and pubic violence in Bloemhof in the North West, are expected to appear in the local magistrate’s court on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwaabone says, “The suspects were arrested at various locations of Bloemhof for cases ranging from kidnapping, house robbery, murder to public violence. The suspects were arrested on Monday and among those arrested are members of an anti-gangersterism committee, a local structure which has been fighting gangsters and criminals in the area. Mokgwaabone says, “The other suspects are expected to face a charge relating to public violence that erupted in March on the Boitumelong sports ground where the North West premier was expected to addresses the community about their concerns.” Some residents in Boitumelong township have condemned the arrests of their members by the police. Their arrests have led to violent protests on the N12 freeway linking Johannesburg and Cape Town. Protesters have barricaded the highway and several shops belonging to foreigners have been looted. Some community members say those arrested are innocent and have assisted in the decline of criminal activities in their area.
