The M2 highway in Johannesburg is due to re-open on Monday. The City will hold a ribbon cutting ceremony on Thursday where they will announce the operational plan to be rolled out over the weekend which includes clean-up operations. Work to the motorway started in February causing major peak-hour congestion on the M1 North and South. The head of Johannesburg’s Department for Infrastructure Development is Siya Genu says R158 million was budgeted for the work. He says: “For the bridge structures we spent about R155 million. We then resurfaced the entire section of the M2 between the bridge structures, which is about 4kms. That has cost us R34 million.” “At least when it is open to traffic it will look fairly new. So all the work has been completed as of Thursday but we need to clean up the M2 because it has been a construction site.”
