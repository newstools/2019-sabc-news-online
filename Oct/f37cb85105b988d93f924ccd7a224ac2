The Gift of the Givers Foundation says it has been able to find a good water supply through a number of boreholes in drought-stricken Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape. The organisation will also deliver a large volume of animal fodder for struggling commercial and emerging farmers in the region. The organisation’s leader, Imtiaz Sooliman, says there is also a need for supplementary nutrition for school learners which will be distributed and more bottled water will also be delivered . “Our hydrolist Dr Groendewald has sighted seven boreholes and we struck seven out of seven. We have been very lucky the first 5 are collectively producing 102 thousand litres of water per day in an area where finding water is difficult, the 6th we haven’t tested the amount yet. They were still drilling the 7th yesterday. Hopefully by Tuesday  we move in with truck loads of fodder – because this has been a huge demand by farmers, commercial and emerging farmers.”
