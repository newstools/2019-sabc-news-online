The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) newly-elected Federal Council (Fedco) Chairperson, Helen Zille says she wants to discuss Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba’s concerns. Zille was responding to questions about Mashaba’s intention to resign if she won the election. Speculation is rife that Mashaba is going to announce his resignation on Monday, following his announcement in the days leading to the DA’s elections that he would resign should the right-wing aligned DA faction win.   Last week, Mashaba confirmed to SABC News that he would leave the party if it was taken over by what he called right-wing elements and expressed concerns over the direction his party was taking. Zille says she would need to have a meeting with Mashaba over the issue. “I wouldn’t jump into conclusion about Herman Mashaba by what I read in the newspapers and I would love to have a chat with Herman Mashaba. In fact, if I recall correctly I was one of the people who recruited him into the Democratic Alliance. I did my very best and will continue doing my best to recruit people into the DA.” Meanwhile DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, has applauded Zille for being elected as FedCo chairperson. The party elected Zille during its council meeting this weekend. She takes over from James Selfe who has served in the position for 19 years. Maimane says he believes Zille’s leadership will help strengthen the party. “I also want to congratulate Helen Zille and I want to wish her well on her election of Chairperson of Federal Council. Certainly, I think that it will be good. She brings in a new energy. She’ll be full-time in the role. She’ll bring vigour and ultimately, she’ll work with the leadership of the organisation. The leader of the organisation provides the direction of the organisation. I want to call upon all members of the DA, ultimately, we have to focus on the future and focus on the future of South Africa.”
