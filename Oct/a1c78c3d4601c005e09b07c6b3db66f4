The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) at the SABC say a climate of fear is persisting at the public broadcaster, especially since the announcement of the partial bailout from government. Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams announced that the SABC would on Monday receive a R2.1 billion portion of the R3.2 billion bailout it requested from government. Bemawu President Hannes du Buisson says many fear that this will be used to effect mass retrenchments. “The general concern and the feeling from staff are that the SABC management at this point in time thinks that they are worthless that they are useless and that they must and will be replaced by people externally.” “We know that for instance certain positions were advertised internally and there was a unilateral being made by management that they are not going to appoint the best candidate , they are going to go externally and then appoint people from outside and we believe that that is an increase in head count.” Watch related video…
