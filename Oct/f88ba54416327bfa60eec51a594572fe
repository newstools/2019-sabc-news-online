Deputy Police Minister, Cassel Mathale, says the process of appointing a permanent head for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), is at a short listing stage. Mathale was part of a delegation of IPID management to brief Parliament’s Police Portfolio Committee on their annual report for the 2018/19 financial year. The directorate has been without a permanent head since the term of Robert McBride came to an end six months ago. MPs expect Mathale to give them a detailed report on the appointment process before the end of this month. “The post was advertised and it has closed. We need to do shortlisting and interviews but we will further update you on the 23rd when we give further update on IPID report,” says Mathale. Watch related video below:
