President Cyril Ramaphosa has wished the Mozambican people a successful election. Thousands of Mozambicans went to the polls on Tuesday to choose the country’s next presidential, parliamentary and provincial leaders. The main contenders of Mozambique’s presidential election come from the country’s two rival parties, Frelimo and Renamo,  whose leaders are the incumbent Filipe Nyusi and Ossufo Momade respectively. President Ramaphosa was speaking in Pretoria where he accepted letters of credence from newly-arrived representatives of the diplomatic corps. “As South Africans we wish the people of Mozambique the best as they hold a peaceful election to choose the government of their country and this to us deepens democracy and it strengthens it. We look forward to continuing our wonderful relations with Mozambique and the people of Mozambique.”
