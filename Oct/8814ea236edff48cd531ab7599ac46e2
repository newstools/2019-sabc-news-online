Weak management, unequal access to healthcare and staff shortages remain the biggest hurdle facing some hospitals in the Northern Cape. The observation  was made by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC ) which embarked on a four-day tour to various hospitals across the province. Internal operations in some hospitals in the province left the Commission concerned. Most of the hospitals are run by managers who are in an acting capacity and not full time. “Management is not that strong because there are too many acting positions. They should move towards permanent positions because then you have a hospital that is much more stable and working and producing,” says SAHRC Chairperson, Advocate Bongani Majola. The commission has also observed the inequality that exists between patients in the rural and urban areas. Concluding that those in the rural parts of the province are disadvantaged. “People who are in the rural areas are not getting equal access to health care as the people that are in urban areas. It impacts negatively on people in far of rural areas to come all the way to Kimberley not to be attended,” adds Advocate Majola. Premier of the Northern Cape, Dr Zamani Saul noted the commission’s concerns. “We highly appreciate the work which they have done and we firmly believe that it will assist us to improve the quality of healthcare services that we render for the people of the Northern Cape,” says  Saul. The commission believes prioritising quality healthcare in rural areas will in turn lessen the overcrowding at district and provincial hospitals.
