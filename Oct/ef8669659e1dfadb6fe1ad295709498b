Glencore Alloys South Africa has officially handed over Ehlanzeni TVET College Campus to the community of Mashishing, formerly known as Lydenburg, in Mpumalanga. The TVET College will provide mining-related studies amongst others.  Now young people in Mashishing and surrounding areas under the Thaba Chweu local municipality, who intend to study engineering, will no longer be compelled to go to far-flung areas to pursue their studies. Glencore South Africa converted offices donated by Public Works to a fully-fledged TVET Campus. The campus has an administration block, laboratory, workshop and a computer centre. The institution will cater for about 600 students. Glencore CEO, Japie Fullard, says they have spent about R7 million to refurbish the building. Fullard says their main aim is to see young people getting better education opportunities. “It is very important for us that we understand that the youth that’s our future. So the more we invest in the youth the better for the country. The partnership came through Public Works where they gave the infrastructure and we then invested the seven million to change from Public Works into classrooms and those types of things.”
