The South African Post Office‘s (SAPO ) wage bill is ridiculously high. That’s according to SAPO Acting CEO, Lindiwe Kwele. The wage bill is close to reaching 70% of the Post Office’s budget. Kwele and various officials appeared before Parliament’s Communications Committee to brief it about the Post Office’s 2018/2019 financial statements. She says the huge wage bill is hampering to SAPO’s ability to carry out its functions. “Chairperson, one of the critical impediments of our sustainability – our wage bill is ridiculously high. We are sitting at almost 69%, which is not sustainable. And the issue of staff optimisation is something that we’ve been aggressively driving. But in the year under review, we were able to reduce out headcount by 4%, chairperson,” says Kwele
