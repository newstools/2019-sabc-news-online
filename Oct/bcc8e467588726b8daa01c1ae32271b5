Farmers in the Karoo town of Graaff Reinet say they’re experiencing the worst drought in more than 40 years.  The last time the Eastern Cape town had a downpour was in February when it recorded 22 millimeters of rain. This has forced livestock producers to reduce their herds by between 50% to 70%. They’re now appealing to the government to intervene as the drought is crippling the town’s economy.
