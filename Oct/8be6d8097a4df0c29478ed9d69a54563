Businesswoman, Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe, wants investigations conducted in Botswana and South Africa after she was accused by Gaborone of being involved in a plan to topple President Mokgweetsi Masisi. Sunday Standard, a Tswana newspaper, ran a series of articles leading up to the recent elections in which it alleges that she was laundered money in support of regime change in that country. The paper also accused her of terrorism. “I’ve never been involved in money laundering. I’ve never been involved in the illicit outflow of capital. The affidavit says the stolen money from the Bank of Botswana was banked in an off-shore account. It says that this intelligence agent and I transferred the money from the off-shore account to Isaac Kgosi. I don’t know anything about it. I need a lot of investigations to be done, not just by the Judge Davis Commission but also from experts who are going to interrogate what’s really happening,” says Radebe.
