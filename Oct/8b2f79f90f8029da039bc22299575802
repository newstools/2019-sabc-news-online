The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry says the last nine days have reaffirmed his love for the African continent. Harry and his wife Meghan are on the last leg of their royal visit – with a visit to Johannesburg. They earlier announced that Britain would donate eight million pounds or close to R150 million towards skills development projects in South Africa. The couple will be heading back to London on Wednesday night. Harry has told young entrepreneurs in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg, that Africa is his second home. “I’ve often talked about Africa as my second home and I’ve often been asked why I love it so much. Well, over the last nine days I’ve been trying to put my feelings and experiences into words, which is not easy. I wanted to try and answer a more specific question to myself. What is the essence of Africa? Why is it that so many visitors feel Africa gets under our skin and into our soul? Africa has held me in an embrace that I will never forget and I’m feeling incredibly fortunate for that.” Related video below:
