President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will interact with potential investors to come and explore economic opportunities in the Free State. Speaking at the launch of the Integrated Human Settlements project in Bloemfontein, Ramaphosa says the move will revive the Free State economy. His arrival comes in a week in which the province convened its own investment conference in a bid to find ways of combating poverty and creating job opportunities. Ramaphosa says the private sector has a role to play. “They must also come and talk to our private sector here in the Free State; they must also come and talk to other investors so that we can attract investors to come to our country. We are going to showcase our country, showcase our provinces. I thank you that you helped me now to be able to showcase their faces and be able to show people what we’ve got to offer here in the Free State.” Click video below:  During the investment conference in the province, the Free State government highlighted that it needs to focus on tourism and manufacturing to boost the province’s economy. Mining has declined drastically, and the fall of textile industry has left many stranded. These are some of the issues that were at the centre of discussions during the investment conference held in Bloemfontein. Statistics indicate that Free State and the Eastern Cape take the lead when it comes to unemployment.  By hosting the conference, the Free State administration is hopeful to attract investors in an effort to combat poverty and high rate of unemployment.
