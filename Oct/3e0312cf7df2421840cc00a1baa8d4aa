World Day for Decent Work is commemorated each year on October 7, spearheaded by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) during which trade unions, union federations and other workers associations develop their actions to promote the idea of decent work across the globe. In South Africa the priority areas for decent work was developed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the SA Government, the private sector, labour unions and civil society. The purpose is to address a selected number of major decent work deficits in the country. This is in line with the ILO’s decent work agenda: “Productive employment and decent work are key elements to achieving a fair globalization and poverty reduction.” !function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");
