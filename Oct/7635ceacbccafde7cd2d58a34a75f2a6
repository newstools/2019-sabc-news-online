Post Office South Africa’s management says they are working tirelessly to step up security at Post Offices around the country. This follows a wave of armed robberies since the entity was tasked with transacting payouts for Sassa beneficiaries’ social grants. In a recent robbery, a group of twelve employees, their manager and a number of clients were held at gunpoint by robbers who demanded cash and cellphones at Hercules Post Office in Pretoria North. Post Office South Africa acting CEO Lindiwe Kwele says armed robberies have made it risky for the institution to operate with huge amounts of cash. “Once you start carrying cash it’s risky. So, this issue is not isolated to the Post Office incidents. We’ve seen ATMs being bombed; robberies in retail space. It’s a phenomenon in South Africa and what we’ve done we have stepped up security infrastructure, so that when you tamper with our cash that money gets tainted and gets replaced, but obviously, I cannot discuss in depth our security for security reasons,” Kwele says.
