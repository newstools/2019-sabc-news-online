As the Democratic Alliance (DA) battles to deal with three resignations of  top officials in less than a week, there has been some not so positive response from some social media users. On Wednesday afternoon, DA leader Mmusi Maimane and national chairperson Athol Trollip announced that they were resigning from the party’s leadership positions. But on Thursday morning, Maimane dropped another bombshell on Twitter announcing that he was resigning from the DA and Parliament.    DA MP, Phumzile van Damme took to Twitter to express his support and well wishes for Maimane.   DA chief whip John Steenhuisen also took the opportunity to share his experience working with Maimane.   But it was a video of former DA Cape Town mayor and now GOOD Party leader, Patricia De Lille that got many people talking. In the video De Lille is heard singing a song titled ‘Told You So’ , directed at Maimane, did the rounds on social media.       Some social media users have criticised the DA, accusing it of using its black leaders to get votes and only to fire them after the elections.       But despite all the drama, other DA leaders remain optimistic that the current situation will be a thing of the past soon.     The party’s federal executive leaders are expected to hold an urgent meeting on Thursday to discuss where to go from here.
