The South African Human Rights Commission says the complainants in the Eben Etzebeth matter have asked for financial compensation of over R1-million. The SAHRC has formerly lodged an application in the Equality Court for an alleged racist slur against Springbok lock. It will be heard in Hopefield on the West Coast. This follows allegations of assault and a racial slander incident in Langebaan in August. The South African Human Rights Commission held a media briefing in its Cape Town offices to explain the Equality Court process. Head of Legal Services Buang Jones says the court will determine whether Etzebeth contravened the Equality Act or not. Jones says there are currently four complainants on this matter. “We have since reconsidered our position as the Human Rights Commission, instead of embarking on a protracted investigation process, we should take this matter to the courts to pronounce on whether or not the allegations against Etzebeth are true or not.” SAHRC Commissioner Andre Guam says Etzebeth remains innocent until proven otherwise. The commission says it is not asking for Etzebeth’s recall from the World Cup, but that the law should take its course. Etzebeth has denied the allegations against him. Click video below:
