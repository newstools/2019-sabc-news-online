The case brought by Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) against former South African Airways (SAA) Chair, Dudu Myeni is expected to come before the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday. OUTA wants the court to declare Myeni a delinquent director. According to OUTA, Myeni failed to appear in court on Monday as she didn’t have her own lawyer in court. Judge Ronel Tolmay rolled the case over to Tuesday, to give Myeni a last chance to appear. If she fails to appear, the case is expected to continue without her. Myeni has been implicated in wrongdoing relating to her leadership at SAA. Former SAA executives and other witnesses have implicated Myeni at the State Capture Inquiry.
