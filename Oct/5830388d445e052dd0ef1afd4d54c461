President of the African Farmers’ Association of South Africa (Afasa), Dr Vuyo Mahlati says they are in constant discussions with the government in a bid to mitigate the impact of the drought on the farming community. Several parts of the country are currently in the grip of a devastating drought which is negatively affecting livestock and threatening food security. Addressing Afasa’s Agribusiness Transformation Conference in Bloemfontein, Mahlati said they were deeply concerned. “Yes, we have a challenge with drought at this point. We have seen it. I mean from the harvest, beginning of this year, it was not as expected because of the drought in various areas which include the Western Cape. We have seen the drought continuing and touching other provinces, but the big problem is that we are now getting into the planting season and still panicking even though we are working with the technocrats that include the agriculture research council.”
