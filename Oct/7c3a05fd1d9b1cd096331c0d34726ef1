Acting Legal Head for the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) Buang Jones has refuted allegations that it is biased. This comes after the Freedom Front Plus said the SAHRC had already found Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth guilty of assault and hate speech. Jones said on Thursday that they would use the rugby player to set an example of the consequences of hate speech in Langebaan in the Western Cape. Etzebeth is accused of assaulting two men in an alleged racial incident in August this year. Jones says they operate without prejudice, fear or favour. “The Commission has, in the recent past, taken the BLF to court. The Commission has taken other prominent individuals to court, has consistently dealt with cases of racism and hate speech. It is therefore not true that the Commission acted with haste in this matter involving Eben Etzebeth. The Commission received this complaint in August and that is why we’ve done it. It is on the basis of our constitutional mandate.” Watch related video below:
