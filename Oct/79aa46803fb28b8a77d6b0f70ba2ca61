A 25-year-old student from the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has been arrested by police after he allegedly killed and burnt his friend.  The deceased was also a student at the institution. Simukelo Zondi (24) went missing on Thursday and his girlfriend notified the police.  It is alleged that Zondi was last seen with his friend who lured him to the bushes before killing him. On Friday night the suspect is believed to have set his body alight with paraffin. When security guards at the university rushed to put out the fire, they saw the suspect emerging from bushes.  Upon seeing the guards the alleged killer fled the scene but he was apprehended after a chase. Zondi’s body had been partially burnt. It’s believed that he was also stoned to death. SAPS Spokesperson Jay Naiker says the suspect confessed to the murder. “The suspect was chased by police until he was apprehended by the security guards. The suspect told the guards that he had killed his friend.” Students say the pair were very close and often played soccer together. Family members of the victim were too traumatised to speak the SABC. The motive for the murder is still unknown. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon.
