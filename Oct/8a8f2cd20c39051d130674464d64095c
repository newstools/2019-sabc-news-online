The State Capture Commission will continue hearing testimony of Crime Intelligence official, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo in Parktown, Johannesburg on Tuesday morning. Naidoo, who is in a witness protection programme has been testifying through an audio link from a secret location since Friday. He blew the whistle on the alleged looting of millions, meant for intelligence work, to purchase luxury vehicles for the unit’s former head, Richard Mdluli and paying for overseas holiday trips for senior officials. On Monday,  Naidoo told the commission that 250 posts in Crime Intelligence were created to benefit Mdluli’s family and friends, and head of finance Solomom Lazarus. He says, “General Lazarus secured the undue appointment of his family, friends and associates. Those of us who were within General Lazarus’s inner circle received promotions often skipping a rank, I was promoted from Warrent Officer to Lt.Col. The Marimuthu family and friends also benefited from the association with General Lazarus, Mr Marimuthu himself was not appointed in this process, he was registered as a contact person and received a salary of R50 000 a month.” Watch video below:
