Convicted child rapist Nicholas Ninow  has been sentenced to life imprisonment for rape and five years for possession of drugs. He also received another five years in prison for defeating the ends of justice. Two of the sentences will run concurrently. Ninow had been convicted for the rape of a then seven-year-old girl at a restaurant in Silverton last year. High Court Judge Mokhine Mosopa says that Ninow showed no remorse for his crimes. “In the absence of the existence of substantial and compelling circumstances I’m going to sentence the accused in the following way: accused stand up – for rape you are sentenced to life imprisonment. Effective sentence is life imprisonment and five years.”  The state had recommended that life imprisonment be imposed against Ninow and a further five-year jail term for the possession of drugs. On Wednesday Ninow delivered an emotional testimony in court providing his version of events that led to him raping a seven-year old girl in a toilet cubicle at a Dros Restaurant in Pretoria. ‘Begging for leniency’ Ninow, who was 20 years old at the time of the offence, pleaded guilty to the charges but threatened to commit suicide if the court sent him to jail for life. Earlier he begged for leniency. His lawyer Herman Alberts argued that the court should take into consideration his client’s personal circumstances of growing under severe childhood abuse. Alberts asked the court not to overlook the probation officer’s report that recommends a lenient sentence. “Obviously the community is justifiably outraged at the commission of this offence. I have to accept that. But my submission is that the community’s call for vengeance should not be given.” Ninow told the court he was using drugs when the incident occurred. Watch for more:
