Western Cape Minister for Finance and Economic Opportunities David Maynier says stage two of load shedding by Eskom could cost the province up to R150 million per day and damage the local economy. The impact of load shedding is currently estimated to be R75 million per stage, per day for the Western Cape. Maynier said the provincial government has taken a number of actions to mitigate the impact of load shedding on the provincial economy. He said, “We have worked hard to ensure an energy secure province by diversifying our energy mix through the uptake of sustainable and low-carbon energy sources. We remain committed to engagement with business to ensure energy resilience in the province so that we can remain open for business.”
