The eThekwini municipality has launched a Disaster Relief Programme aimed at assisting flood victims.  More than 2 000 families, who lost everything in the April floods in the municipality, are expected to benefit from the programme. The municipality will facilitate the provision of building materials to the flood victims. eThekwini municipality’s Human Settlement and Infrastructure chairperson Thanduxolo Sabelo says there is a commitment that these families will receive housing. “ We have re-integrated them with the community here in New Germany road which has ablution facilities, water and electricity, but it remains an informal settlement and our commitment is that we are going to build houses for them. We are here in a place which has been properly investigated that in case of floods nothing actually happens and they are not washed away as it happened or did previously,” says Sabelo.
