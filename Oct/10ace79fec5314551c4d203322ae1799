Entrepreneurs in Durban have called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the allegations of ongoing corruption and major delays of cargo handling at the Durban Harbour. Addressing hundreds of entrepreneurs during an interactive session, Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industries Deputy President, Gladwin Malishe said the level of corruption is so high that it has a direct negative impact on the country’s economy. Entrepreneurs also called for the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the burning of trucks on national roads. Ramaphosa says the challenges faced by the ports around the country will be addressed urgently. “I am also going to talk to the minister to say that this is super urgent. This matter must be addressed urgently. Those suspensions and acting positions we need to solve. ” The president earlier expressed confidence in his drive to attract investors to the country. He was speaking at the launch of a privately-owned smartphone manufacturing plant at Dube Trade Port in Durban. The Rwandese company committed itself to invest over R1.5 billion over the next five years. Ramaphosa says there are reasons for South Africans to be optimistic. “Throughout the year there have been a number of projects, completed and launched. Today we are celebrating this one, last week here in eThekwini Toyota launched a R450 million investment additional capacity for its Hi-Ace plant in Prospecton. Now we are on the move, but sometimes we become so negative about the good things that are unfolding in our own country.”
