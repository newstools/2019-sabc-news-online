DA chief whip, John Steenhuisen has lambasted the Institute for Race Relations (IRR) for interfering in internal party politics. This follows an opinion piece which argued that current Western Cape premier; Alan Winde should replace Mmusi Maimane as party leader. The comments follow controversy over a car and house used by Maimane.  The IRR endorsed the article. The DA says it is looking into the allegations that former Steinhoff CEO, Markus Jooste sponsored Maimane’s car and that the house he declared as his own belonged to a Durban businessman. Maimane has denied the allegations.  Steenhuisen has reiterated that the car donation was made to the DA and not Maimane as an individual and that the vehicle was returned…  “I think that it completely farcical for them to even suggest that, because the main premise behind the article was that Alan Winde should be the leader of the DA, in the articles own words quote “because he is a white man”. This is quite astonishing proposals from the institution that seems to be promoting non-racialism in South Africa. Sure if you promote a candidate it should be on their ability and on their merit and not because of the colour of their skin.” Click on the related video below:  Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/752206">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
