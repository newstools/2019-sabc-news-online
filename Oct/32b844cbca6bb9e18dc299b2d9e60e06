Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has called on farmers to work with their local municipalities to ensure good quality water supply to towns.  She has addressed the national congress of AgriSA in Pretoria. Sisulu says if a town is without water and services are not restored within 24 hours she will fire the official. She says they have taken legal steps against municipalities. “Where we found that municipalities were negligent in their work and thus diminished the quality of water, we’ve taken legal action, we’ve taken legal action against a number of municipalities, however legal action is not enough. We have municipalities which are in dire need of support to understand the water environment and how to contain it and make sure everyone benefits from that.”
