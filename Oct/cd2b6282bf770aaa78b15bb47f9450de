Standard bank says it has never experienced any glitches on its internet platforms that could be related to cyber-attacks. This after the City of Jo’burg warned that, due to a network breach, several of its online systems – including its website, e-services and billing system have been shut down for 24-hours. In a Tweet, the City of Jo’burg says security experts are investigating the incident, which is expected to last 24-hours.  It has requested that any queries be directed to the city’s call centre – or that residents keep an eye on their Twitter updates. In a message sent out by a group calling itself the Shadow Kill Hackers, the hackers say they have compromised the City of Jo’burg’s data including passwords and financial information and threaten to publish it if a ransom of four Bitcoins is not paid to them by Monday. Meanwhile, The City of Johannesburg has assured customers that their personal data has not been compromised following a breach of its online system. City of Joburg spokesperson Nthatisi Modingoane says customers can call 113 to be assisted… “The call centre itself, the main call centre is not working as it is part of the entire system and residents are being directed to a particular number 113 where they can be assisted by the City of Johannesburg. At the moment we can confirm that the data is protected and we don’t anticipate anything that could have gone wrong with the data at the moment.” Modingoane also says they will not entertain any ransom claims… “The city will not entertain the issue of alleged ransom because there is no official demand that has been made on the city as yet. So we picked this on social media and other platforms but we cannot entertain such claims before they can be confirmed as official or as true.” Click on the video below:
