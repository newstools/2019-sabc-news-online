Sibanye-Stillwater says it is willing to find an amicable solution to end the dispute with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) over salary increases. Amcu says it will seek a minimum wage of R17 000 per month for its workers, up from R12 500. The union has taken Sibanye-Gold and Anglo American Platinum to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) over wage negotiations and planned retrenchments. Sibanye-Stillwater Corporate Affairs Executive Vice President Themba Nkosi says they are willing to negotiate to a point. He adds that they will not agree to a deal that would affect the long-term sustainability of the mine’s operations. Watch below for related news:
