Tshwane is running out of water in the Pretoria CBD and in the west of the City. Tshwane Metro Council has issued a statement saying Rand Water drastically reduced water to Gauteng due to shortages in the Vaal River system. Tshwane Metro spokeperson, Omogolo Taunyane, says because of the heatwave the City’s reservoirs are running dry. The City’s emergency operations center has started shutting down the irrigation systems to try and save water. Taunyane says water tankers have also been sent to the most affected areas in the capital. “Currently our water supply is running dry and that is because Rand Water is experiencing some shortages coming from the Vaal River. So what is currently being put in place is that we supply water tankers to the communities that are most affected and we will be hearing about an emergency plan from the Minister of Water and Sanitation on Monday.”
