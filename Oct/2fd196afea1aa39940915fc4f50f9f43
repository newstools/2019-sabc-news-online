Johannesburg residents will know soon – if city Mayor Herman Mashaba will remain in his position. Mashaba has announced a press conference for 10 o’clock on Monday morning – where he’s expected to announce his resignation from the position.  This follows the election on Sunday of Helen Zille – as the party’s Federal Council Chairperson.  Mashaba indicated last week that he would call it quits – should, what he called “the right-wing aligned DA faction” – win. He announced the presser – shortly after Zille was elected.
