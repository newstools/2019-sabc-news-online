The unavailability of water in the Kimberley area has now affected teaching and learning. The Sol Plaatje municipality shutdown the water supply last Wednesday to upgrade the infrastructure and the water was supposed to be back on Friday. On Monday, schools called  parents to fetch their children from school an hour after dropping them off. Parents of learners at  Staats Primary School say they are now at the receiving end of the crisis. “Some of us parents stay far from Staats so I had to walk 45 minutes from home to come and fetch him and I actually have to work, I am a single parent and I have to work,”says one parent. “It is actually frustrating because the  kids are also preparing for the exams, in a month or two they will be writing their exams,”adds another frustrated parent.
