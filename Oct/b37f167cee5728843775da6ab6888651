President of the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) in Botswana Duma Boko says he is optimistic that his party has performed well in the elections. He cast his vote at Masa Primary School in Gaborone. The UDC is the main opposition and one of the four political parties contesting in this year’s elections. During the last general elections in 2014, the UDC obtained 20 seats out of 57 which were up for grabs. This was the highest number of seats obtained by an opposition party since the country gained independence from Britain in 1966. “I am extremely elated that I have lived to this moment. It’s a very epic moment. It’s a very humbling moment looking at the prospects, looking at what this moment portends; that the very next day it may be totally different. We may be looking at a spectacularly different future from what we’ve had so far,” says Boko. Meanwhile, Botswana’s Independent Electoral Commission hopes that more than half of registered voters cast their ballots. Of the more than 1 million illegible voters, 925 000 people registered for the poll. The Commission says no major incidents were reported across the country. Counting began after voting stations closed at 19:00. Watch the video below for more:  Report by Sentleeng Lehihi & Itumeleng Kgajane
