The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NCID) has reassured the public that there is no outbreak of listeriosis in any part of the country. This is despite 21 people who have died as a result of contracting the disease. The NCID says the number of cases reported since the official end of the 2017/2018 listeriosis outbreak is well within the expected range for sporadic disease. The NICD says since the announcement at the end of the outbreak in September last year, 87 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in the country. In a statement, the NCID states that “outcome data is currently available for 77% (67/87) of cases, of which 31% (21/67) died.” During the outbreak, 1064 cases were reported and more than 200 died. Since September 2018, most of the reported cases occurred in Gauteng with 31, followed by Western Cape with 23 and KwaZulu-Natal with 16 cases.
