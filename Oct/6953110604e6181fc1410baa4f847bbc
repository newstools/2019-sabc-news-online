Deputy President David Mabuza has committed R30-million in immediate relief for farmers in the Northern Cape. Drought has ravaged the province for the past six years with devastating losses in livestock and crops. Farmworkers have also lost their jobs. Mabuza says government will do everything it can to ensure that farms are saved and food security is secured. “Their situation is very dire and we came with some short term measures to supply them with fodder to help them with their animals that are dying. There are almost less than 50% of their stock that is alive. But beyond that we want to find a medium term solution.” Click video below:
