Nelson Mandela Bay metro embattled mayor Mongameli Bobani can breathe a sigh of relief for now. A special council meeting that was meant to decide his fate as mayor has now been cancelled. However, the cancellation has now erupted another storm in the teacup. It’s uncertain why the meeting was cancelled, but police are denying they gave any security advice to cancel the meeting. The real reason for cancelling the meeting now remains a mystery. The United Democratic Front (UDF), which holds a seat in the council, picketed outside chambers on Thursday morning. The party supports Bobani for mayor. The Democratic Alliance (DA) council members and its partners from the Congress of the People (COPE) and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) also showed up at chambers. But there was no meeting. They are still adamant the mayor must go. The African National Congress (ANC) through its regional task team also says the mayor must go and that a cancelled council meeting does not change its position. The mayor responded that he will continue to ensure unity in the black caucus and that services are delivered. ANC member and mayoral committee member, Andile Lungisa, defied his regional structures and expressed his support for the mayor. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said earlier this week it would abstain in the vote if the motion went ahead. A new council meeting must now be called within the next two weeks.
