Deputy President David Mabuza says economic and trade relations between South Africa and China signify an ever-growing partnership. He was speaking at the start of a week-long visit to the Middle Kingdom, where he is tasked with strengthening ties between the two countries. On Tuesday, he toured the capital, Beijing, ahead of the Seventh Bi-National South Africa China Committee set to kick off on Thursday. The day began with a tour of Mao Zedong Memorial Hall, where the Deputy President paid his respects to China’s founding father. It was followed by a tour of the Forbidden City. The main purpose of this visit is to cement relations… and to promote areas of mutual benefit. The Bi-National Committee is seen as the main vehicle for bridging ties between South Africa and China. The last such gathering took place in 2016. Over the next few days the two nations will use the opportunity to find a new way forward in bilateral relations. The commission is also expected to review and issue a report on the progress the two sides have made since they last met, in areas including foreign relations, trade and agriculture. One key challenge for the Deputy President is to find more ways for South African businesses to expand into the world’s second largest economy. If the two countries can identify more ways of supporting one another, the partnership could yet reach new heights.  Watch the video below for more on the story:
