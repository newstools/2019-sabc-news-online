The Communication and Digital Technology Department has rolled out tablets and digital television sets to schools in the Vhembe district. The donation is part of the cyber safety awareness campaign that will educate learners and communities on cyber-crimes. Deputy Minister of Communication and Digital Technology Pinky Kekana handed over Information and Communications Technology (ICT) certificates to 60 women from Vhembe district on digital literacy. Kekana said the campaign will educate the learners and educators about cybersecurity and this is also part of the broadband distribution in the region. Kekana said that by 2020 they would have connected all the schools, clinics and hospitals they have been working on as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and National Health Insurance (NHI). The 60 women were trained by the department in partnership with the Siyafunda Foundation. The program started in 2018. One of the trainees, Radzilani Mokgadi says the training will help them in starting their own businesses. ”The Siyafunda people have thought us how to use computers to grow our business and to save business data and other things. This will help us in our business.”
