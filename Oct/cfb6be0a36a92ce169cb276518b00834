Speaker of the Nelson Mandela Bay Council Buyelwa Mafaya has cancelled the council meeting where the no confidence motion in Mayor Mongameli Bobani was due to be debated on Thursday. The motion of no confidence against him has been postponed due to a perceived security risk. The United Front indicated earlier this week that its party supporters will protest outside the chambers in support of Bobani. Bobani’s coalition partners, the African National Congress (ANC) and the African Independent Congress (AIC), as well as opposition parties led by the Democratic Alliance (DA) want to remove him. Although all the parties are in agreement that Bobani must be removed, they’re at loggerheads over who should be Bobani’s successor. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) withdrew from voting in the motion of no confidence due to a disagreement over who should take over as mayor. The two front runners for the position, although their parties refuse to comment on them, is DA Caucus leader Athol Trollip and ANC former mayor Nceba Faku. Click on the related videos below:
