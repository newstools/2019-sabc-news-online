The Gauteng provincial government has reiterated that the delay in reshuffling its executive to meet the gender parity policy was not in defiance of the African National Congress’ NEC. Premier David Makhura announced in a statement on Friday, the appointment of Morakane Mosupyoe as the new Economic Development MEC, replacing Kgosientso Ramakgopa – following pressure from the NEC for greater female representation in his executive. Makhura was instructed to replace a male member of the executive council with a female, in line with the NEC’s resolution that where a premier is male, 60% of the executive must be women.
