The trial in the murder case of nine-year-old primary school learner Miguel Louw will continue in the High Court in Durban on Monday. It’s alleged that Louw was kidnapped and murdered by Mohammed Ebrahim in Durban in July 2018. The boy’s decomposed body was found ten days later in bushes close to Ebrahim’s home in Phoenix, north of Durban. The court has heard testimony from two juvenile witnesses and a police officer Colin Chetty who discovered Louw’s badly decomposed body. CCTV footage from a fast food outlet allegedly shows Louw in the company of the accused on the day he went missing. Ebrahim has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, kidnapping and theft.
