The Health Department is working with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to develop digital platforms to run National Health Insurance. This has been revealed by Doctor Nicolas Crisp who is part of the National Health Insurance team in the Department of Health. He has been speaking at a roundtable discussion with the media in Rosebank, Johannesburg. Crisp says they will conduct a lot of research on digital solutions. He says, “We’ve got to do away with paper, we’ve got to put more power in the hands of the clinicians, the professionals in the periphery of the system and the way to do that in the fourth industrial revolution is to go digital.” “So right now we are spending a lot of effort, a lot of money and a lot of heartache if you like especially with the CSIR as a partner to develop the digital platform to run the NHI fund, that includes of the accredited service providers, all the users who register on the system and all the procurement that has to happen on the system, everything ,” Crisp adds.
