The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has raised concerns over the growing number of vacant posts not being filled due to budgetary constraints. The NPA said the organisation has been placed in a very precarious position and is under immense strain due to financial constraints which are impeding its functions. This comes after the National Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Shamila Batohi briefed Parliament’s justice oversight committee on the NPA’s annual report this week. Batohi said her team is working to turn the NPA around. NPA spokesperson Bulelwa Makeke said, “Our vacancies are very high, over 20 percent. It is one of the results of not having enough capacity – not being able to recruit and when people at the NPA leave we can’t replace them… that is a big factor on how the service is delivered and the impact is that there are less prosecutors available.” WATCH
