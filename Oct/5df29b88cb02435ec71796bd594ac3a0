Motorists in North West have been warned to avoid the N-12 highway linking Klerksdorp and Christiana as well as the alternative R34 route through Bloemhof due to ongoing violent protests. On Monday night at least two trucks and a car were damaged when residents of the trouble-strife Boitumelong Township pelted motorists with stones. A truck driver was also stopped and robbed of his personal belongings. All services, including schools, businesses and transport network are closed. Residents of Boitumelong say they are concerned over the safety of their children and the elderly following the arrest of members of the anti-gang committee. They were arrested for allegedly assaulting several suspected gang members in the area. Residents say the gangs are terrorising them. “ They were raping old people and small children. These people helped me to find those people,” says a resident. “We can’t rest now because we are scared for these kids at the location. The innocent people are inside, for what?” adds another resident. “It affects the business and staff and town and economy of the country at the end of the day,” says a resident.
