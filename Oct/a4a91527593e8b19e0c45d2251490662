President Cyril Ramaphosa recognises South Africa and Nigeria’s role in the strengthening and promotion of economic integration on the African continent in his “From the Desk of the President” letter on Monday. In the letter Ramaphosa said the meeting with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari cemented the relation between the two countries and solidified the role the countries, as the largest economies in Africa, can play in the future of the continent. The President said Nigeria and South Africa’s efforts to build stronger ties have been challenged by the violence that rocked the county in recent months. He emphasised the need to work towards economic integration of the continent as envisaged by the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA) signed in March 2018. Ramaphosa says, “South Africa’s future lies in Africa. It is through our trade with the rest of the continent that we will grow our industries. The African marketplace is where our companies will increasingly find trading and investment opportunities. It is expected that over the next few decades there will be a massive increase in investment in infrastructure across Africa, which should benefit South African construction companies, manufacturers and banks.” In closing the President said, African integration is overwhelmingly and undeniably in South Africa’s national interest.
