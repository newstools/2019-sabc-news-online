Protesting Northern Cape residents have torched a municipal building at Ritchie, near Jacobsdal. The Sol Plaatje Municipality has condemned the incident which they claim happened in full view of the police. Residents, who went on the rampage, are demanding better services from the local municipality. They want Premier Zamani Saul to intervene and speed up the eradication of the bucket system and deliver better uninterrupted municipal services. One of the protestors, Shadrack Metsimetsi had this to say. “The community feels that the councillor did not take them into confidence, and that’s why the community brought also to the attention of the premier through the issue of the memorandum, that both councillors – councillor Norman hammer and councillor Bonisile Makhamba – must step down with immediate effect. That is the issue the community raised to the premier. Today’s violence is precisely because the premier is reluctant to respond to the grievances and the memorandum of the community.”
