The Mozambique Consulate in Mbombela, Mpumalanga says voting has been running smoothly in most of the polling stations in Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Mozambicans are voting in the general elections. FRELIMO, which has ruled Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975, is again expected to beat its arch-rival RENAMO, a former rebel group. Consul for the two provinces, Eugenio Langa, says they have set up 97 voting stations in Mpumalanga and Limpopo. “Yes we faced some problems and challenges concerning the farm workers because it was difficult to have the Mozambicans who were there. The other challenge is because some of the Mozambicans who were not having proper documentation and others are living here for a very long time, they had to have witnesses and all of that. So these are the major challenges but the rest went smoothly and we have corporation from Home Affairs, the South African Police and the South African government,” says Langa.  !function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");  Watch a related video below:
