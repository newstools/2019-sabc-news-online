Mmusi Maimane has stepped down as the leader of the Democratic Alliance. He will, however, continue as the Parliamentary leader of the official opposition. Speaking at the DA headquarters in Bruma, on Wednesday, Maimane says he has worked hard to grow the party. “I have relentlessly sought to grow the party to all South Africans and more specifically, black South Africans. I indeed, fundamentally, believed that if the DA was to become a party of government, it needed to look, to feel and it needed to be a home and a place that will belong to all South Africans.”  Maimane says he will continue in the role as parliamentary leader until the end of the year, after which the party will go to Congress to elect new leadership. He has thanked DA voters for their support in his journey as the party leader, adding that he will remain committed to building a non-racial South Africa. “I am not a career politician and I have never sought to be one. I have always been driven by a vision to building a united, prosperous, reconciled South Africa, where all citizens have a fair shot in life; where the colour of your skin does not determine your future prospects. In order to do so, it was always crucial that the DA grow and transform into a party that all South Africans can call home – a truly South African party.”  Read Maimane’s media release below:
