The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court has denied #FeesMustFall activist Kanya Cekeshe‘s application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with three years suspended in 2017 after pleading guilty to burning a police van at the height of the #FeesMustFall protests in 2016. Earlier, dozens of Economic Freedom Fighters Student command activists gathered outside the court hoping that Cekeshe would be released on bail to enable him to continue with his studies. Cekeshe’s new legal team led by by Advocate Thembeka Ngukaitobi believes that his previous legal team misled him leading to his conviction for public violence and malicious damage to property. President of the EFF student command Mandala Shikwambana said they would not stop fighting for Cekeshe’s release. “If Kanya is not granted bail, we are going to push. We are going to visit Ministry of Justice. We want Kanya to be released,” said Shikwambana.
