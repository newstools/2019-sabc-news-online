Lebo Tshangela and Mayleen Vinvent The University of South Africa’s  Nanotechnology and Water Sustainability Research Unit is looking at technologies that will absorb heavy metals found in acid mine drainage polluted water. Much of the focus and publicity has been around the acid mine drainage crisis in the Witwatersrand, due to the areas historical gold mining activity. However, this problem affects the entire country as mining is critical to the economy. According to the South Africa Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), acid mine drainage has been reported in a number of areas, including the Witwatersrand gold fields, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal coal fields, and the O’Kiep copper district. The Western, Central and Eastern Basins are identified as priority areas requiring immediate action because of, among other things, the urgency of implementing intervention measures before problems become more critical and the proximity to densely populated areas. Acid mine drainage occurs when water comes into contact with exposed rock surfaces that are rich in sulphates, particularly iron sulphate also known as pyrite. The metals then dissolve out of the rock together with sulphates which results in the formation of sulphuric acid. The water that then contains both metals and sulphuric acid, and is therefore acidic. Water purification techniques Acid mine drainage has various effects on human health such as skin irritation, kidney damage, and neurological diseases amongst others. The Unit’s Dr Lueta de Kock says, “We are looking at technologies that will absorb or take up the metal that are in the acid mine drainage, so therefore to remove them from the aquatic environment and part of the work we do is also then once we have removed the metals from the water, we can then separate them out and recover them so that they become a resource rather than a waste or a by-product.” De Kock says the focus of her research is two-fold as she is looking at water purification techniques coupled with resource recovery. “So we looking at system that we can use to clean water.  Most of these focus on iron exchange or lignite exchange systems and the idea being not only that will we produce clean water but we can recover resources from the water. So one of the resources we can recover from acid mine drainage would be iron, that is a major component from the gold mine acid mine drainage, we can recover aluminium and we can then possibly use those recovered resources to cover some of the costs of treating the water.” De Kock adds that there are several projects running, two of which are at the point where small scale pilot studies may begin where a couple of a hundred litres per day will be treated on a continuous basis. How do we scale it up? Do that and we can end up trading thousands or hundreds of thousands of litres of water per day. Pilot project at Cradle of Humankind There is a large scale facility at the Cradle of Humankind which is piloting a process that uses high density sludge. Limestone, calcium carbonate are added to the acidic water which causes the pH to increase and this results in the metals precipitating out as sludge. De Kock says, “High density sludge means that we basically dewater that sludge so that it’s got a smaller volume, the water that is purified by that process then passes through a reverse osmosis membrane, after that it’s very pure. However, that process forms two waste products: the first is the sludge itself and the second is what we call the brine solution from the reverse osmosis process. And that is what is left after the clean water has passed through the membrane.” She adds, “We’re currently looking at what we can do with the sludge and with the brine to firstly recover more water from those products but also turn them into something that now is no longer a waste but it’s potentially a useful product.” But, De Kock warns that acid mine drainage is dangerous and poisonous to humans and the environment. Short-term treatment of acid mine drainage Federation for a Sustainable Environment CEO, Mariette Liefferink says between 2002 and 2012 acid mine water from the Pamodzi mine had been allowed to flow into the receiving environment without any intervention or mitigation. Liefferink says the Department of Water Affairs then decided to implement the short-term treatment of acid mine drainage that affected the central basin as a result of significant whistleblowing by advocacy groups. !function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"); Diluting of Water not the solution Although efforts have been made by the Department of Water and Sanitaion, Liefferink says the short-term treatment for acid mine drainage is recognised by the department itself as an incomplete process. “That was why there was a launch by our former minister of water and sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane, for the long term treatment of acid mine drainage. However, it was supposed to be implement by 2014 to 2015 in order to address the high salinity in the Vaal river system because neutralized acid mine water still contains a significant salt or high salinity but it was delayed and may only now be implemented by 2022 or 2023. Which will impose risks on the water availability within the Vaal River system.” Corrosive impact of AMD on the environment !function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"); According to Mariette Liefferink, South Africa has “splendid legistlation”. The acts outline the definition of pollution, who is to be held liable for causing pollution and and for what period of time the remedial action should take place to correct the damage caused by pollution. “It’s no defence to say that the pollution occurred historically,” Liefferink argues, as this is a common position taken by mine owners. !function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"); She says, “Either restoration must take place to a predetermined condition, a pre-mining condition, or rehabilitation or remediation to a sustainable land use….it must be with consultation with interested and affected parties because they are the future land users.” “If a mining company ceases operation or when it’s mining right or permit lapses, then a mining company must apply to the department of mineral resources, the minister of department mineral resources, for a closure certificate. That closure certificate, if it is issued, would then determine the ground water and surface water is fit for use, the air quality has been addressed the soil is fit for use and the vegetation is fit for use,” she explains further. However, this does not seem to be the case for the residents of Riverlea, south of Johannesburg, which sits between two mine tailings. The community forum’s Mark Kayser says, “The mine stopped operations in 2017 yet by 2019 little in the way of rehabilitation can be seen.” Exasperated by the lack of action Kayser says, “DMR (Department of Mineral Resources) told us in a meeting in December 2017 that they were ready to start the rehabilitation process….but to date nothing has happened.” Despite huge misgivings about the accountability and negative environmental impact of mining, Liefferink explains that mining applications are being authorised in environmentally sensitive areas, “At the moment many mining applications being authorised in wetlands, within a sources of the river system, within pans in areas of fresh water ecosystems.” Department acknowledges threat of mining on water resources Department of Water and Sanitation Spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau says the department is looking into mine pollution. “In essence, the area of mine pollution is something that the department is looking at very strongly because we are aware that the impact on the environment and on the resource is such that it is not sustainable for us to continue without looking at the issue and correcting it.” Ratau says, “You must remember that this emanates from 150 years of mining that has been happening in the country and therefore it’s not something that is going to be resolved as quickly as possible. But in the same vein what we want say moving forward, included in the water use licences we will be issuing – we should be able to look at the fact that there must be the issue of insuring, that there is strong emphasis on corrective measures in terms of the water quality or the affluence that then gets discharged into the environment after or during the operation.” <a href="https://iono.fm/e/750416">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
