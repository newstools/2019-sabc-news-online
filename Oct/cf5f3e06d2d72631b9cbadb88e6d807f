The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in Gauteng has expressed confidence in the newly elected leadership at its conference in Ekurhuleni. It believes the team will be able to grow the party in the province. Bonginkosi Dlamini has retained his position as a provincial chairperson. IFP national spokesperson, Mkhuleko Hlengwa says more is expected from this new leadership ahead of the 2021 local government elections. “The party expects the IFP to continue to play a constructive role in its opposition in the provincial legislature; and to make sure that the gains of 2016 local government elections are further built upon. As we know that the IFP is in corporations in the city of Johannesburg and is key maker in some of the municipalities. Therefore we expect the IFP to strengthen its footing and to go flat out in terms of membership drive branch renewal ahead of 2021 local government elections,” says Hlengwa.
