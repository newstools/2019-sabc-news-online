Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has lost his hate speech case against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and leader Julius Malema in the Equality Court. In handing down judgement Judge Roland Sutherland says while the comments may indeed be hateful, they do not fall within the terms of the Equality Act. In 2018, Gordhan lodged a case against Malema over remarks he made outside the state capture inquiry venue. Malema accused Gordhan of being a “dog of white monopoly capital.”
