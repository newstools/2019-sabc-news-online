African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte has confirmed that the party is in talks with other political parties to replace outgoing Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. Duarte was briefing the media in Johannesburg about the launch of the party’s renewal programme. Mashaba announced his resignation as both the mayor and member of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday. His resignation follows the election of Helen Zille as the party’s Federal Council Chairperson. Mashaba has previously indicated that he would call it quits, should – what he calls – the ‘right-wing aligned DA faction’ win. Duarte says they are looking at their relationships with other parties. “There are discussions happening but we have no final view as yet and I think it will take. We need to explore where we are as the ANC component in Johannesburg. We need to look at the relationships we have with other political parties. It isn’t a one-day event matter, it’s quite a long drawn out process,” says Duarte. Watch Herman Mashaba’s resignation announcement:
