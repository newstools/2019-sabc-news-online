Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, has urged learners to conduct themselves with honesty during the National Senior Certificate exams, adding that cheating and other exam irregularities may result in a criminal record. Grade 12 learners across the country will sit for English Paper One on Wednesday. Lesufi will visit Park Town Boys High school in Johannesburg to oversee the exams. The school was rocked by allegations of misconduct against teachers. A former waterpolo coach at the school, Collan Rex, was sentenced to 23 years in prison after pleading guilty to 144 counts of sexual and common assault. “We wish to call upon everyone to support our learners. Let’s make sure that we work with them. To learners, focus, it is the last push,” says Steve Mabona, Gauteng Education spokesperson. Watch a related video below:
