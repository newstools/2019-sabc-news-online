The African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape has fired the Mayor and Speaker of the Phokwane Municipality after they went against party policy and voted with the opposition on organisational matters. The now former mayor, Crocket Adams, who was not the party’s preferred candidate, was found guilty of violating the party’s constitution after occupying the position despite the disapproval of the region and the province’s disapproval. Frances Baard regional spokesperson, Tshepo Louw, says the disgraced mayor and speaker have 21 days to appeal their expulsion. “The ANC believes that discipline is the only glue that holds an organisation together like any other self-respecting political party and there is no room in the ANC for leaders and members to disrespect or to defy mandates of the ANC hence the disciplinary committee came to conclusion to expel two of its members,” says Louw.
