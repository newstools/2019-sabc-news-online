Scores of pastor Timothy Omotoso supporters have braved the cold Port Elizabeth weather and gathered outside the Port Elizabeth High Court in support of Omotoso. The court case of controversial pastor and his two co-accused is expected to proceed at 14:00 on Monday. In the last court appearance, presiding Judge, Irma Schoeman dismissed Omotosoâ€™s application for leave to appeal against her decision to allow the trial to be heard in Port Elizabeth. The case was previously postponed to allow his legal team to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal. The results of this petition are expected to be heard on Monday.  Watch video below:
