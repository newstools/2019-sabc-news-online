President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged South Africans against worrying over the landing of two so-called Black Jack Russian long-range bomber jets in the country, saying they pose no threat as they are unarmed. The two nuclear-capable jets, which were dispatched by Russia, landed at the Waterkloof AirForce Base on Wednesday. They form part of a fleet of Russian Aerospace Forces and are being used in military exercises while in the country. Ramaphosa was speaking on the side-lines of an African Heads of State Summit in the southern Russian city of Sochi. “Russia and SA have long had dealings at a military level, we do exchange a number of activities. They are huge planes and the good thing is that as much as they are huge bombers, nuclear bombers, they are not armed. We should never worry because our air force people went in and looked at these planes and the technology they have and carry and it’s something that is good. We should never look at the negative side of it,” explains Ramaphosa. Watch related video:
