Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says the updated economic strategy, first published by the Treasury in August, will be presented at the Medium Term Budget  Policy Statement (MTBPS).  The plan has received more than 750 public comments. However, Mboweni says not all comments will be incorporated into the final version. Speaking at a media briefing in Pretoria, Mboweni says the documents had inputs from, among others, economists, the African National Congress (ANC) national executive and Cabinet. “Ideas which are internally consistent with what we do, we should incorporate. But those which are internally inconsistent, we should just appreciate the contribution. Somebody who says that in order to get the economy going, we should abandon inflation targeting … that is inconsistent with our mandate; we can’t do that,” says Mboweni. Mboweni is set to present the MTBPS to Parliament on October 30th.
