A former Non-Executive Board member of Eskom, Mark Pamensky, says he was appointed to the Eskom board while he was a director at the Gupta-owned Oakbay Resources and Energy.  Pamensky says he was appointed as director by Atul Gupta. Pamensky says he sat on the board of 20 other local and international companies. He says he attended his first board meeting at Eskom in January 2015. He further says the R43 million contract for the Gupta’s defunct New Age TNA breakfast was not discussed at the meeting. Pamensky says he made disclosures of his perceived conflicts of interests to the Department of Public Enterprises before accepting his appointment to the Eskom board. Pamensky is responding to questions posed by advocate Kate Hofmeyr at the State Capture Commission in Parktown in Johannesburg. “I was called to a meeting by Mr Atul Gupta who explained to me that they are listing a subsidiary of theirs called Oakbay Resources and Energy, which it had a subsidiary called Shiva Uranium. It was involved in Uranium, in the gold industry and they were looking for independent, non-executive directors to join their boards.” Pamensky says that he had no engagements with Atul Gupta prior to this meeting, but had met Tony Gupta at his house in Saxonwold in June.
