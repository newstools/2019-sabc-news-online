Parliament cannot ignore the allegations levelled against the Special Investigating Unit Head Andy Mothibi. That’s according to Chairperson of Parliament’s Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio Committee Bulelani Magwanishe who was speaking during a committee meeting. He wants Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola to urgently investigate the allegations against Mothibi and the SIU. Some of the allegations include sexual harassment and corruption. Magwanishe says that Parliament has received more complaints against the SIU Head. “I think we received a lot of letters after the appearance of the SIU before the committee. And Parliament cannot be seen to be ignoring such complaints. I proposed, Honourable Members, that this matter be referred to as a matter of urgency to the Minister, to investigate and deal with the matter and report to the Committee urgently. Possibly when we come back early next year, we would request him to update the committee on the actions he would have taken to deal with the matter. But we think that the matter should be dealt with expeditiously to look at the veracity of all the allegations that are made and to take appropriate steps to deal with the matter.”
