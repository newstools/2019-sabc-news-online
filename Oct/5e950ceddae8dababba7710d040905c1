The Western Cape government says it has paid 99 % of all invoices for goods and services within 30 days to all it’s suppliers for the 2018/2019 financial year. Western Cape Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier, says the prompt payments to suppliers will ensure that businesses in the province will continue to grow and more jobs will be created. Maynier says the provincial government remains committed to working with businesses to grow the economy in the Western Cape. ” The Western Cape government is proud of our track record in paying suppliers within 30 days. It would simply be wrong if government was responsible for the closure of a business due to the late payment of invoices. A thriving private sector is critical to the growth of the economy in the Western Cape. As the Western Cape Government, we are open for business.”
