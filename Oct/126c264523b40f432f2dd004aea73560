The face of education in Gauteng continues to change as the department launches yet another platform aimed at enhancing paperless education in the province. The department’s new e-Learning Content and Online Assessment Platform will see learners accessing their lesson plan, homework and all learning materials online. Textbooks and all study materials are uploaded, making it possible for learners to catch up on lessons in the comfort of their own homes – using laptops and mobile phones. The platform also offers audio visual tutorials.  Learners can even write their assessments on the platform, which are marked automatically. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi launched the platform at Soshanguve East Secondary School, North of Pretoria. “We are not doing this because we are bored, we are doing this because we want you to compete with the best children anywhere in the world, we want you to be amongst the best in the world and that is why we are giving this to you.”
