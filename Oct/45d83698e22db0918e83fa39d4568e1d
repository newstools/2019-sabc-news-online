The Mozambique Election Commission says all voter materials have been dispatched to various regions of the country ahead of the general elections on Tuesday, October 15th. The Commission says 26 political parties are campaigning for elections. It says it is confident that it will administer free and fair elections in which RENAMO will for the first time contest power without opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama. The Commission’s spokesperson Paul Cuinica says for the first time ten governors will be chosen from the competing parties. “The political parties are campaigning until the 12, we have had some incidents, like that one of propaganda materials destruction and we also have some clashes here and over there, but we would say that so far this has let us say a smooth campaign in spite of this incident. But we think that the problems that are happening here and over there have been controlled by the police.”  WATCH RELATED VIDEO:
