The African National Congress’ (ANC) National Youth Task Team (NYTT) that was recently appointed by the party’s executive committee says that the league is now able to host their national elective conference in 2020, thanks to the ANC paying their debt. The ANC’s Youth League (ANCYL) had been placed under liquidation because it owed service providers millions of rands. The task team however did not want to specify the exact amount. The NYTT was appointed after the ANCYL, under the then president Collen Maine, was disbanded recently. The National spokesperson of ANC, Pule Mabe, says the ANC Youth League is established in terms of the constitution of the ANC. “The same constitution empowers ANC to supervise and oversee the work of its organs… this include the ANC Youth League.” “It is in the interest of the ANC that the youth league is continues to operate discharges its mandate, fulfills its responsibility to be a rallying point for young people in the country behind the banner of the African National Congress,” says Mabe.
