The current heat wave in Gauteng is expected to continue until Monday despite rainfall in some parts of the province on Saturday. Some parts of Tshwane, including Laudium and Attridgeville have been without water since Friday due to low water pressure linked to electricity issues. Organisations representing the residents of Laudium have expressed their disgust at the situation, saying that they are receiving little help from Rand Water, the Gauteng government and the Tshwane Metro to resolve the problem. Tshwane Executive Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa says Rand Water has cut the city’s water supply by nearly 50 per cent. He urged residents to use water sparingly to ensure the city doesn’t run dry. “As a city we are calling on the residents to be very much circumstant and ensure that they save water. Simple basic things that need to be done, like not filling the swimming pool or watering the grass. Those basic things can save water because every drop counts. We are strategically working with Rand Water and there will be a press conference with the department on Monday just to allay the fears of residents. But the clarion call we are making here to the residents of Tshwane is to save water as much as possible.”
