Former Economic Development MEC in Gauteng, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, has pledged his full support for the provincial government’s decision to replace him with a woman. Gauteng Premier David Makhura announced that Morakane Mosupyoe would replace Ramokgopa following pressure from the African National Congress National Executive Committee (ANC NEC) for greater female representation in the executive. Speaking to the SABC, Ramokgopa says he will continue serving in the provincial government and practice as a civil engineer. “We have full confidence in her. After this, I am going to continue to discharge my responsibilities as a member of the Provincial Executive Committee, Provincial Working Committee and then also apply my skills going back to my practice as a civil engineer. If the ANC needs determination in the future, feels like there’s a deployment that is appropriate for me to consider, I will most certainly do that. This action really is not out of some expectations so there are no trade-offs, it’s just Gauteng recommitting itself to the struggles for women.” Click below to watch Former MEC Kgosientso Ramokgopa‘s interview with the SABC:
