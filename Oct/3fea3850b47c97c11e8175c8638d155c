The Gauteng Department of Education says it has identified 21 problematic schools in the province with high rates of bullying. It was reacting to the death of a 14-year old learner who was stabbed to death inside a classroom at the Thuto Tiro Comprehensive School in Sebokeng in the Vaal on Monday. Spokesperson Steve Mabona says a programme will soon be finalised to assist learners with behaviour problems. “Remember we have identified 20-schools which are problematic with ill-discipline, drug peddling, drug abuse and the bullying… and we said we need to have 5 000-of those learners coming from those schools. We have 21-schools which we know they’re problematic, will take them through a programme where there will be professional help just to divert their behaviour; we will guide them on how to behave in a school environment and in the society at large,” says Mabona.
