African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned that anyone who seeks to divide the governing party is the enemy of the movement. Addressing ANC members and supporters in Bloemfontein, Ramaphosa called on party members to unite and preserve organisational integrity. He stressed that unity is not based on lies and corruption.  The ANC in the Free State has previously had to contend with fierce power struggles which involved several court actions by disgruntled members. This is not the first time Ramaphosa has used such a platform to issue a strong warning to his detractors. Last month during the Memorial lecture of the late former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Durban, Ramaphosa said party members must prove those who want to further divide the organisation wrong. “I hope when we go to the NGC (National General Council) next year mid-year, we will be able to solidify that unity to take us the 55th conference. So those who say comrades we will see who stands with who and how. We must disappoint them and prove them wrong.” Related video click below:
