The Legal Practitioners Fidelity Fund has raised an alarm over fraud in the legal fraternity. The organisation says it settled over 400 fraud claims at a cost of R171-million last year alone. The organisation reimburses clients who have been defrauded by their attorneys and certain advocates. CEO Motlatsi Molefe says the fund uses legal services to protect consumers against the theft of money or property. “Conveyancing claims have always been a problem, second category generally that you get is the motor claims, the so called Road Accident Fund claims… they probably constituted up until a few years ago, almost 40 percent share of the claims we were looking, at but they are not at this point – but they are still remaining very high compared to other claims.”
