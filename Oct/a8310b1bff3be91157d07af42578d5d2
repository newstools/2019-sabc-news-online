Parliament says it will make South African Airways (SAA)’s non-submission of its audited financial statement its priority. The airliner has failed to submit its financial statements to Parliament for two consecutive financial years. In the previous financial year, the company’s audit was not finalised while in the current year under review the submission has not been made. The office of the Auditor-General says there are 49 outstanding audits including that of SAA. Standing Committee on Public Accounts Chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa says they will call SAA to explain their non-compliance. “The SAA issue of non-submission is fast becoming normalised if we do not drill into it. It speaks to the competence, effectiveness and efficiency of those in leadership and management. It cannot be allowed to continue, because if we do that we are aiding that kind of non-compliance.”
