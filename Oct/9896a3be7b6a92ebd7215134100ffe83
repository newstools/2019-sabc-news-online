The Democratic Alliance (DA) KwaZulu-Natal leader, Zwakele Mncwango, says he is considering throwing his hat into the ring for the position of party leader. This follows the resignations of Mmusi Maimane as DA leader and Athol Trollip as Federal Chairperson this week. Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, was also among those who resigned from the DA. The DA’s Federal Council Chairperson, Helen Zille, says she is not interested in becoming the party’s leader. An interim leader will be elected on  November 17. “There are people in the DA who have asked me to consider standing for the position, but I haven’t yet made up my mind. I do believe that the DA will nominate someone and that person will be elected and they have so many leaders who are capable of taking the DA forward. I haven’t yet made up my mind, but there are members who are persuading me to stand,” explains Mncwango.
