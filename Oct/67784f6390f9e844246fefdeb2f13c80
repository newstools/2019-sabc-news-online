The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has accused the University of Johannesburg (UJ) of outsourcing services while its workers are on strike. The university employees, including security personnel, support staff and cleaners have been on an indefinite strike for over two weeks now. They are demanding salary increases and medical aid among others. Workers are expected to picket at UJ’s Auckland park campus Friday morning. They will also hand over a memorandum of demands to university management. NUMSA’s Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says the university has hired external companies to replace services that their members have withdrawn during the course of the strike, instead of using the money to resolve problem at hand. “They have taken this money and spent it on services from private companies and this is something that we again condemn,” says Hlubi-Majola.
