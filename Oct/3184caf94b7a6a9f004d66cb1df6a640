Climate change activists Extinction Rebellion projected a speech by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg onto the side of the Houses of Parliament on Sunday. The activists are calling on the government to take immediate action to avert the worst devastation outlined by scientists studying the climate, engaging in two weeks of civil disobedience in cities worldwide. “It’s been sixth months since parliament declared an emergency and since then the government has done nothing. Extinction Rebellion are back to basically demand that if it’s an emergency, the government and departments produce a plan,” Extinction Rebellion member Ronald Harrington said. This comes a day before Queen Elizabeth is due to deliver a ceremonial speech from the House of Lords debating chamber on Monday.
