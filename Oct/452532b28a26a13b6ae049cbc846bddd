Three 17-year-old learners are expected to appear in the Postmansburg Magistrate’s Court in the Northern Cape following the killing of a fellow learner who was allegedly attacked at Blinkklip Secondary School. The trio allegedly stoned 17 year-old Itumeleng Witbooi on Tuesday after a fight broke out at the school. Witbooi succumbed to injuries and died in hospital on Wednesday morning. Provincial Police Commissioner, Risimati Shivuri, has confirmed the incident. “The boys were involved in the fight and they decided to use the stone to hit another and as the result, that child went to the hospital and then passed on. Those children are all of the same age. They are all 17 year-olds. As to what has caused the problem one cannot go deep enough,” says Shivuri. Meanwhile, another learner has died in the fourth attack this week after fights broke out at schools nationwide in separate incidents. Two fatal stabbing incidents in Johannesburg and Cape Town respectively, have been reported in the past week. On Wednesday morning, a 15-year-old learner was arrested for allegedly stabbing and wounding another learner at a high school in Reunion, south of Durban.
