Former President Jacob Zuma will resume his testimony at the State Capture Inquiry on the 11th of November and won’t appear next Monday as scheduled. He was expected to resume his testimony before the commission next Monday after dropping several bombshells during his first appearance in July. Commission Chairperson Raymond Zondo says Zuma is unable to attend the hearings next week due to his corruption case in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg. “The hearing of his evidence next week has been postponed but he is still going to appear before the commission from the 11th of November to the 15th. He has agreed to appear before the commission in that week; so that week stands. I will determine other dates when he will appear before the commission other than the dates of 11 to 15 November.” Earlier this week, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed Zuma’s application to strike off the roll his corruption trial linked to the multi-billion rand arms deal. Zuma has announced his intention to appeal that judgement.
