Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, will form part of the Pan-African Parliament delegation that will attend a Non-Aligned Movement meeting in Azerbaijan. The two-day meeting starts on Friday in the east European country. Malema will participate in discussions that include trade and political dynamics around the globe. “Often is the case for international bodies that as much as possible from a diplomatic point of view, it serves us well to speak in one voice, particularly as Africans. So in this case, the President constituted a delegation on behalf of PAP and that it should be easy taking into consideration a whole range of issues that are common to the continent. It should be easy to speak in one voice,” says Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.
