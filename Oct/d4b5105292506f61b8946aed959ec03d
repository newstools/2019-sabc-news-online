Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has called on police to urgently hunt down those who broke into Esithebeni Primary School in Soweto on Friday. Lesufi visited the school on Saturday accompanied by police and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko. Property worth over R3 million was stolen. Lesufi says the thieves used high-calibre machinery to steal computers and learners’ smart boards. “They broke the wall and  went in, used some of the machinery to also open the store room. So, it is quite clear that even if we have security outside the school you can’t stop nine people who are armed with AK 47s wearing balaclavas. No amount of security can stop these kinds of people. These people are nothing but dogs of war and that is why we are calling the community and law enforcement agencies to come to our rescue.”
