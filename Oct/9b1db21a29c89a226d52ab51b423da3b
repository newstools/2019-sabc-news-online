Lectures have been suspended at the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Westville campus on Monday. The university has planned a prayer session for 24-year-old student Simukelo Zondi who was burned on the property. Zondi’s burnt body was discovered in the bushes at the University over the weekend. It’s alleged that he was killed before being set alight allegedly by his close friend and roommate. Police say Zondi was reported missing last Thursday by his girlfriend. The university management hopes to meet with the Zondi family and all relevant stakeholders. Group interventions have also been planned by the university’s counselling department. –Reporting by Nonhlakanipho Magwaza and Mlungisi Khumalo
