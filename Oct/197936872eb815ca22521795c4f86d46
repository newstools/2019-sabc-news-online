Botswana Democratic Party leader, and the country’s President-elect, Dr Mokgweetsi Masisi, says his government will prioritise service delivery, economic transformation and improvement of Botswana’s education system in his next five-year term. Addressing a post-election media conference in Gaborone on Saturday, Masisi highlighted that the Botswana Democratic Party has been given an overwhelming mandate by the Batswana electorate.  The party obtained 38 of the 57 parliamentary seats up for grabs while the opposition managed only 19 seats. The elections also dealt a blow to leaders of the opposition, all whom were rejected by the electorate in their respective constituencies. Addressing a post-election media conference, Masisi thanked his supporters and the electorate for the party’s victory.  He also expressed satisfaction at how the polls were conducted.  “I think all parties really tried their best to go out and talk to people and it was done very transparently and without rancour or incident.” Masisi’s next administration will prioritise most of its promises to Batswana with a particular focus on improving their conditions of living.   ”They can expect enhanced delivery of services and see a structural alteration to our economy,” expressed Masisi. Masisi also plans to introduce a new minimum threshold for eligible public representatives.  The country’s education system is also up for an overhaul to make the country globally competitive. “We have a plan in place. It is called the ETSSP, for a lack of a better expression, which is essentially is a plan to systematically improve our education system.” President-elect Masisi is expected to be inaugurated by the country’s Chief Justice in November 1, 2019 at the University of Botswana’s sports centre.
