Former Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has just resigned from the party and Parliament.  The DA Federal Executive is meanwhile meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of an interim leader after Maimane resigned om Wednesday. Athol Trollip also resigned as Federal Chairperson of the party. The Executive will also discuss plans to seek legal advice on the way forward. DA Spokesperson Solly Malatsi says the resignations caught them by surprise. “This morning, the party central executive will convene again in order to discuss the legal advice that we had sought as of yesterday with regards to what happens in terms of process for an interim leader. Because the way our constitution is currently designed, it makes no provision whatsoever,” says Malatsi.
