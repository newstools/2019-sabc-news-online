More details have emerged on the raiding of former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede’s house. The Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks are at Gumede’s the upmarket house in Somerset Park, Umhlanga, north of Durban which they have found vacant. The African National Congress (ANC) recalled Gumede in August over her performance as mayor. The party had earlier placed her on a leave of absence following her arrest on corruption charges related to a more than R200 million waste management tender. Gumede is out on bail and the case is due to resume in the High Court in Durban in January next year. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Natasha Ramkissoon-Kara, says they will confiscate movable assets of Gumede and her co-accused. “According to the order, what will happen is that the assets will be put under curatorship, depending the outcome of the criminal trial. Various luxury houses in the areas of Zimbali and Umhlanga etc, as well as luxury vehicles, lambourghinis, jaguars, porches… those vehicles are currently being seized by my colleagues.” Gumede was recalled with former Msunduzi mayor, Themba Njilo and other members of the executive in the two municipalities. The African National Comngress’ (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) said its decision to recall the office bearers was based on an assessment of the performance of the municipalities.
