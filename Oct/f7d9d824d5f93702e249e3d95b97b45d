Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has appealed to the media to check their facts before reporting on issues relating to the State Capture Commission. Zondo was addressing an article by Business Day about former President Jacob Zuma being given a preview of questions to be asked in his next appearance before the commission. Judge Zondo says the 11 page document that has been sent to Zuma contained areas of interest and that it will be made public. He says: “I thought its important that I set the record straight, because I don’t know why on the basis of the document it is said that we sent questions to Mr Zuma, when the mere reading of that document will show that really there are no questions.” “I will cause that document to released to the public either on Tuesday or Wednesday.” says Zondo Judge Zondo made the statement at the commission hearings underway in Parktown, Johannesburg where former President Zuma’s son Duduzani Zuma is appeared for the second day on Tuesday. Zuma was responding to allegations that were leveled against him by several witnesses at the commission.
