Thousands of Iraqis continued their protests in Baghdad on Sunday (October 27), defying a bloody crackdown that killed scores over the weekend and an overnight raid by security forces seeking to disperse them. Young men had erected barricades on a bridge leading to the capital’s fortified Green Zone against security forces who continued to lob tear gas canisters towards them. Medical and security sources said 42 people had been injured. At least 69 Iraqis were killed on Friday and Saturday (October 25 and 26) and hundreds wounded as demonstrators clashed with security forces and militia groups in a second wave of this month’s protests against Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi’s government. About 226 people have been killed in October.
