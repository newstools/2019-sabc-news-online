Western Cape Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, has intervened to stop a motion of no-confidence against Deputy Chairperson of the DA caucus in the City of Cape Town, JP Smith. The DA caucus discussed the issue behind closed doors after two DA councillors, Courtney Van Wyk and Steven Vuba accused Smith of dividing the caucus. Madikizela says there are other ways of addressing concerns. “As the leadership we managed to convince the people who tabled the motion. Members of the DA have every right to raise any issues they might have. The motion of no-confidence is one way of saying we have lost confidence in that particular leader but we believe as leadership, there are different ways of dealing with those concerns,” says Madikizela.
