The Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has called on political parties such as the Freedom Front Plus  (FF Plus)to join them in their fight against all forms of racism. This after the Freedom Front Plus accused the SAHRC of having double standards in their handling of hate speech allegations against Springbok player Eben Etzebeth. Etzebeth is accused of assaulting two men in an alleged racial incident at Langebaan in the Western Cape in August. The FF Plus has raised questions over the apparent urgency in which the SAHRC is handling the allegations. However, SAHRC legal head Buang Jones says they are consistent in the way they handle allegations of racism. “I don’t understand where this comes from. We have been consistent. The concern of the FF Plus should be why is racism the most reported complaint to the SAHRC? And this has been the case for the last five years. It should concern them and they should be offering solutions on how we can deal with the scourge of racism in the country. We’ve seen an increase in the number of race related cases in the country and we want parties like the FF Plus to join us. There is a need for a Slaan Terug against racism,” says Jones.
