The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called for the Eskom’s current board and senior managers to resign. The labour federation says that the country is losing large amounts of money it does not have due to the national power utility’s incompetence. Eskom took South Africans by surprise on Wednesday when it announced stage two load shedding for the next week. Cosatu spokesperson, Sizwe Pamla says the actions of Eskom compromise President Ramaphosa. “We don’t have the money, the bailouts, the exorbitant tariffs and they are mismanaging that. They cannot account for something like R1.5 billion, at this time when the economy is on its knees. “South Africans cannot afford this, the economy cannot afford this and we just don’t have the luxury to act as if this situation is normal. We cannot normalise this because it is incompetence and mediocrity so this board needs to go and President Cyril Ramaphosa his reputation is at stake here and his entire cabinet because they were supposed to come and fix all this mess.”
