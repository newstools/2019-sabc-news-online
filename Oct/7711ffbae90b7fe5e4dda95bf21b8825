Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says heâ€™s going nowhere and will remain party leader until he is removed by a conference. He was reacting to reports that a delegation led by former DA leader, Tony Leon, met with him to ask that he quits as a leader in the interest of the party. Maimane says only a conference made up of delegates can remove him and not individuals. He was speaking at Komani in the Enoch Mgijima municipality in the Eastern Cape where he visited the Louis Rex primary school at New Rest and workers of a bottling company at Ezibeleni.
