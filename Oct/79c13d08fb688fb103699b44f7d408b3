Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola has welcomed what he describes as a ‘collaborative effort’ in the fight against corruption. This is in reaction to the decision by the United States Treasury Department to impose sanctions on three members of the Gupta family, as well as their associate Salim Essa. The Department says these individuals were part of a ‘significant corruption network in South Africa that leveraged over payments on government contracts, bribery and other corrupt acts to fund political contributions and influence government actions. “Mr Ronald Lamola has welcomed the collaborative action taken by the United States of America to ensure that the South African interests of justice unfold without any hindrance. Sanctions have a direct impact on the financial and private interests of affected individuals. The interests of justice must not be shackled by any boundary or border and justice must be seen to be done without fear or favour,” says Justice and Correctional Services Ministry Chrispin Phiri.
