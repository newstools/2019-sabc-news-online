The cross-examination of the former COO of BOSASA Angelo Agrizzi and head of Central Business Frans Vorster  has been postponed to an unspecified date at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Former ARMSCOR CEO Kevin Wakeford was expected to cross-examine the two earlier on Wednesday. During his previous testimony, Agrizzi alleged that Wakeford was paid R100 000 a month for helping the company to resolve its SARS issues. The postponement comes after the commission said it did not have certain documentation relating to BOSASA due to a dispute on the curators responsible for the company’s liquidation. Commission Chairperson Deputy Judge President Raymond Zondo said, “I am going to postpone the cross examination of Mr Aggrizzi and Mr Foster by counsel for Mr Wakeford. I am not going to fix any date because it still needs to be worked out but attempts will be made to fix a date as soon as possible and I have no doubt that the investigations that must carried out to facilitate that cross examination is going to be done as soon as possible,” says Zondo.
