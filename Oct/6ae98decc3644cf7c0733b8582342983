Student activist Mcebo Dlamini has lambasted the state saying all charges against the #FeesMustFall activists are fabricated. Dlamini faces a range of charges in connection with the violent Fees Must Fall protests that began in 2015. The student at Wits University was arrested in 2016 and charged with violating a court order, public violence, theft and malicious damage to property during Fees Must Fall protests. He was also accused of assaulting a police officer. On Tuesday, the case of the only Fees Must Fall activist still behind bars, Kanya Cekeshe was heard at the High Court in Johannesburg. Dlamini says he is disappointed that Cekeshe who was arrested in December 2017 is until now still detained at the Leeuwkop prison. He says: “We have been saying that the state doesn’t have any case against any fees must fall activists. These people are wasting the tax payers’ money and are wasting the court’s time. There are gross irregularities, unfair processes and unfair procedures in as much as he pleaded guilty.” “There was a call for free education and students demanded attention from government. The fight for free education was for a noble cause which means you nullify all the violence,” adds Dlamini. Watch related video below:
