The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has fined Judge Nkola Motata over R1 million for misconduct. Motata was found guilty of drunk driving in 2009 after crashing his car against a wall in a Hurlingham residence in Sandton, north of Johannesburg in 2007. The crash was followed by a racist rant that was recorded on a cellphone. Following a protracted process where the Judicial Conduct Tribunal found Motata guilty of gross misconduct and recommending impeachment, the JSC has now made a final verdict of misconduct.
