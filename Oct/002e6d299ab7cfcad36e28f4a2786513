Duduzane Zuma will on Monday appear at the State Capture Commission. Zuma was first mentioned at the Commission by Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas as the person who took him to the Gupta Saxonwold home in October 2015. Jonas testified he was offered R600 000 in cash and a further R600 million to accept the job of Finance Minister then held by Nhlanhla Nene. This would have enabled the Guptas to get their hands on the purse strings of Treasury. Zumaâ€™s lawyers subsequently cross-examined Jonas but it will be the first time Zuma will present his version of events to the Inquiry.
