The Civil Aviation Authority’s Poppy Khoza says media reports were the main reason for the CAA to conduct inspections on airline fleets.  Several aircraft were grounded by the CAA, which caused flight delays across the country.  The CAA discovered inconsistencies during its audit of SAA Technical, which conducts maintenance for a number of local carriers – including Comair, SAA and Mango. Khoza says, “There was a number of reports that we were following on the media. When we did our audit, we found that there’re safety deficiencies, they relate to, one the release of aircraft to service was not done by proper and qualified personals. The second reason was in relation to the issue maintenance, what we call flight data recorder.” Click on the video below:
