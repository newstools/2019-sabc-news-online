The delinquency trial of former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni has been postponed in the Pretoria High Court to November. Myeni’s legal representative, Nqabayethu Buthelezi earlier asked the court for more time to make amendments to Myeni’s plea. Judge Ronel Tolmay announced the postponement after consulting with counsel and legal representatives on a way forward. Tolmay says the court cannot go ahead with proceedings until all the pleas are finalised. Myeni has failed to show up in court on two occasions this month, claiming poverty. She says she could not afford a lawyer because she was unemployed. Judge Tolmay says although she is not happy with the delays, the court has a responsibility to oversee a fair trial. The case was brought against her by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and the SAA Pilots Association. According to OUTA, SAA incurred losses of up to R16 billion between 2012 and 2017 – while Myeni was at helm of the airline.
