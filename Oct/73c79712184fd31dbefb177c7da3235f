Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has shortlisted eight candidates to be interviewed for the position of deputy public protector. The names were selected from a list of 19 who met the criteria stipulated on the application form. The EFF has objected to one name on the shortlist but is unable to persuade the ANC to withdraw the candidate. Those who made the shortlist are Moshoeshoe Toba, Sonwabile Mancotywa, Shadrack Nkuna, Noxolo Mbangeni, Lwazi Kubukeli, Puleng Matshelo, Buang Jones and Kholeka Gcaleka. EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi raised concerns about Gcaleka, pointing out her flagging by the organisation Corruption Watch. It points out that in 2010 Gcaleka was quoted as saying there should be no concern about then NPA head Menzi Simelane’s plan to close the specialised commercial crimes unit and asset forfeiture unit. Ndlozi said her role as advisor to former Finance Malusi Gigaba was also problematic. In the end, the committee resolved to go with the eight names, adding that objections will be dealt with during the interviews and the vetting process. The interviews will be held on November 12 and 13. Click on the video below:
