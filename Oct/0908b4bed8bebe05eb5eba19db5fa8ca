As South Africa joins other countries in celebrating World Teachers’ Day, the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has expressed deep concern about the high number of sexual misconduct cases reported at the country’s schools. A report into misconduct among teachers at schools across the country has revealed that the South African Council of Educators is looking into 633 misconduct cases across the country with the highest being in KwaZulu-Natal followed by Gauteng. “The ACDP is extremely concerned by the reports that we continue to receive of the number of school teachers who are having sexual relationships or relationships that are untoward with learners in schools. Certainly, this particular behaviour is unbecoming of teachers in the profession. It is an insult to the profession,” says the ACDP’s Wayne Thring. Meanwhile, Head of Spark Schools Bailey Thomson-Blake says a shortage of qualified and trained teachers is at the heart of the crisis in South Africa’s education system. Saturday, is World Teachers’ Day. To celebrate the day world bodies Unesco and Education International are seeking to give the world a better understanding of the role of teachers. “I think really effective teacher training focuses on classroom culture above all and specifically working on core values in social and emotional development as the foundation and then adding the content expertise,” says Thomson-Blake. “Our schools are aligned CAPS, which is the national curriculum but there needs to be a focus on critical thinking and collaboration and other skills that students will need to be successful in the future whether it’s going to university or doing a career that fulfils them.”
