A security expert says it’s nearly impossible to keep up with hackers. Interpol ambassador, Andy Mashaile was speaking in the wake of an attack on the City of Johannesburg’s online system. “Every seven days, criminals, including hackers, devise a new modus operandi and the interesting element is, with hackers, there is zero cost to physical harm, not being shot and that kind of stuff. They would spend a lot of time employing those who are unemployed, the graduates out there to give them advice.” Watch full interview below:  At the same time, the banking industry is also dealing with a wave of cyber threats to interrupt its systems.
The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) says in some cases, Bitcoin has been demanded to avert cyber attacks. The big four banks are affected and customers are apparently experiencing delays. SABRIC says if the attacks persist and the banks cannot withstand them, there will be interruptions, and clients may have problems accessing their apps or online banking. Meanwhile, the City of Joburg says it hopes to have online services up-and-running again by this weekend after a hackers group sent demands to individual staff at the city.
