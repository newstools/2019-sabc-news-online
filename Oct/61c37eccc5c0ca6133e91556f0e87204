The National Council of Provinces’ (NCOP) Select Committee on Security and Justice says the Border Management Authority Bill will soon be passed into law. The Bill aims to regulate border management. The Bill is now with the NCOP after passing through the National Assembly. The committee has conducted its oversight at one of the busiest port of entries, Beitbridge, near Musina in Limpopo. The committee chairperson, Shahidabibi Shaikh, says they wanted to see the situation at the border post. “The reason we’re here is try to look at some of the challenges in terms of managing the borders. One of the other issues that we’re busy with as a committee or we will be processing as a committee is the Border Management Authority Bill. Our intention of coming here is to get a view of what’s happening at the border, how things are being managed, controlled and coordinated,” says Shaikh. Watch a related video below:
