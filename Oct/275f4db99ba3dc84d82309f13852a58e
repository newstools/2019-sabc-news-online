The Information Regulator was granted leave to intervene as a friend of the court in the case of the President versus Public Protector. Privacy and data protection concerns have been triggered by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s reliance on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s private emails and bank statements of various entities used by his CR17 presidential campaign team. These records were used by Mkhwebane to support her report, which found that Ramaphosa had misled Parliament by failing to declare the donations made to his CR17 presidential campaign. The Regulator has been quite active in engaging parties and making public statements relating to other matters that affect the protection of personal information. Member of the Information Regulator, Sizwe Snail Ka Mtuze says, “Because of the constitutional implication of personal information having been possibly unlawfully obtained, the Information Regulator felt that it was important that we get involved in this litigation as a friend of the court. In other words, we’re not of the litigation party, but we’re simply there as a friend of the court to advise on serious complex legal matters so that we can assist in the development of the jurisprudence which we will have to uphold at a later stage.” Click on the video below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/753260">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
