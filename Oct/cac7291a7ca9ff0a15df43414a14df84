Eskom says despite a constrained power system, no loadshedding is expected for Monday. It says the probability of load shedding is low for the rest of the week. In a statement, the power utility says the system’s improvement is largely the result of several units being returned to service from planned and unplanned maintenance and achieving a healthy water level at its pumped storage schemes. Last week, the power utility implemented Stage Two load shedding unexpectedly despite assuring the public on Thursday that there won’t be power cuts over the weekend, Stage two and one load shedding were imposed on Friday and Saturday.
