Beleaguered Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane is adamant that he will remain party leader despite internal political pressure. Maimane says the responsibility or power to remove him is not vested on individuals. He was conducting a political site visit in the troubled Komani based Enoch Mgijima in the Eastern Cape. The DA leader, who could potentially be walking through the valley of the shadow of death of his political career, says he fears no evil or being ousted from his position as leader.  This is despite being under pressure following claims that he’s living in a house owned by a Durban businessman and also driving a car donated by controversial former Steinhoff CEO, Markus Joste. Maimane was however cleared through internal party processes.   But the pressure is not off his shoulders just yet.  There are reports that former party leader Tony Leon and Ryan Coetzee met with him suggesting he should step down. Speaking to SABC News, Maimane maintains he has a mandate from the party which will not be derailed. The internal squabbles are leading to a trust deficit. Meanwhile, the DA’s Presiding Officer of Federal Council Elections Desiree Van Der Walt says former DA leader and premier of the Western Cape Helen Zille is eligible to run for the DA’s Federal Council Chairperson. Van Der Walt was responding to newspaper reports which cast doubt on Zille’s eligibility claiming that she is competing against Athol Trollip, Mike Waters and Thomas Walters for the crucial position which was occupied by the party’s James Selfe. Zille says she willing to work with any leader of the DA should she be elected to the position.
