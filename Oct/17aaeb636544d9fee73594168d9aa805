Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane has denied as false her outgoing deputy Kevin Malunga’s allegations that he was side-lined from handling high-profile cases. In an interview with the SABC, Malunga also raised concern over a number of cases the office of the Public Protector has lost in the past few months. Mkhewbane says there is no evidence suggesting that some high-profile cases were investigated in secrecy. She was speaking after addressing students at the Tshwane University of Technology at the Soshanguve south campus, north of Pretoria on Friday. Mkhwebane says, “In this environment of security of the country, you are dealing with the security of the people, the infrastructure, you are dealing with security of documents, you are dealing with security of information, you are dealing with security of your systems. So the kind of work which has been delegated to the DPP, he did that and any other investigator who did the work, so there is nothing which is done in secret.” The Public Protector has also accused some investigating officials of being part of a plot to sabotage her as an individual, especially in matters which she lost court cases. Mkhwebane says these investigators are seeking to spread negative information about her, and fuelling perceptions that she’s incompetent. She has cited a Constitutional Court judgment in which she was ordered to pay a portion of the legal costs from her own pocket, as one of the cases in which she was sabotaged.
