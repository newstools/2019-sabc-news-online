Four of South African Airways’ (SAA) domestic flights have been cancelled after some of its aircraft were recalled after inspection. The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) took a decision to ground the air crafts following an oversight inspection conducted by the SACAA at SAA’s maintenance subsidiary – South African Airways Technical. The aviation authority could not be reached for comment. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali says some of its flights will operate later than usual, “South African Airways would like to advise its customers and passengers that it may operate an amended flights schedule today following a decision to recall some of its aircraft in order to undertake a compliance verification exercise in line with SA Civil Aviation requirements. However, SAA has implemented contingency plans in order to ensure it minimizes the impact on its customers and to ensure business continuity.” Meanwhile, both Kulula and British Airways planes have reportedly also been grounded. Passengers will experience inevitable delays as affected air crafts may not be flown until the necessary corrective action has been carried out. The Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) is also yet to comment on whether this has had any impact on the operations at various airports.
