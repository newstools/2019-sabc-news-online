White House senior adviser Jared Kushner held a meeting with Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz on Monday in Jerusalem. Kushner has been leading U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to develop a peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians. After proposing a $60 billion aid package for the region last summer, he has yet to unveil a proposed political plan that gets at the thorniest issues in the decades-old conflict, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struggling to form a governing coalition. An embassy announcement said Kushner, who was accompanied by his two main deputies Avi Berkowitz and Brian Hook discussed with Gantz and his co-leader of Blue and White party Yair Lapid “the strong relationship and unbreakable alliance between the United States and Israel, and the ongoing developments in the Middle East”. Later in the day, Kushner also held a meeting with Netanyahu.
