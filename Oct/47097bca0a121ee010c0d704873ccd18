Political analyst Piet Croucamp says former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane faces little to no prospect of success if he endeavors to form a new party before local government elections in 2021. Following his resignation from the DA this week, speculation is rife that Maimane might form a new party. Maimane left the DA, citing that the party is not suited to take forward his vision of building a ‘One South Africa for all’. Croucamp says in the run-up to the local government elections and given the oppressive past of the country, Maimane will have a hard time convincing the majority of the electorate of his social-democratic values. “He tried to move the party to a social democratic party which I think is more likely to appeal to black voters and the black middle class. So with the elections I think the biggest problem that the DA has is to try to get black voters back? There’s no history in South Africa of being successful if you break away from one of the two bigger parties. Maybe he will do it but I can’t see him being successful with that, especially if he tries to be liberal.”
