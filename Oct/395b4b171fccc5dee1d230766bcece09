In his weekly newsletter titled “From the Desk of the President”, President Cyril Ramaphosa has focused on the economy and initiatives government is taking to improve the country’s competitiveness.  The President is in London where he will on Monday address the Financial Times Africa Summit 2019, an event which he says provides an opportunity for South Africa to talk to investors about the country and Africa’s business potential. According to the President, this is aimed at creating jobs and reducing the cost of living. While he lauds the improvement in South Africa’s competitiveness ranking as reflected in the World Economic Forum report released last week, he says more must still be done. He says government has a bold vision to be a destination of choice for foreign direct investment and this requires far-reaching reforms. These include reducing the cost of doing business for both large and small businesses, improving the quality of South Africa’s institutions, enhancing administrative efficiency and governance systems.
