The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Wednesday hear evidence from former Free State Finance MEC, Elzabe Rockman, in relation to the controversial Estina dairy farm project in Vrede. Rockman is expected to testify in Parktown, Johannesburg, about the department’s role in the funding of the failed project. Over R200 million in public funds were channeled to the Estina dairy farm project. Rockman is expected to give clarity on oversight the finance department exercised in releasing the funds. The project was led by a Gupta linked company, Estina. The provincial government promoted it as a tool that would benefit black emerging farmers. Two weeks ago, the commission heard how more than R200 million was paid to the Gupta-linked Estina’s account between 2012 and 2016 two years after the project was cancelled. Rockman was MEC from 2013 until May this year when the new Premier, Sisi Ntombela took over. Related Video below
