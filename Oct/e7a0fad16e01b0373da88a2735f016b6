Johannesburg residents are being called upon to use water sparingly as the levels of the Vaal Dam have fallen to below 50% on Monday â€“ the lowest level recorded in three years. The City of Johannesburg attributes the drop in water level to the heat wave of the past few days coupled with the lack of rain in Gauteng. The city issued a similar warning two weeks ago, when the dam level was at 55%. This time last year, the Vaal Dam level was 86%.
