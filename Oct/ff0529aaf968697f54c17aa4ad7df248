The Basic Education Department is considering rescheduling the Grade 12 technology exam which could not be written in many parts of the country due to power cuts. Many centres across the country were affected by Eskom’s load shedding with many learners not been able to write or complete the exam. Grade 12 learners sat for their first exam paper on Wednesday, which was Computer Applications Technology. Provinces affected include Gauteng, Limpopo, Kwazulu-Natal, Northern Cape and Western Cape. In Gauteng about 10 centres could not successfully proceed with the examinations. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona says three centres could not save the work that was done by the learners and seven centres could not write at all. “We have about 26 centres where learners were able to write. The Department of Basic Education will have to consider the concessions and those learners will be allowed to write what we call a re-write.” “The department will have to schedule a new paper because that one its in the public space and learners have accessed it so they will then have to write a new paper. It is quite unfortunate that we were severely affected.” The Basic Education Department’s spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says they are very concerned about the ongoing power cuts. “The power cuts are disturbing the administration of our examinations especially on Wednesday and Thursday when practical subjects that need electricity are being written.” “We are now being forced to schedule another day for these examinations. We will finalise and make an announcement on that.” Related video below
