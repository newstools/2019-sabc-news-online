UK-based group, the South African Constitution, Independence, Security and Accountability (SACISA), has come out in support of the Democratic Alliance ‘s (DA) call for a probe into allegations that the Vice-Chancellor of Stellenbosch University, Professor Wim de Villiers, attempted to improperly influence the appointment of the Chancellor at the institution. The DA is alleging that De Villiers approached former Constitutional Court Justice, Edwin Cameron, while he was involved in hearing an appeal by organisation Gelyke Kanse, regarding the university’s language policy. The Constitutional Court ruled that the university’s language policy, which elevates English above Afrikaans as a medium of instruction is constitutionally justified. “Our concern is that the inquiry should have been dealt with before the judgement was made in the Gelyke Kanse decision about the continuation of Afrikaans language at the university of Stellenbosch, and particularly thereafter that Justice Cameron was appointed chancellor because Justice Cameron and the Chief Justice were involved with the Concourt ruling on October 10, and our concern is there might well be a strong argument that there was a conflict of interest,”says SACISA spokesperson, Justine Lewis. De Villiers earlier said that he was not involved in the process of electing the new chancellor. He says the only correspondence he had with Justice Cameron was regarding his availability for the role which he declined. De Villiers says he is positive that he acted in good faith and that the election process was ultimately ran in accordance with the university’s policies.
