The Pietermaritzburg High Court is due to hand down its ruling on Friday in the application by former president Jacob Zuma and French arms company – Thales. The two applied for a permanent stay of prosecution in the corruption case. The charges date back to 2005 and both Zuma and Thales blame the state for unfair delays in the prosecution process. Zuma also argued that the decision to charge him was politically motivated. During closing arguments both the legal teams of the applicants and the state blamed each other for the delays. During the last court appearance, Zuma’s legal team also submitted new evidence in the application at the last minute. This being a letter which, according to Zuma’s legal team, supports their argument of political meddling in the decision to charge Zuma. Watch related video:
