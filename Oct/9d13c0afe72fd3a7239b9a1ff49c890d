Saturday marks World Teachers’ Day.  To celebrate the day, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and a global union federation of teachers’ trade unions, Education International, are giving the world a better understanding of their role. South Africa has more than 400 000 teachers who fulfil a crucial developmental role. Despite some challenges, teaching remains a calling to many.  “I’m still young. They believe we are of the same age. It is difficult to discipline them,” say one of the teachers. Another teacher says, “I thought to myself why not try to make a change in an African child’s life and the way they do things.”
