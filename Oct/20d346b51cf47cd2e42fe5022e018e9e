Opposition parties in the Metsimaholo Municipality have accused the Free State government of using underhand tactics to collapse the governance structure and eventually dissolve the council. Several council meetings had to be stopped due to disagreements between the opposition and the five-party coalition partners over the appointment of senior managers. Key senior management positions remain vacant despite the municipality having spent more than R500 000 on recruitment. Democratic Alliance (DA) caucus leader in Metsimaholo, Thabiso Mofokeng, says there are concerted by the efforts to collapse the municipality. “I think the Speaker must comply and do things that are there to guide us if the law is being followed then I think a lot of our problems would be solved. But the Speaker’s doing things his own way. I don’t know how he interprets or which laws is he interpreting, but it’s not the same as us. And so we will be pin on him to say that ‘you know what you must follow the law that’s it and not party resolutions just because they’re the majority party in council.’ If he follows the law then we won’t have any problems.”
