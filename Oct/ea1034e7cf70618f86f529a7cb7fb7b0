President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to engage motorists at a roadblock on the N3 Highway at Heidelberg Weighbridge in Gauteng on Saturday morning. The engagement is part of the launch of Transport Month where a revamped Arrive Alive programme will be unveiled. The President will also proclaim the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (AARTO) Act that he signed into law on August 13, 2019, aimed at improving road user behaviour for the country. Metro traffic and law enforcement officers, players from the transport industry, motorcycling associations and relatives of people who have lost their lives in road crashes have gathered for the launch of the Transport Month campaign. Besides the President interacting with motorists, guests will also be accommodated in a large marquee to hear what steps will be taken to prevent the carnage that occurs daily on South Africaâ€™s roads. Ramaphosa will be joined by Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. Watch related video below:
