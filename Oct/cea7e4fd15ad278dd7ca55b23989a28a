President Cyril Ramaphosa has handed over 230 houses to beneficiaries in Bloemfontein as part of the Breaking New Ground project. The mixed development project includes houses for the bonded market. The handing over of the houses was part of the Hillside View Integrated Human settlements project, which Ramaphosa launched in Bloemfontein. The project was initiated in 2016, as part of the governments commitment to providing decent accommodation to members of the Manguang community. Beneficiaries of the multibillion-rand housing project in Bloemfontein say their dignity has been restored. President Cyril Ramaphosa has officially launched the project.  Those who received houses included  99-year-old Matokelo Taole who has been living in a shack. The housing project is expected to be completed in 2022. The President has also expressed concern about the state of municipalities. Several Free State municipalities are on the brink of financial collapse.  They are unable to settle their debts and generate revenue.
