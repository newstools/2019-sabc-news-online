Minister of Police Bheki Cele has led an awareness march through the streets of Pretoria to highlight gender-based violence. Cele was joined by scores of police officers in full uniform and others in plain clothes. Cele also interacted with members of the public during the march. The march ended at the Sunnyside Police Station. The area is known for drug peddling by foreign nationals. The minister and members of the police management team were taken on a tour to show and demonstrate facilities used to assist and accommodate victims of gender-based violence.
