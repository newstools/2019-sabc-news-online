Former Head of the Free State Agriculture Department, Peter Thabethe, will on Friday morning continue with his testimony at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown, Johannesburg. Thabethe, who is now represented by Advocate Nqabayethu Buthelezi, will be giving evidence about his role in the controversial Vrede dairy farm project in the Free State. The R200 million project was supposed to help emerging farmers, but large amounts of cash allegedly ended up in the hands of the Gupta family. On Thursday, Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, challenged Thabethe’s contention that negative media reports had led to the project being halted. Meanwhile, former Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa says he has instructed his lawyers to sue for defamation after allegations against him resurfaced at the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg. Crime Intelligence Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo told the commission that a Mercedes worth R300 000 was purchased for Mthethwa from the Crime Intelligence slush fund. Naidoo also revealed to the State Capture Inquiry that security renovations were done to the private residence of Mthethwa in 2009. Mthethwa says these are old allegations and he is going to sue. “I definitely will sue for defamation and I’ve already instructed my lawyers. We are suing Mr Naidoo for R5 million for that because it’s not a new thing. It is something that everybody knows that these allegations, both of the wall and of the so called SUV came about in 2012 and at the time the DG (Director General) wanted us to investigate, which he did. He spoke to everybody and I was cleared and they know that I was cleared on all counts including the SUV.”
