Transnet will on Thursday be launching the longest production train in the world at their depot in Saldanha Bay on the Cape West Coast. Transnet says the four-kilometer long train, with 375 wagons, will also carry the highest volumes per train. The train will transport manganese over a distance of more than 860 kilometers between the Sishen mine in the Northern Cape and Saldanha Bay. Transnet says the train will go a long way in lowering the cost of doing business in the country and migrating traffic from road to rail. It is estimated that the train will add R355 million in freight revenue annually.
