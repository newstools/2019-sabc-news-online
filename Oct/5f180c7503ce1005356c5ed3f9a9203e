 At least 24 people have died on roads in the Western Cape this weekend. This follows another fatal crash last night at Elsiesrivier in Cape Town in which two vehicles were involved. Two passengers were killed and six people seriously injured. Provincial Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says two taxis were involved in the crash early on Monday morning on the N1 near Touwsrivier. One of the vehicles overturned. Africa says this latest incident takes the number of fatalities on the province’s roads this weekend to at least 25. “Early this morning (Monday) at around quarter past three, we had a taxi crash just outside Touwsriver where two taxis were involved in a collision. In one of the taxis a baby died and the 17 other occupants were taken to Worcester hospital with minor injuries.”
