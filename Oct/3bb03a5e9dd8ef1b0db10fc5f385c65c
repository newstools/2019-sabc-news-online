Johannesburg Water says roving trucks with water tanks are on standby to be sent to areas where there is no water within the city. Stage two water supply restrictions are in place amid a lack of rain, high water usage and a heat wave. Johannesburg Water has shut down some reservoirs. Stage two restrictions mean that people cannot use hosepipes when washing their cars and paved areas. Gardens can only be watered after six in the evening and before six in the morning. Swimming pools may not be filled. Johannesburg Water Spokesperson, Isaac Dhludhlu sya:”We are trying to provide assistance through roving trucks and tanks. We are appealing to those who have water to continue use water sparingly as we are approaching new heat wave that is going to come to the province.” “Going forward we are monitoring the situation and where necessary we are also trying to manipulate the system to try and make sure that we cover low lying areas in terms of provision of water.”
