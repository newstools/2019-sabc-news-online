Five people have died in two separate incidents on Cape Town roads. Four people, including three men and one woman died when a bakkie collided head-on with a car on the N-2, at Jakes Gerwel Drive, near Heideveld. Traffic spokesperson, Richard Coleman, says the driver of the bakkie was driving in the incorrect direction when the collision occurred. He says the driver, who only sustained slight injuries in the crash, was subsequently arrested by police for driving under the influence of alcohol. While in a separate incident, the driver of a tow truck, who was responding to the scene of the crash on the N-2, died after he lost control of the vehicle, causing it to roll and crash into a house in Heideveld. One other occupant was slightly injured.
