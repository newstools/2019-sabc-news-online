The pre-sentencing proceedings of convicted child rapist, Nicholas Ninow, will continue in the High Court in Pretoria on Thursday morning. The state is expected to call witnesses in aggravation of sentencing after Ninow and his grandmother, Pauline Gericke, on Wednesday testified in mitigation of sentencing. Gericke pleaded with the High Court in Pretoria to be lenient in its sentencing of her grandson. She says he was introduced to drugs by his own mother and it’s been a downward spiral from there. “There’s another side to Nicholas, there’s a good and I raised him to be a good boy but because of the first eight years of his life where he was abused and because of the drugs I do not for one minute say that Nicholas should not be punished, I do not say that he is innocent, he is guilty I know that.” Click video below:
