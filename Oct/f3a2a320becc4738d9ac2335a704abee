The family of Naledi Lethoba, whose charred body was found in a veld in May this year,  has called for a return of the death penalty. Lethoba’s boyfriend Obed Leshoro appeared briefly in the Welkom magistrate’s court in the Free State on a charge of murder. The case has been postponed to the second of December. Both the deceased and the accused were students at the Goldfields TVET College in Welkom. Lethoba’s grandfather, Molefi Nyakane says it’s high time the law is reviewed amid the continued brutal attacks on people. “According to me he should be hanged, that punishment suits everybody who has done the same problem. The death penalty must be introduced. I think it will be the one that eradicates this problem, that is the only solution. Because  it is now everyday you get the same thing has happened somewhere. Even this one of us only after two weeks we heard there’s a child in Allanridge who was also murder in the very same manner,” says Nyakane.
