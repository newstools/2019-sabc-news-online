The Democratic Alliance’s Federal Council Chairperson and acting DA leader, Helen Zille, says she is not interested in becoming the party’s leader. This follows the resignations of Mmusi Maimane as DA leader and Athol Trollip as Federal Executive Chairperson this week. Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, was also among those who resigned from the DA – citing that the election of Zille as Federal Council Chairperson stood diametrically opposed to his beliefs. She has described the resignations as an unfortunate turn of events in the history of the DA. Zille will be the acting leader until the DA’s federal council can elect an interim leader, which she says will occur on November 17. “On the 17th of November – it works very simply that every delegate to the council – about 138 when I last counted – gets together in JHB, we go through the proper process of nominated an interim chairperson and interim leader. They are elected and we have a federal congress around April next year. I am not in the least bit interested in being the leader. I was really enjoying my retirement and I was enjoying my new projects and trying to get some sane commentary into the analysis that goes down in politics in SA and then all of this happened. I didn’t seek it out or want it, but I have done it.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/762170">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
