A two-year-old toddler has been raped in Reiger Park, Boksburg on Gauteng’s East Rand. Police have arrested a 34-year-old man. Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says the man was arrested on Friday following an investigation, which began in the week when the case was opened. It is alleged the man raped the child when her mother left her in his care to go to work. Masondo says the man will appear in court on Monday. “A case was opened on Tuesday after a two-year-old child was raped. As we prioritise cases that involve children and women, we started to investigate. We have been looking for the suspect and we managed to arrest him yesterday. He is a 34-year-old man. He will be charged with rape and he will be expected to appear at Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday.”
