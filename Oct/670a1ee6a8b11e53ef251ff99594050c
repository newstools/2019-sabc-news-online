The Congress of the People (COPE) has called on the Home Affairs and Finance ministers to explain who is managing the Lindela Repatriation Centre for undocumented Foreigners. COPE spokesperson Dennis Bloem says it has come to the attention of the party that African Global Operations (AGO), formerly known as BOSASA, still has the contract to run the centre. Bloem insists that Ministers Aaron Motsoaledi and Tito Mboweni must cancel the contract because the company is milking the South African government of millions of rands every month. Several witnesses have made serious allegations against AGO at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.  Watch related video below:
