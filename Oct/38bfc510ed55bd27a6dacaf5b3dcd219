Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi has announced that teachers and learners in Gauteng will now have full access to the new online curriculum lesson system. This comes after Lesufi took to his twitter account to showcase the new system. According to Lesufi, it took the department almost six years to fulfill its promise of an online system and it is believed that it will change and enhance especially township education. The programme will include digital lessons, teacher guides, multimedia content in languages,  amongst other features. The new online curriculum lesson will help parents find assist learners with homework. Parents can sample their children’s tests or exams and the system will mark them. The department is extremely excited about this new innovation.
