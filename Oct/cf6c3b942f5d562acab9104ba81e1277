“Celebrate every step” was the theme for the 21st Big Walk for Cancer.  The annual event is held in support of those who have been touched by the disease.  Thousands of walkers gathered at the Port Elizabeth beachfront to celebrate the event. The streets of Port Elizabeth were painted pink for the big walk that aims to raise awareness around breast cancer. It is the most prevalent cancer amongst women worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation early detection of the disease remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control. Eastern Cape Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba says, “Many people think that’s cancer stage four and that is where the problem begins. We encourage people to go out and test each year.” For survivors the theme speaks volumes as life has really been about celebrating every step.  Survivor Dr Lesley Lee says, “I am a cancer survivor not once but twice. When I was 16 years old, I lost my leg through a rare kind of cancer, and in 2017 I was diagnosed with breast cancer so I am celebrating every step today.” The Cancer Association of South Africa is this year’s beneficiary. In 2018, it used funds raised by the big walk for a mobile mole finder that detects signs of skin cancer. Click video below:
