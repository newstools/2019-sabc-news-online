Workers made preparations inside the Rugby World Cup venue of International Yokohama Stadium ahead of Typhoon Hagibis’ landfall on Friday, removing banners and tying down equipment. Typhoon Hagibis, which means “speed” in the Philippine language Tagalog, is due to make landfall on the main island of Honshu on Saturday, a month after one of the strongest typhoons to hit Japan in recent years destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses and caused extensive power cuts. Rugby World Cup organisers on Thursday (October 10) cancelled Saturday’s game between England and France as well as New Zealand’s match against Italy due to the risk from the typhoon. Japanese Formula One Grand Prix organisers have also cancelled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday.
