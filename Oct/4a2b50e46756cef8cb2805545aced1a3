Incidences of housebreaking topped the list of crimes which most affected South Africans, according to the Victims of Crime 2018/2019 report which was a released by StatsSA on Thursday morning in Pretoria. “There were about 1,3 million incidences of housebreaking affecting 5,8% of households in South Africa. The most likely victims of housebreaking were male-headed households, households in metros, Indian/Asian households followed by white households, very low and very high-income households, and households in Northern Cape, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Approximately 48% of affected households reported incidences to the police,” according to StatsSA. The Statistician-General of South Africa, Mr Risenga Maluleke, briefed journalists about the report, which is extracted from the Governance, Public Safety and Justice Survey (GPSJS), that replaced the Victims of Crime Survey (VOCS) when that survey was expanded. The statistical body explained that the victim of crime report is aimed at complimenting the official crime statistics released by the police. Other serious crimes affecting households and individuals are motor vehicle theft, murder, assault, hijacking, theft of personal property and street robbery.
