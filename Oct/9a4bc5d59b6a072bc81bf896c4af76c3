The University of Venda and Microsoft South Africa are piloting a facial recognition computer system for students in an effort to improve safety on campus. Four years ago, two female students, a cleaner and two young children were raped and murdered by a student. It took a long time for police to arrest the perpetrator, Godfrey Ntsieni who is behind bars. Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Professor Jan Crofford says they hope the facial recognition system will prevent such incidents. He was speaking during a safety and security seminar being held on campus by five universities. “We have a smart security plan for our university, which entails increased surveillance of cameras; increased lighting; as well a very interesting pilot that we are doing with Microsoft South Africa, in terms of using facial recognition technology to access residence. Currently, we have one female residence where you can only enter if your face is recognised by this technology.”
