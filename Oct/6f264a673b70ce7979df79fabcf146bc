Several areas of the Western Cape remain affected by the drought despite some good rains during the winter period. The Kannaland Municipality in the Little Karoo is one of the areas still in the grips of the drought. Dam levels in the area remain critically low, while boreholes are now the main source of water for residents. Kannaland encompasses the areas of Calitzdorp, Vanwyksdorp, Zoar and Ladismith. With water restrictions in place, households are limited to 20 kilolitres per month. Kannaland Municipal Manager, Reynold Stevens says, “We have received less rain than last year, which makes it so much more difficult for our residents. But we still have water restrictions in place and the community is cooperating with regards to the restrictions, although we have a challenge with the law enforcement part, the monitoring of consumption of the residents.” Residents of the Little Karoo say water shortages in the region are affecting their quality of life. Calitsdorp resident Mequell Hess says, “We can’t use much water because we don’t have enough water in the dams. We wish it could rain here because it does not rain enough. Some Christians they go and pray at the dam to hope for more rain to come.”
