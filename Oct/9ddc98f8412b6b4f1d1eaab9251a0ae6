Learners from Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape have taken to the streets of the beachfront to create awareness about plastic pollution. The learners from more than 10 schools also took part in an educational session with tips on preventing plastic from ending up in the ocean. The event was put together by non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sustainable Seas Trust, (SST).  Sharne Woods from SST says the idea is to make young people aware of how important the sea is. “Today’s youth march is all about empowering the youth to take responsibility and ownership for their futures. Today we will also show an educational program where learners will be exposed on how they can in their personal capacity be part of the solutions to ensuring zero plastic to the east of Africa.”
