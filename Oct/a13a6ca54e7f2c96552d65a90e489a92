Five people have been killed in a crash on the N3 between Cliffdale and Cato Ridge outside Durban. The driver of a bakkie lost control of the vehicle before it veered off the highway. Traffic authorities say the passengers were flung out as it overturned. Five people died instantly and seven others were injured, four of whom were rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Traffic along the N3 was diverted while emergency services cleared the scene. Last week, five other people died in a collision on the N2 near Thornhill in the Eastern Cape. The collision involved a truck and two vehicles. The deceased included two men, two women and a four-year-old girl.
