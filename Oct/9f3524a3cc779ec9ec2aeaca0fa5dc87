The MEC for Education in Mpumalanga, Bonakele Majuba, has raised concern about the decline in the number of learners registered to write mathematics and physical science in this year’s grade 12 final examinations. Majuba says the number has declined from the 34 000 registered last year to 28 000. The MEC was speaking in Mbombela during a press conference to outline their plans for the forth coming examinations. Majuba is optimistic that the province will achieve the set target of 82% pass rate. She says her department is working hard to increase the number of learners who take Maths and Science going into matric. She says, “We are aware that the challenge we are facing is that most parents and even some learners perceive Maths and Science to be difficult subjects. As such you will find that they are being discouraged to take such subjects.”
