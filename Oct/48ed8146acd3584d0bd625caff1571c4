Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says plans are underway to implement new security measures on trains. He was speaking during the release of the Railway Safety Report in Stellenbosch that is published by the Railway Safety Regulator. At least 375 people have died on the country’s railways between April 2018 and March 2019 due to operational issues like derailments, collisions and level-crossing incidents. Mbalula says new security measures are crucial to address commuter safety. “We are going to bring a new security arrangement in the trains. These people will be trained in terms of crowd control and combat reaction. So, we must be combat-ready in terms of that. In terms of SAPS, SAPS will assist us with regard to training what we have inherited, in terms of security in the trains.”
