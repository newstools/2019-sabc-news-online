Former president Thabo Mbeki has come out in full support of former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, following his resignation from the party and Parliament earlier on Thursday. Maimane resigned from the party leadership position on Wednesday. Mbeki says he now understands that racism is deeply enshrined in the country, as it is reflected in the recent developments within the DA. Maimane’s departure was followed by that of DA Federal Chairperson, Athol Trollip. The party’s Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba had resigned on Monday. Mbeki says according to the Constitution, all registered political formations have an obligation to contribute to efforts to make South Africa a non-racial country. He says it’s worrying that some political leaders and activists are still using the race card to fulfill their selfish political gains. In a statement, Mbeki makes an appeal to the DA not to sustain colonial and apartheid social relations. He says the millions of citizens will gain nothing from any negative movement in any of the political parties towards policies based on racism. Meanwhile, the DA will in the next six weeks meet to find an interim replacement for Mmusi Maimane.
