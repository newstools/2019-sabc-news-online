Thousands of underage girls living around the Ratlou Local Municipality outside Mahikeng are pregnant or recently had babies, some of which are as young as nine years. Girls from this poverty-stricken area are not given guidance on sexual education and seem to be a target for older men with money. North West Social Development MEC Boitumelo Moiloa says the department has been handing food parcels to school children from poor families. “We have also collaborated with the Departments of Health and Education to help bring the social ills in this community to an end,” says Moiloa.
