The High Court in Pretoria will hear an urgent application by the African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng seeking to set aside an alleged R8-million golden handshake by the City of Tshwane paid to outgoing city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola. The court postponed the matter yesterday due to a bloated court roll. The city reached a multi-million-rand deal with Mosola following allegations of irregular awarding of the half-a-billion-rand tender to controversial Glad Africa, a project management company. Mosola left office at the end of August. The court action by the ANC comes at a time when the city is still recovering from the workersâ€™ strike that collapsed services in the capital. South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) affiliated members accuse the city of granting high salary increases to senior municipal officials while ordinary workers were overlooked. Gauteng ANC Chairperson Khoshi Maepa says they will also engage the Public Protector on the matter. Maepa says they will also consider other avenues to make sure this matter is resolved to the satisfaction of the Tshwane citizens. City of Tshwane Executive Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa believes this is a political posturing exercise by the ANC. He says they will defend the matter in court. Watch below for related news:
