The Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa (CORMSA) says the South African constitution protects everyone, including undocumented foreign nationals. CORMSA is one of the Non-Governmental Organisations that briefed Parliament’s Portfolio Committee Home Affairs on the challenges that refugees and asylum-seekers are facing in the country. “The new South Africa was built on a culture of inclusiveness, tolerance and human rights embodied in its 1996 constitution.  I believe here we are mandated to promote and protect the country, which then covers everybody. When I say everybody and everyone, it means that asylum seekers, refugees, separated children, undocumented children and refugees… they should be protected because the constitution provides such mandate. So, the issues that normally affect the group we work with or the target beneficiaries, is the denial of access to refugee centres,” says CORMSA Director Thifulufheli Sinthumule.
