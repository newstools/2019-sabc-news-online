The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has dismissed an application by the controversial pastor Timothy Omotoso’s legal team. Omotoso’s trial is expected to resume in the Port Elizabeth High court on Monday. It is expected that the court will hear the findings of the SCA after Omotoso’s legal team applied for leave to appeal a decision by Judge Irma Schoeman. Omotoso’s lawyer, Peter Daubermann argued that the Port Elizabeth court does not have the jurisdiction to hear evidence led by the state; this relates to charges for the alleged offences on the indictment, which happened elsewhere in the country and abroad. However, the court does have the jurisdiction to hear all the charges on the indictment. Daubermann also wants more details from the State, about the exact charges against Omotoso and his co-accused, including evidence that backs those charges. In dismissing the application, Judge Schoeman said the directive was sufficient and was in line with the provisions set out in the Criminal Procedures Act. Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho are facing a total of 97 charges, including human trafficking and rape. Click on the video below:
