Chairperson and acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Eskom, Jabu Mabuza, says he has a clear conscience that he has no conflict of interest when it comes to the power utility. On Tuesday, Mabuza and members of the Eskom board appeared before Parliament’s Appropriations committee to discuss its turnaround plan. Asked about a possible conflict of interest in companies doing business with Eskom, Mabuza explained that the agreement between Eskom and the company in which he has shares, predates his appointment. The issue of conflict of interest was discussed at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture when Mabuza testified in February this year. He says he had disclosed his business interests that, since his appointment, have been put in a blind trust. “As I sit here, I’m clear in conscience, in no conflict. No supply relations with Eskom, all which has been done was disclosed by me. No one woke to discover I have financial interest in a company that does business with Eskom,” says Mabuza.
