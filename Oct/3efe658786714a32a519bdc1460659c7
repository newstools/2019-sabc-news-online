The Justice and Correctional Services Department has instituted an investigation into convicted rapist Nicolas Ninow’s revelation that he accessed drugs while in prison. Ninow told the High Court in Pretoria this week that he managed to use drugs several times while incarcerated during his trial. Departmental spokesperson, Singabakhu Nxumalo says Ninow’s revelations are serious cause for concern. “We have started with the investigation and it is something that is concerning, we have got to look into it.” “Once he is been allocated a cell in line with the sentence given to him on Thursday, our investigators will engage with him. He might assist us as to how he accessed the drugs and all those things, because it is an embarrassment. “It can’t be right that while people are incarcerated they find themselves in possession of drugs.” On Thursday the court sentenced Ninow to life imprisonment for raping a seven-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Silverton in September last year. He also received two five year jail terms for possession of drugs and defeating the ends of justice.
