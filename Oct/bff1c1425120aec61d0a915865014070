Convicted rapist Johannes Oelofse 60, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court in Johannesburg. Oelofse was convicted in May of raping, sexually assaulting and grooming his mentally-ill stepdaughter. These crimes happened over a seven year period at their home in Mayberry Park, south of Johannesburg. He has also been sentenced to a further 16 years behind bars however the sentences will run concurrently. During the sentencing Judge du Plessis stated that Oelofse planned the numerous rapes of his stepdaughter by sexually grooming her and forcing her to watch pornographic videos. He went on to say that Oelofse’s medical condition and age doesn’t justify him being kept out of prison on a non-custodial sentence. Throughout the sentencing Oelofse kept his head covered with his coat to avoid photos being taken of his face.
