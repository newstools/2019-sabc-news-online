The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it will prioritise settling outstanding accounts from its service and content providers while maintaining sound cash management principles. The public broadcaster on Monday received R2.1 billion of a R3.2 billion bailout from Treasury after meeting most of the conditions for the payout. The SABC says it is engaging with the Department of Communications on the remaining three pre-conditions to receive the final tranche of funding before 31 March next year. The SABC says it will also prioritise investing in new and compelling content, as well as technology and infrastructure.
