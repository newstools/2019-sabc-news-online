Voting is has started in Botswana as thousands of voters are queuing to cast their vote in the country’s 12th general elections. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party is looking to cement its hold on the government leadership. It is running against three parties, including the Umbrella for Democratic Change and the Alliance for Progressives, who have all registered presidential candidates. Over 920 000 people are expected to cast their votes in what is believed to be the most hotly contested polls in Botswana’s general elections. The Independent Electoral Commission in Botswana says over two thousand voting stations have been established across Botswana ahead of Wednesday’s polls. Meanwhile, a political analyst from the University of Botswana, Gladys Mokhawa, says the fallout between former Botswana president Ian Khama and his successor Mokgweetsi Masisi will make the country’s upcoming general elections more interesting. This will be the first time that the former president contests his former party at the polls. Khama resigned from his party and formed Botswana Patriotic Front.- Additional reporting Itumeleng Kgajane. !function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");
