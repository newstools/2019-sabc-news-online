The Special Appropriations Bill that seeks to provide additional funding to Eskom over the next two years is expected to be debated and approved in the National Assembly on Tuesday. Deputy President David Mabuza will also be back in the National Assembly on Tuesday to answer oral questions ranging from details of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement to the work of the Moral Regeneration Movement. There are 35 committee sittings scheduled for this week to consider the Budgetary Review and Recommendation Reports of various departments and entities. These reports which assess whether government departments and various entities have delivered on their mandates within their allocated budgets must be finalised before Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tables his Medium Term Budget Policy Statement next week. The portfolio committee on Home Affairs will be briefed on illegal migration. Most importantly, will be the debate on the Special Appropriation Bill which is aimed at bailing out the cash strapped Eskom to the tune of R59 billion over the next two years. The National Treasury has imposed stringent bail out conditions on Eskom in an attempt to curb the utilityâ€™s financial problems and keep the lights on.
