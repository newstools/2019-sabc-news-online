Former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni has been given until Wednesday to file an application for the postponement of her delinquent director court case. Myeni failed to appear in court on Tuesday and on Monday citing financial reasons. According to information presented before court, Myeni sits on the boards of 13 companies. However, she claims that she is unable to afford legal representation. The case against her has again been moved to Thursday citing financial reasons. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and the SAA Pilots’ Association want the court to declare Myeni a delinquent director, based on her leadership during the period 2012 and 2017. OUTA CEO Wayne Duvenage says they will oppose the application for a postponement. He says if you can’t afford you need to apply for legal aid. “I am not sure she will qualify for that since she is a property owner. If you own vehicles and you can get around you need to get to court.” “You cannot not show up, she has got a lot of answering to do. If she’s going to ask for postponement we are going to object to that. She has had ample time, she knew very well that she was not going to have the financial support of the SAA and she has left this far too late.” “She has to have an extremely strong reason. We hope we will not allow another postponement but if it does happen this will not be postponed for years,” says Duvenage. Watch full interview below:
