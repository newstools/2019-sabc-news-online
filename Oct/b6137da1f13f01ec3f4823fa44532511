Chaos has erupted outside the Welkom Magistrateâ€™s Court in the Free State. This as supporters of a 40-year-old bishop, who is accused of rape, clashed with supporters of the victim. Police were grappling to quell the tension between the two groups. The bishop had earlier appeared in court for a bail application after allegedly raping his 23-year-old stepdaughter on three occasions from when she was nine-years-old. The matter has been postponed to Thursday next week. The accused has been remanded in custody.
