AfriForum’s Head of Private Prosecutions Advocate Gerrie Nel says they’ve served papers to the National Prosecuting Authority seeking a way forward to prosecute Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema. The civil group wants Malema to face corruption charges. The matter involves millions of rands linked to Malema’s alleged money laundering activities. The matter has been pending since 2015. AfriForum says Malema must also be prosecuted for alleged assault and firing a firearm in a built-up area. The civil group has accused the NPA of delay tactics in issuing them with prosecution certification against Malema. Meanwhile, AfriForum is also awaiting a certificate to permit its legal unit to prosecute former South African Revenue Services (SARS) commissioner Tom Moyane on charges of assault and damage to property.
