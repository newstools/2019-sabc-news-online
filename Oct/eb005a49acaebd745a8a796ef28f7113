President Cyril Ramaphosa has lauded the Home Affairs Department for introducing the e-visa system that is scheduled to be launched in November. The President says the system is one of the best modernisation processes the country will see. The system was demonstrated to Ramaphosa during his visit to the Department’s Pretoria headquarters earlier on Friday. It will allow those wishing to visit South Africa from anywhere in the world to be able to apply for a visa online with validation of the visa taking place on arrival on our shores. Ramaphosa says the e-visa will assist the economy. Home Affairs is the first department that the President has visited following his promise during the 2018 State of the Nation Address to visit government departments and other key state institutions. “They have been saying to us improve visas so that you can attract more tourists and they were saying and this was also told by the President of China who said improve your visa regime and improve your safety and security, many Chinese will come as tourists to South Africa and many other leaders have said the same thing.” “Finally we are at a stage now we are going to implement the e-visa system that will put us on the map with many other countries in the world and modern economies.” Click video below:
