The George Municipality in the Western Cape says water levels in Wilderness remain critical, as work continues on the installation of a new temporary pipe on the Kaaimans Railway Bridge. The pipe broke two weeks ago and residents have had to make use of water trucks in the area. The municipality says load shedding has also posed some delays for the water reaching the reservoirs in the area. Municipal spokesperson, Chantel Adwards Klose, has appealed to residents to use water sparingly. “The levels of the six reservoirs that serve Wilderness and surrounds remains low, with water available to most areas although at a very low water pressure. Where the residents do not have water, the higher lying areas such as Hoekwel, Touwsranten and Wilderness Heights, the George municipality has supplied roaming and stationed water trucks as well as 5 000 litre water tanks,” says Klose.
