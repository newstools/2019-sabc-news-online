A Saudi minister said on Sunday that Riyadh was not behind a suspected strike against an Iranian-owned oil tanker in the Red Sea, which Iranian state-run television said was hit on Friday by missiles but denied reports they came from Saudi Arabia. “We did not engage in such behavior at all..” “This is not how we operate and that’s not how we did (it) in the past,” Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Riyadh. “The story is still not complete. So let’s wait and find out what happened before we jump to conclusions.” An Iranian government spokesperson on Saturday called the apparent targeting of an Iranian oil tanker by missiles a “cowardly attack” and said Iran would respond after the facts had been studied. “Iran is avoiding haste, carefully examining what has happened and probing facts. An appropriate response will be given to the designers of this cowardly attack, but we will wait until all aspects of the plot are clarified,” spokesperson Ali Rabei said, quoted by the official news agency IRNA.
