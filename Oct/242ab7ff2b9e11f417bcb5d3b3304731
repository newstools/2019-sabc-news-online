President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in London at the beginning of a two-day working visit.  The President will deliver the opening address at the 6th Financial Times Africa Summit on Monday. The summit is being held at Claridge’s in London.  Ramaphosa is expected to engage investors and business leaders on the sidelines of the summit, with the aim of attracting further investment into South Africa. The Financial Times Africa Summit is hosted annually by the Financial Times newspaper, with a focus on business affairs and opportunities in African countries. This year’s theme, ‘Africa in Motion’, places a special emphasis on youth, women, entrepreneurs, scientists and artists and innovation. The overarching theme is that ‘Africa’s home-made solutions are becoming more relevant as the continent takes its destiny into its own hands’. The summit will discuss business, investment as well as the political and cultural environment in Africa with expert speakers, potential investors, and innovators. President Ramaphosa is accompanied by Minister of Small Business Development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, and Presidential Special Envoy on Investment, Mcebisi Jonas. The last time the President was in London was for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April last year, but he was forced to return early to deal with protests in Mahikeng. His trip to the UK this time to try and boost investment comes as Britain enters a crucial phase in working out the future of Brexit – and therefore future trading relations with South Africa.
