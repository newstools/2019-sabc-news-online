The Hawks say they will clamp down on maladministration and corruption at municipalities across the country. Of the 257 municipalities audited by the Auditor General’s office last year, only 10 received clean audits. The Hawks have often been criticised for failing to act adequately, now the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation has put together task teams which are currently investigating municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and Gauteng. Speaking on Morning Live, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi, says the teams were set up in August last year and 17 high profile senior managers have already been arrested in KZN and the Free State. Managers of companies involved in corrupt activities with those officials have also been arrested. Mulaudzi says the work of cleaning municipalities is moving very well and at a fast pace. “Whatever information we get we need to move quickly. We want to make sure that those found to be involved in any form of corrupt activities appear in court as soon as possible.” He encourages those who may have information that may lead to more arrests to come forward.
