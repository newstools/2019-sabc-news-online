The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has reiterated that in order to qualify for a study loan, applicants must be South African citizens with a household income of under R350 000 per year. NSFAS is on a campaign drive in the Western Cape to attract applications for the 2020 academic year. NSFAS administrator Dr Randall Carolissen says only 3% of the more than 240 000 applications received so far, are from the Western Cape. Carolissen has encouraged students to also consider studying at TVET colleges and not only at public universities. “People don’t seem to think of TVET as a destination of choice while the country needs a lot of those skills. So, we want to encourage people to look differently at TVETs and also consider that as a career. We know that artisans can earn a lot more than professionals in some cases, so people must be open minded about this,” explains Carolissen.
