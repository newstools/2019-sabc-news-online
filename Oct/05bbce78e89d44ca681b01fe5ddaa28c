The Independent Electoral Commission in Botswana says over two thousand voting stations have been established across Botswana ahead of Wednesday’s polls. Four political parties including the ruling Botswana Democratic Party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change and the Alliance for Progressives, have registered presidential candidates. Commission Spokesperson Osupile Maroba says over 920 000 people have registered to vote. Maroba says, ”Those that are having sensitive material like ballot papers  are on their way to the polling stations so that first thing in the morning 6:30 they are at pollling stations,  ready to conduct the polls. So everything is set, nothing has been reported to be missing.” Meanwhile, Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi says he is confident of a free and fair election. Masisi took his party Botswana Democratic Party’s  (BDP) campaign to the rural parts of the country, to wrap up his campaigns before the midnight cut off time. The BDP has also refuted claims that it is using state resources to intimidate members of the opposition. Botswana is home to just over 2 million people, 925 000 of whom have registered to cast their votes in the 12th general elections. Masisi has ruled out any possibilities of disruptions.
