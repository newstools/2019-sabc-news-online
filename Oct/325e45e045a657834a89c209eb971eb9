Several people have been arrested amid clashes between refugees and police outside the UN High Commission for Refugees in Cape Town. The refugees want authorities to move them out of the country as they fear for their safety. They staged a sit-in at the Waldorf Building in Green Market Square for several weeks, alleging they are being attacked by South Africans. Police armed with batons and water cannons are trying to control the protesters. Some foreign nationals explain why they want to leave the country. “We are not happy; we have to go from this country. We don’t need their houses or their papers. We want to go, we want a safe place. The kids are inside there. I want to go, we are dying.” Watch video below for more:
