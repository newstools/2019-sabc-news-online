India on Sunday said that it destroyed terror camps inside neighbouring Pakistan in a retaliatory attack after militants from Pakistan attempted to infiltrate in restive Kashmir. Tensions between the two countries have flared and there has been intermittent cross-border firing since August 05, when New Delhi flooded Indian Kashmir with troops to quell unrest after it revoked the region’s special autonomous status. Islamabad has warned that changing Kashmir’s status would escalate tensions but India says the withdrawal of special status is an internal affair and is aimed at faster economic development of the territory. “In the retaliatory action that our forces have taken, we have caused severe damage to terrorist infrastructure across and terrorist camps opposite Tangdhar and Teran sectors have been destroyed,” said Indian Army Chief, Bipin Rawat, in New Delhi. Rawat added six-to-ten Pakistani soldiers and similar number of militants have been killed in a retaliatory move. Two soldiers and a civilian were killed in cross-border shelling with Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region, while Islamabad said six died on its side, making it one of the deadliest days since New Delhi revoked Kashmir’s special status in August. Kashmir has been disputed by the two nuclear-armed neighbours since they both received independence in 1947. The two countries fought two of their three wars over the region.
