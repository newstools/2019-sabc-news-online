Authorities in Hong Kong tightened security and braced for potential evening clashes between masked “Halloween” pro-democracy protesters and fancy-dressed clubbers in a popular party district in the heart of the city. Protesters, many of whom still wear now-banned face-masks, are planning to march from Victoria Park in the Causeway Bay shopping district to the Lan Kwai Fong bar and entertainment area near Central. The area is popular with office workers and party-goers including expatriates. Police have banned the march and said they would close roads including the sloping Lan Kwai Fong strip itself, from early afternoon until Friday morning to “facilitate the public celebrating.” It was not immediately clear how that would work. It is the first time protesters have targeted the party district. Typically weekends and special events like Halloween see hordes of revelers spill out of the bars and clubs. Some protesters have thrown petrol bombs at police, lit fires across the Asian financial hub and trashed buildings during five months of unrest. During previous protests, police typically fire at protesters with tear gas and water cannon. Bar owners told Reuters that the police pledged to take a low profile on the fringes of the celebrations, and to protect them. Paulo Estaban, manager of Ciao Chow, a restaurant in the heart of the strip, said the protests were not a “big concern” and that they would be “running business as usual”. Many others agreed.
