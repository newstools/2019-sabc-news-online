Cosatu has called on Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to present what it calls a serious Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). Cosatu says it wants to see a mini budget that has targets and time-frames. Cosatu Parliamentary Liaison Officer Matthew Parks says there should be a shift from the incoherence that was seen in the February 2019 Budget Speech and the 2018 MTBPS. In a statement, Parks says Cosatu wants Mboweni to present a budget that will inform the nation about  what government has done, what it will do and  how it  will get the country out of the crises it’s currently facing. Parks says the increasing unemployment rate is the greatest challenge facing South Africa, adding that thousands of workers are currently being retrenched on a monthly basis across most sectors of the economy. Parks says workers expect decisive action from government to respond to the ticking time bomb of unemployment and job losses. Cosatu says it expects Mboweni to reflect on government’s progress in implementing its share of the October 2018 Presidential Jobs Summit. Parks says the Minister should also inform the nation on how government will intervene and make sure that the business sector also honours its Jobs Summit responsibilities.
