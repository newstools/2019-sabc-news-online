The Department of Basic Education has urged parents to support their children during this exam season. Matriculants are writing English Paper One on Wednesday morning. The exams officially started last week with some of them being affected by load shedding. About two weeks ago, quality assurance body, Umalusi, expressed satisfaction over the preparedness of the department in conducting the National Senior Certificate (NSC) exams. Department Spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga says: “Make sure that they are safe. Transportation, make sure that it’s on time everywhere so that no one is late. Community members who are planning protests, please don’t do that during exam time. If you want to do it, please do so far away from schools where exams are being written because we want to make sure that there are no disruptions that are going to negatively affect the administration of the examination.” !function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");
