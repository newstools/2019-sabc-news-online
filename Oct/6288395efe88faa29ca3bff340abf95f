The National Assembly Rules Sub-Committee has proposed that a three-member independent panel be appointed to head an inquiry into the removal of office bearers of Chapter Nine institutions. This comes as Parliament deals with calls, notably by the Democratic Alliance (DA) for the removal of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. However, Parliament could not take a decision on starting the process as there are no rules in place to institute such proceedings. Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Dorries Dlakude, says the National Assembly Speaker should appoint the envisaged panel. “With regard to the appointment of the panel by the Speaker, that will be done in consultation with all political parties. We must know that we have fourteen political parties that might all come up with names or whatever suggestions to the Speaker.” ‘There should be a judge’ The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called for a judge to be part of the envisaged independent panel to probe the removal of office bearers of Chapter Nine institutions. EFF MP Ntombovuyo Mente says it is important that a member of the judiciary forms part of the panel to avoid any possible deviation from the rule of law in the process. “There should be a judge. It might happen that we want other expertise. They are also accommodated when Mr. Xaso was presenting that we may need other expertise; and therefore the other people will cover that. The reason for a judge is that, irrespective of whether we are not changing the law, we are dealing with rules that at the end of the day that are going to be taken to court.”
