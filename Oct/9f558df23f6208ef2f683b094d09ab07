Eight people have died in a collision on Saturday night on the N11 between Ladysmith and Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Two cars collided head-on.  The deceased include two children aged 6 and 3 years-old. The cause of the collision is unknown and is being investigated by police. KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services Robert McKenzie says one of the vehicles burst into flames after the crash. “Tragically eight people have sustained fatal injuries in this crash this includes two children believed to be 6 and 3 years-old. The exact cause of this crash is not known at this stage and police are investigating. After the crash the one vehicle burst into flames.” KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli says they are waiting for forensic experts to determine the identities of the deceased. “We are waiting for experts to ascertain the belongings of the vehicle. Because the Porsche did not have number plates and there were four people in the vehicle that died and they were burnt beyond recognition. And then the other one did have number plates and one of the documents that we received was that it was from a Zimbabwean origin but we are still going to ascertain that and as such we have not been able to inform the family.”
