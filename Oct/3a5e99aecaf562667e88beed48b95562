Gauteng and Free State residents are urged to significantly cut down on their water usage. This is because the Lesotho Highlands Water Project which supplies water to Gauteng has been temporarily shutdown for inspection and maintenance. The project supplies water from dams in Lesotho to the Vaal river system. The Water and Sanitation department says the shutdown will last two months and says there will be no water transfers to Gauteng during this time as the tunnel will be drained. Farmers in the Free State will be the most affected as there will be limited water supply in the area. Department spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau says there is a part of the Free State that is going to be affected. “Not that there will be no water but the will be reduced supply.” He however says there is no need for residents to panic. “This is a planned shutdown meaning a lot of work was done in anticipation of the shutdown. Water will be available and no adverse impact is expected on the system and people.” says Ratau. He says the shutdown is a necessary process in ensuring that the tunnel is in perfect working condition. “The idea is to do inspection to see whether the is a need for repair work on the tunnel.” Watch full interview below
