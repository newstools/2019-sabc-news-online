The Institute for Race Relations has submitted a petition to Parliament signed by about 40 000 South Africans who are opposed to the government’s National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill. The Bill is currently before Parliament. Former Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, who is now Senior Policy Director at the institute, says they received the signatures through their online campaign. Zille said this will form part of the submission they will make in response to Parliament’s invitation for written comments on the NHI.
