SABC board chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini says the bailout it has been seeking from government will help it realise the SABC’s strategic goals. He says the public broadcaster has met all the conditions set out by the National Treasury for it the financial injection which he says was expected soon. The SABC is struggling financially reporting a net loss of over R482-million at the end of March this year which has been blamed on losses due to Sporting rights issues and interests incurred as a result of liquidity constraints. Makhathini says the SABC is certainly turning the tide and the bailout will be an added boost. “The strategy we’ve put in place addresses a number of key areas. It talks to digital platforms, making sure our content is compelling and available in all platforms. It talks to us leveraging partnerships, it talks to us attracting competent and talent of people who’ve got expertise to do the work. It also talks to us strengthening governance issues.” Watch for more:
