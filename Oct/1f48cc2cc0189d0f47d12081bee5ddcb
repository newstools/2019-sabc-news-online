Mozambican police say they have arrested 73 people for offences connected to Tuesday’s general election. Police spokesperson, Orlando Mudumane, says they were detained in connection with 22 electoral offences, including creating disturbances in polling stations. Nine people are being held for attempting to destroy a voting centre in Sofala province. The main contenders of the presidential election come from the country’s two rival parties – FRELIMO and RENAMO – whose leaders are the incumbent, Filipe Nyusi, and Ossufo Momade respectively. Mozambicans have been urged to remain calm and wait for the results. Political analyst, Egidio Vas Raposo says, “They were very good, despite some skirmishes here and there. In general, the polling stations opened on time in most places except for far in the north, Calo Delgado province, due to security problems.” Click on the audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/757974">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Click on the video below:
