The Correctional Supervision and Parole Review Board has dismissed an application by convicted rapist and former tennis star, Bob Hewitt, for parole. The Review Board convened in Port Elizabeth to review his application. In September, Hewitt was set to be released on parole. However, this was put on hold after Justice Minister, Ronald Lamola called for a review, after learning that Hewitt’s victims were not consulted. The former tennis star was sentenced to six years in prison in 2015. After serving half of his sentence, he was eligible for parole. But this was suspended as the victims felt they had not been given an opportunity to make representations. The Justice and Correctional Services Minister then instructed the Correctional Services National Commissioner, Arthur Fraser to review the issue. The lawyer representing two of the victims, Tania Koen says they’re happy with the decision. “We are delighted by the decision of the Parole Review Board. They did not confirm the parole board’s decision, that means Hewitt remains incarcerated. A new process will be followed where the victims will be advised of a date upon which to give representation in terms of the law and the parole board will convene to consider the placement of Hewitt on parole.” Chairperson of the Correctional Supervision and Parole Review Board, Judge Siraj Desai says they considered a number of factors in reaching this decision. “We consider the matter. We consider the reasons given by the parole board that heard the matter and we decided whether we agree with their decisions or not. We are a national body. So, we have a national perspective of what parole should look like for the country.” A new date will be set for the Parole Board to re-consider Bob Hewitt’s parole application. In the meantime, he will remain in the St Albans prison outside Port Elizabeth. Watch a related video below for more on the story:
