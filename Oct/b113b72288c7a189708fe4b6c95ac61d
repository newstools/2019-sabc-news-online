Former MEC of Finance in the Free State, Elizabeth Rockman has confirmed that she has met one of the Gupta brothers in August 2011. She told the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that she met him during a provincial Executive Committee meeting in Bethlehem. Rockman says he was presenting the New Age Newspaper’s interest in advertising the Free State government. She says prior to the meeting she received a call from former Premier, Ace Magashule and told her to meet with him for subscriptions for paper in the Free State. Rockman says however it was not strange for people who were not part of the provincial government structure to attend Executive Committee meetings. She says: “It was also not strange for private people to show up at venues where we had executive committee meetings.” “The idea was that the office of the premier would enter into a subscription agreement on behalf of all departments. At that time we were moving towards transversal contracts. We for example used a media bulk buyer.”
