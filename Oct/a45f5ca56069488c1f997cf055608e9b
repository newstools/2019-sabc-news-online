Former Democratic Alliance (DA) National Chairperson, Athol Trollip has confirmed that he will not only end his political career at national level, but also at local government level. He was the former executive mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, who was controversially ousted by the United Democratic Movement’s Mongameli Bobani. Trollip resigned as national chairperson on Wednesday minutes after Mmusi Maimane announced his resignation as DA leader. Trollip is still a party councillor in the metro, but not for long. He says, “I am going to be resigning as a councillor at the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. I am busy discussing when that exit will take place, with my provincial leader Nqaba Banga, because the last thing we want is to have a vacancy in the council, especially with the motions of no confidence still in the pipeline. So, as soon as that is sorted out and addressed and there is a replacement for me, I will be leaving the Nelson Mandela Bay Council.” Click below to watch related video:
