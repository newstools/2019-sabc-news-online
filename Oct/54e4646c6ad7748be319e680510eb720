The Water Research Commission says it’s hoping that more young people will consider farming as a career choice. The commission says its running a successful school based project in Mamelodi in Tshwane, which it hopes to roll out across the country. This comes as the globe prepares to mark World Food Day on Wednesday. The Water Research Commission, in partnership with the Agriculture Department and the Agriculture Research Council are holding discussions ahead of World Food Day. The Water Research Commission’s Professor Sylvester Mpandeli says:”Its not about producing vegetable crops but we are also trying to change the mind-set of those kids to see that you can take agriculture as a career.” “You can be a full-fledged commercial farmer and we are interacting with those schools, we are planning to roll that program all over in Gauteng and other provinces in the country.” Click video below:
