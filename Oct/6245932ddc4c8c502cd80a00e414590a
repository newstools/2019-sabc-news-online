There’s positive news for consumers as the price of fuel is expected to drop next month. The Automobile Association (AA) anticipates a petrol price drop of between 8 and 18 cents a litre, 14 cents for diesel and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin. AA Spokesperson Layton Beard says this is based on unaudited month-end fuel price data that the Central Energy Fund has released. “The rand has pulled back from its high point from the start of October and the on-going decline in the average exchange rate has meant that most of its loss has been clawed back. Whatever happens to the oil and the rand from this point on onwards, will affect the price motorists will be paying at the pumps going into Christmas and we certainly hope that the downward trend continues,” adds Beard.
