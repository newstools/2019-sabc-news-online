Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is exploring his legal options, relating to the judgment in the hate speech matter between him and EFF leader Julius Malema. The Equality Court has ruled that Malema’s utterances, calling Gordhan a dog of white monopoly capital, does not constitute hate speech. Gordhan demanded R150 000 in damages to be paid to a charitable cause. He also wanted an unconditional apology from the EFF leader. The court has found that while Malema’s utterances were indeed hateful, they do not constitute hate speech. Legal expert Ulrich le Roux says that Malema’s comments were not made against a specific or classified group in South Africa. “The main reason for this court making this finding was the fact that Julius Malema’s comments, although offensive, were not made against a specific or identified or classified group in South Africa. This differs vastly from for example, the Penny Sparrow comments which were levelled against a specific ethnic group. ” EFF Secretary General, Godrich Gardee, says the party is pleased with the judgment. “The Economic Freedom Fighters do welcome the judgment of the court. It has confirmed our earlier assertions that the opposition has got no other weapon to hold the executive and the ruling party accountable except political rights and political freedom of speech as an opposition party. It’s not over it seems. In a statement released, Gordhan has noted the judgment but is seeking legal advice to take the matter forward. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
