The bail application of the University of KwaZulu-Natal student accused of killing his roommate has been postponed to Monday next week. Khayelihle Nzimande appeared in the Pinetown Magistrateâ€™s Court. He is accused of murdering Simukelo Zondi whose burnt body was discovered in the bushes at the university over the weekend. Zondi was reported missing last Thursday by his girlfriend. The university has suspended lectures at its Westville campus on Monday in order to hold a 24-hour prayer session for Zondi. When the accused entered the court he immediately demanded to speak to his family saying that it is within his right to have his family inside the court to help him make a decision if he will be represented by the legal aid attorney or by a private attorney. The court granted him a five minute adjournment and he spoke to an elderly man and afterwards the court told him that he would have to wait for another week to apply for bail. His formal bail application will be heard on the 21st of October. Watch video below:
