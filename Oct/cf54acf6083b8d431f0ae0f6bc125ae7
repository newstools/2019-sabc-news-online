Congresswoman Maxine Waters has challenged the youth of the country to make sure that they carry on with the legacy of the late former president of the African National Congress, OR Tambo. She was delivering the sixth OR Tambo Memorial Lecture in Boksburg on Gauteng East Rand. Waters says Tambo made sure that the young people continued to be a symbol of hope to the elders. The United States based activist and public servant says there’s a lot to learn from the late Oliver Tambo. “This was president Tambo’s gift…South Africa’s promising youth. I want you to know that OR built the ANC on the values and on a foundation of humanitarian values and he was given by the ANC the moral high ground. His undeniable voters granted him a chance to fight the Apartheid regime. His values were helpful because they were and remain fundamental human rights.” Click video below:
