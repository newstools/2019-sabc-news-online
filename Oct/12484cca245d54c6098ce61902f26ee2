The South African Human Rights Commission will take allegations of racism against Springbok rugby player, Eben Etzebeth, to the Equality Court in Vredenburg on the Cape West Coast on Friday morning.  The SAHRC held a public meeting in Langebaan on Thursday night to brief the community about the process dealing with complaints of racism and alleged assault laid by Enver Wilsnach. The Khoisan Defiance Campaign has approached the SAHRC to handle the case. Head of Legal Services, Buang Jones, says they will be filing their case to start the process to hold Etzebeth to account for the alleged racist utterances made against Wisnach. “We asking the court to ask Mr. Etzebeth to pay for damage, to offer an unconditional public apology to the complainant and all South Africans, restrained from making any further discriminatory remarks or hateful remarks against Coloured people, undergo anger management.”  Community members attending the meeting have welcomed the SAHRC decision. But others say the player should not be found guilty prematurely. Etzebeth has denied the allegations levelled against him. In a statement, SA Rugby says it has instituted internal processes in the matter and that the details remain an employment matter between SA Rugby and the player. Click on the video below:
