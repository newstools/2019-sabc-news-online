The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has given the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health until January 2020 to resolve all the challenges facing health facilities in the province. KwaZulu-Natal Nehawu Secretary Ayanda Zulu says they are concerned about the state of public health care in the province, ahead of the full implementation of the National Health Insurance. “We are calling on the Department of Health in KZN to take our workers to realise the full potential of the NHI. The current state of the public health care system, we are having some serious crisis. We’ve got inadequate equipment across hospitals and clinics. Quite a significant number of posts that are currently vacant. The union is calling for the total filling of all funded vacant posts and the proper running of these hospitals and clinics,” says Zulu.
