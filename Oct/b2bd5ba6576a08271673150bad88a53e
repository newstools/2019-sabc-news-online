Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, has thanked former City of Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, for his service in the DA as well as to the residents of Johannesburg. Mashaba resigned on Monday from the DA as the Mayor of Johannesburg after the election of Helen Zille as the party’s Federal Council Chairperson. Mashaba, who took office in 2016, says he is deeply concerned about the politics of the DA – and will cease serving as Mayor from the 27th of November. Speaking during a media briefing in Johannesburg alongside the former mayor Maimane said Mashaba made Johannesburg a better place than it was under the African National Congess. “There can be no doubt that Joburg is a better place today than it was under the ANC and for the members of staff here working under the difficult coalition arrangements, it is a better place to work under than it was under the ANC. That is fair to say. I want to thank you, not only as a resident of Joburg, but as a South African. Thank you for always driving the ambition to serve our country and the people and our paths together will continue to charter a journey of building this one SA. God Bless you,” says Maimane.
