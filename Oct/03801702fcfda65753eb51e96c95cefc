The Democratic Alliance (DA) has launched a rural safety plan, involving reservists and drone technology, to make rural areas safer. The DA’s Spokesperson on Police in Parliament, Andrew Whitfield, says the plan is aimed at getting communities involved by establishing rural community policing units. He says one of these units will be established for every police station. Whitfield says the aim is for communities to become involved in their safety and security. “RCPU (RISC Central Processing Unit) reservists will work just like SAPS reservists, receive specific rural police training and act as ‘part-time rural policemen’. Their support members will have at least one function, become specialists with skills necessary for rural policing, and work with rural reservists under the command and supervision of SAPS,” says Whitfield.
