Struggling state-owned defence company, Denel, has reported an operating loss of R1.9 billion for the year to March 31, it said on Friday. Group Executive Officer Danie du Toit says a decline in reputation formed part of the reason for their dwindling financial position. He says revenue had dropped by 36% over the period. Earlier this week the ANCâ€™s National Executive Committee said one of the priorities of the governing party would be dealing with the financial woes of state-owned enterprises. This followed a four-day meeting where the NEC discussed the issue of economic development in South Africa.
