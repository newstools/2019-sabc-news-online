The Pietermaritzburg High Court is expected to hand down its decision in the matter between the Newcastle Municipality on the northern KwaZulu-Natal and Eskom. The municipality is trying to stop Eskom from cutting off power supply. The municipality owes Eskom about R200 million that has been accumulating since 2012. Last month Eskom threatened to cut off electricity however the municipality managed to secure an interim court interdict halting the interval electricity cut offs. The municipality said it is committed in paying Eskom an amount that they can afford.
