The High Court in Pretoria has warned that no further postponements will be allowed after granting former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni yet another postponement in her delinquency trial – this time to 27 of January 2020. Myeni’s legal representatives argued that they wanted to make amendments to her plea. She also wanted other executives and non-executives who took decisions at the national carrier to also stand trial. Judge Ronel Tolmay delivered the ruling, “All interlocutory arguments will be heard on the 25th of November.” Judge Tolmay says although she is not happy with the delays, the court has a responsibility to oversee a fair trial.
