Former Communications Minister, Faith Muthambi, has indicated that she wants an opportunity to clear her name; saying she never protected former SABC Chief Operating Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng. A report, released in August, named her as being among those who engaged in editorial interference at the SABC. The report implicated several employees and high-ranking officials, including Muthambi and Motsoeneng, as among those who allegedly bullied journalists and gave instructions to the editorial team, despite not being mandated to do so. Muthambi says that she has done nothing wrong. “I have done nothing wrong and I will insist that I must be given an opportunity to clear my name. I never protected Hlaudi, you must give me a fact where I protected Hlaudi. Hlaudi was an employee of the SABC and the COO of a company who could exercise his responsibility as a member of the executive.”
