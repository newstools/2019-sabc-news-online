African National Congress (ANC) National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe has again spoken out against continued factionalism in the party. He was delivering the OR Tambo Lecture, which the ANC’s Dullah Omar region organised in the Western Cape on Saturday. Mantashe told a group of ANC supporters that it was unacceptable that party members were still divided according to the candidates they supported at the party’s last elective conference. He says infighting in the province has cost the party votes. “You are cadres of the moment. That’s why comrades it’s not only wrong; it is mischievous to have people who are permanently CR and permanently NDZ. It’s not only wrong, it’s mischievous.”
