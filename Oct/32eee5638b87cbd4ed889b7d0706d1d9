The Pietermaritzburg High Court is expected to hear an appeal from former President Jacob Zuma against the ruling dismissing his application for a permanent stay of prosecution in his corruption case on the 22nd of November. State prosecutor advocate Billy Downer has told the court that the State and Defence have discussed the appeal process with the KwaZulu-Natal Judge President Achmat Jappie. The state will oppose the application. Downer has told the court that the state is eager for the trial to start as soon as possible next year. “On the State side, when the matter was put down for the roll, we said from the beginning that the State is ready for the trial – so we are ready to set the trial there, and we remain ready, and there are a number of practical things that prevent us… and the first thing is that we were informed that they will be an appeal on the part of the accused that will overturn the permanent stay judgment.
