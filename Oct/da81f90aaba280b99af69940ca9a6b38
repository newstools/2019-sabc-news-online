South African Communist Party (SACP) General-Secretary Blade Nzimande has added his voice to calls for an end to gender-based violence. He was addressing a rally in Mthatha as part Red October celebrations.  Red October, also known as the October Uprising, originated from Russia in 1917 under Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik Party to promote socialism and the interest of the poor. Nzimande says all communities should join the fight against gender-based violence. “We must mobilise in our communities to ensure that we confront this scourge of gender-based violence. We cannot be proud of being in a country where 51% of our population is always either experiencing violence or always under a shadow of violence.”  Nzimande has also lambasted his party’s leadership for not paying attention to what has been happening in the OR Tambo District in the Eastern Cape. He has criticised members of his party for what he terms watching corruption happen right under their noses in some transport infrastructure development projects. “Every leader district from all the alliance must know all the developments that are taking place here at OR Tambo District. We are sick and tired of being told that there is a road that should have been tarred and it has been budgeted three times and the money has been spent, but the road is not done.”
