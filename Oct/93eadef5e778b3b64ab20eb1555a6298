Eskom says it needs to recover R100 billion in electricity tariffs from consumers to achieve cost reflective prices and to remain sustainable. The power utility is under fire for implementing Stage 2 load shedding for the rest of the week, which it has blamed on severe generation capacity challenges. It has filed three court applications against the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) challenging its tariff decisions since 2014. Corporate Specialist in Economic Regulation at Eskom Deon Joubert says, “There are court processes underway, and if you add them up, address roughly the R100 billion that we calculated right now of shortfalls accumulating from 2014. Of that R100 billion, nearly half – R48 billion is already being addressed in year 2021 and year 2022. So that already takes care of half of your R100 billion and at what impact to the consumer, 16.7%, 16.7,” Joubert explains.
