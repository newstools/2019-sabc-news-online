The main opposition party in Botswana, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), says it is now in a more powerful position to win Wednesday’s elections. This despite the departure of the Botswana Movement for Democracy. The Umbrella for Democratic Change is a coalition of three opposition parties, formed before the 2014 general elections. It went on to win a record 20 seats of the 57 seats in parliament. Two new parties, Alliance for Progressives and former president Ian Khama’s Botswana Patriotic Front are also likely to split the opposition vote. UDC president Duma Boko says they will change things. “We will create 100 ooo jobs, because the situation is dire. We will pay our people a living wage of not less than 3 000 pula, because their situation of poverty is also dire. We will give pensioners an old age pension of 1 500 pula per month, because the abject poverty in which they live in an upper middle income economy is totally unjustifiable.”  Watch related video:
