Teaching and learning in 35 schools from the OR Tambo coastal district in the Eastern Cape has been disrupted since the end of September. This amid a protest by communities over delays in the tarring of a road from St Barnabas Hospital in Libode to Hluleka on the wild coast. More than 16 000 learners, from Grade 1 to 12, are affected. Education Department Spokesperson, Malibongwe Mtima, says they’re doing all they can to ensure that learners prepare for their exams. “We are in constant communication with the local leadership, but a solution may occur and prevail. Apart from that, we are working with the local churches, traditional tribal authorities including other organisations that are communicable to ensure that they support us in allowing the learners to do revision in their centres. Our educators avail themselves when they are in need; because another thing that we have done is to promote group studies by these learners. Remember, we finish our syllabus in August, from mid-August going to October all we do is revision,” says Mtima.
