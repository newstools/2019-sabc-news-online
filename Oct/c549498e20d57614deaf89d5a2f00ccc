The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has staged an evening picket outside the residence of the controversial Gupta family in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. The foundation says it’s in support of South Africa’s moves to have the Guptas extradited back to South Africa to answer for their alleged involvement in state capture. They’ve been accused of influencing the appointment of ministers during the Jacob Zuma era, as well as influencing the awarding of state tenders in their favour. Ahmed Kathrada Foundation’s Neeshan Bolton says: “They need to be brought back to this country, they need to be held accountable for all the allegations that they’re facing. And if they are found guilty they need to see the inside of a prison cell.” “There’s almost about 50 people here, standing with placards outside the main entrance of the Gupta compound. We had permission for a small picket, we didn’t plan on having a large demonstration.” “And this is not the last of it. And whoever is housing the Guptas and Salim Essa, our call is on them to work with the SA government to extradite them back to the country.” Related video click below:
