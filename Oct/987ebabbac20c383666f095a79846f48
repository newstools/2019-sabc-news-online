It is alleged that 11 learners have been caught cheating while writing their History paper in the Eastern Cape. This comes after all matric learners signed a pledge that they would face the consequences if they were caught cheating. “As the department we take this very, very seriously and we want to inform everyone that results of the candidates that have been caught with crib notes are blocked in indicated subjects and a hearing will be conducted. If found guilty, the results will be nullified and some may be banned from participating in examinations from one up to three years. That’s a sanction,” says Provincial Education spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima.
