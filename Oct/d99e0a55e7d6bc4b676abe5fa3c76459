The new African National Congress (ANC) online membership system to be piloted in provinces such as KwaZulu-Natal might result in the postponement of eagerly awaited regional conferences. That’s according to ANC provincial Secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli. The new system allows members to renew and apply for membership online. The new membership cards will also be used to control access to party meetings. Among the regional conferences scheduled towards the end of the year, are those of the eThekwini and the Moses Mabhida region. Addressing a media briefing in Durban, Ntuli  said they are yet to get a response from the office of the Secretary General. “Our initial plan was that conferences were going to take place before the end of the year. But the head office has since introduced a new membership system which they intended and they have already begun to pilot in KZN and other provinces where there are going to be conferences. In the last meeting of the NEC, we gave a feedback to the SG about some of the difficulties arising from the new system. So we asked the SG to look at the possibility of us continuing with the old system, so that we can live to our own commitment to hold conferences before the end of December.”
