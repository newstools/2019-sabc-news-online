The Hawks say they have raided the homes of 12 other officials charged along with former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede. On Thursday, the Hawks along with the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) raided Gumede’s home in Inanda as well as a home she was apparently renting in Umhlanga. However, they found that she had moved out of the Umhlanga house. Gumede’s decision to change her address without informing the investigating officer is in breach of her bail conditions. She is facing fraud and corruption charges in connection with the R208 million waste management tender. Hawks spokesperson, Hangwani Mulaudzi, says they have seized cash and an undisclosed amount of money from the homes of other accused. He says they will ensure that they seized all assets they believe the accused acquired through corrupt activities. “Of course there are other operations that are taking place in and around Durban of the other 12 accused attached to her case who are also being raided today and searched. We will be hearing a lot today in terms of the seizures that will be taken. We will wait for the report this afternoon. But what we want to confirm is that we are working with AFU and we are going make sure that all those assets that we believe the suspects might have gotten through their corrupt activities will be under curatorship today,” says Mulaudzi.
