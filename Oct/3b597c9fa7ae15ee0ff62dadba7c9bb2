The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng will support Zimbabwe’s Day of Action against economic sanctions. The party says it will picket outside the embassies of the European Union and the United States in Pretoria on Friday. In Zimbabwe, a national march is expected to take place in the capital Harare. The country wants Western countries to lift the sanctions imposed on it. Zimbabwe’s economy is continuing to deteriorate; the recent inflation marker sat at 300% in August. The African Union has called for the lifting of the sanctions. The ANC in Gauteng says the sanctions have made it difficult for the government of Zimbabwe to access lines of credit and debt relief. This is, in turn, making the recovery of the country difficult as well. The march will leave from the Pretoria Art Museum Park at 9 am and move towards the EU and American embassies.
