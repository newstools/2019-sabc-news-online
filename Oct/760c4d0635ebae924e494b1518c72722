The Congress of the People (COPE) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to immediately sack current Eskom Chairperson and Acting CEO Jabu Mabuza. The party says both Ramaphosa and Mabuza should take full responsibility for what it calls the immense harm Eskom’s failure to keep the lights on has caused on the already struggling economy. Eskom has been implementing loadshedding in the past week following technical problems at the Medupi Power Station. COPE spokesperson Dennis Bloem says Mabuza should be replaced to save the economy from further damage. “Why is he still sitting there? He must be relieved of his duties with immediate effect. President Cyril Ramaphosa must fire Jabu Mabuza who is sitting there with two heads as chairperson and CEO (Acting CEO). It is proven that he is not fit to hold that position. We are sitting in a limbo. We don’t know what is going to happen the next moment,” says Bloem.
