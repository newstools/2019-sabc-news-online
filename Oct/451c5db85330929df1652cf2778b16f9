The trial of former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni is expected to start on Monday – with or without her. Myeni failed to show up twice earlier this month for the case – brought against her by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) – and the SAA Pilots Association. She then pleaded poverty, saying that she could not afford a lawyer – because she was unemployed. According to OUTA, SAA incurred losses of up to R16-billion between 2012 and 2017 – while Myeni was at helm of the airline. Judge Ronel Tolmay told the court that there have been too many delays – and the case will continue – with or without her. Click on the video below:
