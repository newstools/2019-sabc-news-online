Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has highlighted the negative impacts of purchasing counterfeit goods and the illegal downloading of online content – saying it has the potential of destroying legitimate businesses. Cele was addressing the Intellectual Property Crime Conference in Cape Town. He says governments across the globe are addressing the challenges associated with the sale of counterfeit goods. “Everybody understands that it is wrong to walk into a store and take something without paying. At the same time, the act of downloading a moving from a file-sharing site or buying a cheap knock-off of a name brand item may seem harmless, but the reality is that the accumulated economic loss from those illegal transactions can destroy small, medium and large legitimate businesses. It is clear that we have a shared and unwavering commitment to addressing the challenge of the influx of counterfeit goods in the marketplace,” says Cele. Click link for more:
