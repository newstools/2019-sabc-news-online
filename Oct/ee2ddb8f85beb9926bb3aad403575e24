Tshwane Emergency Services say they have provided some residents of Daspoort in Pretoria West with alternative accommodation following a fire that destroyed at least 30 shacks last night. However, an angry mob is still blocking the Bremmer road, demanding that the City provide them with alternative accommodation. Tshwane emergency services spokesperson, Charles Mabaso says some rescue officials had to retreat from the area as they feared for their safety. Mabaso says, “We work those activities together with social development. So the accommodation was done last night. One of the city officials on the scene was saying that people are closing the street, they have to retreat for their safety.”
