African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has encouraged the South African Communist Party (SACP) to continue critiquing the ruling party and to remain a thought leader of society. Ramaphosa was speaking at a seminar in Rivonia in Johannesburg celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the publication, the African Communist. The magazine was started by a group of Marxist-Leninists in October 1959. The ANC President says the publication and the SACP must continue their work of strengthening Africa’s democracy. “We view the journal as an integral part of our revolutionary conscience, warning us of the slow pace of socio-economic transformation, the dangers of corruption and capture of the state by private corporate interest.” “The erosion of our moral credibility, the weakening of state organs and the resultant decline in our electoral support all of these have been warnings but they also need to be turned into the call to action.” Click video below:
