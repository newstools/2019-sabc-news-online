Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has denied her outgoing deputy Kevin Malunga’s allegations that he was sidelined from handling high-profile cases. In an interview with the SABC, Malunga also raised concern on a number of cases the office of the Public Protector has lost in the past few months.  Mkhwebane says there is no evidence suggesting that some high-profile cases were investigated in secrecy. She was speaking after addressing students at the Tshwane University of Technology at the Soshanguve South Campus, north of Pretoria. “In this environment of security of the country, you are dealing with the security of the people, the infrastructure; you are dealing with the security of documents; you are dealing with the security of information; you are dealing with the security of your systems. So, the kind of work which has been delegated to the DPP, he did that and any other investigator who did the work. So, there is nothing which is done in secret.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
