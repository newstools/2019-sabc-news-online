Botswana’s Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) says it has completed counting of council votes and has now started with parliamentary votes. There seems to be a tight contest between Botswana Democratic Party and the Umbrella for Democratic Change in the council votes. Botswana Chief Justice Terence Rannowane will announce the President-elect once one of the contesting parties reaches a threshold of 29 seats, with the overall results expected on Friday. Botswana IEC Spokesperson, Osupile Maroba says they are waiting in anticipation. “We wait in anticipation. We hope by the end of today, we should be having quite a number of them. If at all, they started at the same time yesterday. Some constituencies are very small, some constituencies are very big and they experienced very high turnout and those are the constituencies that would probably take us to maybe even tomorrow morning because counting itself is very slow. It’s manual,” explains Maroba.
