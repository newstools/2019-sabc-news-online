Democratic Alliance Shadow Minister of Home Affairs, Haniff Hoosen, says strong action must be taken against former Minister Malusi Gigaba for approving the early naturalisation of the Gupta family without following due procedures. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has found that the early naturalisation of the Gupta family was fraudulent. It has concluded its investigation into the naturalisation of the influential family. According to the committee, the Guptas did not comply with the requirements to renounce Indian citizenship. It recommends that criminal charges be taken against the Guptas and intermediary Ashu Chawla for falsifying naturalisation citizenship. Hoosen says Gigaba must be held accountable as he knew what he was doing. “This whole process went so quickly. There are number of people who apply for citizenship and it takes years to get it, but the family received it in a matter of 30-days. The appeal was made to Gigaba and ultimately, he put his signature on to that application. So, there is no way he could have been duped. He claimed to be senior and smart. It’s clear to us that he was directly involved and he knew exactly what he was doing and we want him to be held accountable in that final report.” Watch for more for more on the story:
