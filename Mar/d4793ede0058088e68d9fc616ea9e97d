Zimbabwean President Emerson Mnangagwa says he has put measures in place to ensure lasting political stability and reignite his country’s economy. He was speaking at the start of the third Bi-National Commission (BNC) underway in the capital Harare on Tuesday. President Cyril Ramaphosa is in Harare with a high powered ministerial delegation to review the progress made in the implementation of the bilateral agreements since the last BNC in 2017. Both countries have so far signed 45 bilateral agreements in different fields including trade and industry and ICT among others. President Mnangagwa says they are working to take his country to new heights. “My government is determined to spin forth from a period of economic stagnation to progress. We are implementing a comprehensive agenda that will see us becoming a middle income economy by 2030. On the political front, my administration is addressing matters to do with peace and stability. We have begun an all-inclusive national political dialogue and I have also appointed a presidential advisory council,” says Mnangagwa. With South Africans experiencing economic hardships due to rocketing fuel prices and high electricity tariffs, President Cyril Ramaphosa says the country will only give support to Zimbabwe within its means. Zimbabwe is in dire economic situation following targetted sanctions buy the EU and the United States. Although speculation is rife that the R5.6 billion National Railways of Zimbabwe deal will be on the agenda of today’s meeting, President Ramaphosa says any commitment will be informed by the country’s economic capacity.
