Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, described the latest bullying incident, captured on video, as attempted murder. He visited Crystal Park High School in Benoni on the East Rand where five pupils were arrested. They face charges of intent to cause grievous bodily harm. In the video, a group of girls are seen beating up a defenceless grade 9 learner. Lesufi met pupils and teachers and he lashed out at the bullies. He also called on police to do what they need to. “When that video was sent to me I was shaken, I was shocked and emotionally stressed. You can see from that video. We just lucky that the parents have given us the scans results that that child is not harmed. That was clear attempted murder nothing else. Whoever can say whatever they want to say that’s clear attempted murder? Even when restrained, they attack again and you can see that the person attacked is defenceless, is down and not attacking you and you continue to attack.” The five were arrested after the mother of the victim laid a charge. The school says it’s working to assist all those involved. More arrests are expected. Watch video below:
