Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he will always remember his wife for being loving and supportive since they met. Buthelezi paid tribute to his wife Princess Irene during her funeral service at the Ulundi Stadium in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Buthelezi and Princess Irene were married for close to 67 years. He has described Princess Irene as his best friend who played an important role in raising their children. “Her love was expressed not only in words and thoughtful acts, but in the amount of time she spent praying for me, for our children and our family.” “She prayed for us through all the ups and downs, Irene was my anchor and now she is gone. I will listen now to our favourite music, and close my eyes and imagine that she is still here. Her smile will be in the music.” Click video below:
