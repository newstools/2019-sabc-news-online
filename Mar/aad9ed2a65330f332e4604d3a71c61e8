The ANC says it has applied to cross-examine former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi – who testified before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Thursday – and leveled several allegations against the party and its leadership. In a statement, the ANC says it will, at an appropriate time, present itself to the Commission where it will make a full submission on all allegations tabled against it. Meanwhile, Environmental Affairs Minister and ANC NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane says she intends to provide the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture with an honest account of her relationship with Bosasa chief executive, Gavin Watson and his family. This following damning allegations by former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, during his testimony at the commission on Thursday. Agrizzi told the Commission sitting in Johannesburg about how Bosasa now known as African Global Operation paid Mokonyane R50 000 in monthly cash bribes. Agrizzi dropped a bombshell during his testimony on Thursday saying the ANC top leadership received donations of between R10 million and R12 million. However, he did not elaborate when these donations were made. Mokonyane wants to appear before the Commission to clear her name. She tweeted on Thursday that she intends to give an honest account of her relationship with the Watson family, her previous role as the ANC’s Head of Elections and Organising as well as her role in government in so far as they relate to the false allegations of bribery of her by Bosasa.
