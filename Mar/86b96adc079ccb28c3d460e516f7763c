Police watchdog IPID is investigating the shooting of a former learner by police in Mpumalanga. A video of a violent attack by the ex-pupil has gone viral. The man is understood to have demanded to see the headmaster prior to the attack. One police officer was also injured in the altercation after the man allegedly dragged her out the police vehicle. In a video that went viral on Thursday, the man can be seen brazenly smashing windows with bricks. Moments later, police sped onto the scene, but this didn’t deter the ex-pupil as he went on a rampage attacking the police, who then retaliated by shooting the former pupil. Sibusiso Malaza, Mpumalanga Education MEC, says they will be investigating the issue of security. “The issue of security we still need to investigate because we do not appoint security, the school governing body does. So we need to find out what happened there, why there was no security.” The video sparked a public debate; were the police justified in shooting the man? Moses Dlamini of IPID says that they will be taking statements. “We have seen the video and we will be taking statements because the matter was reported to us very late.” The National Minister of Education Angie Motshekga says it’s not an education issue. She believes that ultimately violence originates from communities and homes. “There was an interview with a psychologist on school violence…we are confronted with societal problems as a department.” The man is in hospital under police arrest. It’s also unclear why he was demanding to see the principal. He faces charges of damaging property and for attacking the police officers. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
