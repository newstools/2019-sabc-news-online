Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, says he would like Jacob Zuma to appear before the commission. Speaking on Morning Live on Thursday, Zondo says Zuma can explain what he knows about the state capture that allegedly happened while he was still president. Former President Zuma was forced to set up the commission to get to the bottom of allegations of state capture. He announced that the inquiry into his alleged dodgy relationship with the Gupta family would be set up last year after a court ruled that the remedial action that former public protector Thuli Madonsela had recommended in the State capture report, was legally binding. Zondo says: “Former president Zuma was the president during a certain time. There are allegations about certain things that are said to have happened during the time that he was president of the country. He has himself as I understand from his lawyers, made it clear that he will co-operate with the commission in every way; there should be no problem whatsoever in him coming forward.” “We will hear more evidence and at a certain stage, I believe he will come.” Watch below for more
