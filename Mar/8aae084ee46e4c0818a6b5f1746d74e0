The family of Matlhomola Mosoeu is disappointed in the sentences handed to two men convicted of murdering their 15-year-old son in 2017 in Coligny in the North West. 28-year-old Pieter Doorewaard and 35-year-old Phillip Schutte will serve 18 years and 23 years, respectively. Sentence was handed down in the North West High Court in Mahikeng Wednesday morning. Judge Ronnie Hendricks was swift in the sentencing proceedings. He accused heard their fate within an hour. “Accused No.: 1, on a count of murder, you’re sentenced to 15 years, kidnapping three years, intimidation two years; theft one year; pointing of firearm two years. You’re sentences on count two, three, four and seven will run concurrently. ‘Accused No.: 2 on count one, you’re sentenced to 20 years; kidnapping three years; intimidation two years; theft one year; pointing of firearm two years. It is ordered that the sentences on count two, three, four, seven will run concurrently. So, accused No.: 2, you will effectively serve 23 years imprisonment.” Mosoeu’s father, Sakie Dingake, says the family expected more. “I’m not satisfied. The sentences are not long. I’ll never see my child again.” The NPA was also hoping for harsher sentences.  Senior Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Thembeka Mbadu, says they expected life sentences. “We would’ve been happy if we got life sentences, but after hearing the judge, we have accepted that the sentences that court has given are appropriate.” The community of Coligny was also unhappy with the sentences. “We wished for a much longer sentence, especially life sentencing,” says one community member. “They should’ve been given life sentencing.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
