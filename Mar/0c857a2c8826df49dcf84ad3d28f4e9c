Over the past few days, witnesses who saw the burning of a Ford Kuga SUV in the Wilderness in the Southern Cape more than three years ago, have testified about the events that night. Reshall Jimmy died when his vehicle caught alight. An inquest into his death is underway in the High Court in Cape Town. The motor giant denies any wrongdoing and the National Prosecuting Authority also decided not to prosecute.  The matter continues on Wednesday. Since the start of the week, two witnesses have thus far testified about their account of events on the burning of Jimmy’s Ford Kuga SUV. One of the eyewitnesses testified that they heard a loud bang and a woman screaming which led him to go investigate. Andrew Roberts another witness was put through the wringer by the lawyer for Afriforum and the lawyer for Jimmy family, Gerrie Nel about his statement to the police which differed to the statement he gave to the Ford Motor Company’s lawyers. Nel also questioned Roberts interactions with the then Ford CEO Jeff Nemeth who requested Roberts to give a statement to the company after he had already given one to the police. During questioning on Tuesday, Roberts was asked if he received money from Ford but said he received no financial gain.
