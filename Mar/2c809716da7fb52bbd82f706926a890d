SABC group CEO Madoda Mxakwe has offered the assurance that workers at the public broadcaster will indeed be paid their March salaries. The SABC’s hardcopy presentation to the Parliament Communications Committee said the public broadcaster could not guarantee that it would be able to pay staff at the end of March. The SABC group executive board members appeared before the Communications Committee to brief it about the progress made on its turnaround strategy. Mxakwe says, “So indeed we can confirm that end of March all SABC employees will receive their salaries. Owing to our current liquidity crisis, there is a whole lot of issues that we had to do from a financial point of view and I think what is helping now is that we have been working very closely with the department of communications to ensure that  we re-capitalise the SABC. So that will help a great deal.” Click on videos below:
