The Social Revolutionary Worker’s Party (SRWP) has threatened to boycott all American products if the US fails to lift sanctions against Venezuela and allow the country to manage its own affairs. Venezuela has been in turmoil following the recent elections that saw Nicolas Majuro clinch his second term as president. In response, the US threw its lot in with the leader of the opposition Juan Guaido, who swore himself in as interim president. The SRWP, Saftu and Numsa members have become a voice for Venezuela. Certain media reports have described unrest and desperation in the South American country due to the political crisis. But the party representatives who visited the country disagree. SRWP Acting National Spokesperson Vuyolwethu Toli says:”For the party, this demonstration in solidarity with many others is taking place across the world.” Numsa’s Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says:”After emerging from the consulate, party leaders appeared disappointed.” While the US has pulled out its remaining diplomats from Venezuela, it remains set on the sitting president. Numsa has also praised the South African government’s vote against a US resolution to back Guaido. The unions and parties say they will return to Sandton in two weeks for a response.
