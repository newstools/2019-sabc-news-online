ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has confirmed that they have received a letter from the lawyers representing some disgruntled members of the party in the North West. The members are demanding that the national leadership should reverse its decision of disbanding the provincial task team led by Premier Job Mokgoro. This after the party last week disbanded both the PTT and Supra Mahumapelo’s led PEC. A new PTT led by NEC member, Obed Bapela, was then established to run the affairs of the party in the province. Magashule says the ANC cannot be run by lawyers. “We have received a letter from their lawyers, but the ANC is not run by any lawyer. The ANC is a revolutionary organisation, so we will see what they say because the national executive committee of the ANC has the right to take decisions in between the national conferences.” Meanwhile, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, has rubbished claims that the Rapid Response Team, led by his Deputy David Mabuza, has no powers to work on provincial and regional structures. It is through their intervention that the previous PTT and PEC were dissolved. Ramaphosa has defended the decision. He says: “This is based on a lack of understanding of how the structures of the ANC, especially the NWC came to the decision. So, I don’t think that in the end that is going to have great significance.” Watch related videos below:
