UDM Secretary-General, Bongani Msomi, says that they know that Prince Buthelezi is what he is because of his late wife. “We know that Prince Buthelezi is what he is because of this lady who has passed away so we are here now to say what has happened has also happened to others because she has played her part. So we are now asking the family of the Buthelezi let her rest in peace.” Preparations for her funeral service at the uLundi stadium this Friday are underway. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
