The lawyers of Duduzane Zuma are bringing in an application to discharge him on a charge of culpable homicide at the Randburg Magistrates’ Court, north of Johannesburg. Former President Jacob Zuma is attending the trial. Duduzane is facing one count of culpable homicide and another of reckless and negligent driving. The second count of culpable homicide was withdrawn yesterday. Zuma junior’s vehicle – a Porche 911 turbo – crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 highway in January 2014, resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube on the scene.
