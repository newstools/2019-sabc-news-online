Eskom says although it remains optimistic that power cuts will not be effected this week, its power system is still vulnerable, and load shedding will be implemented only if absolutely necessary. Last week, the country was plunged into hours of darkness as the power utility struggled with generating units at some stations. It says imports from Mozambique was strained due to Cyclone Idai hitting the region. Eskom’s Andrew Etzinger explains,”If you look at last Monday and compare it over the last 7 days the plant performance has improved significantly. It is still poor as I understand it but it was atrocious last week. It is sitting at about 12500MW out of service, we’ve got that number to around 10000 so we have about 2500MW available. Plus with the cyclone that took out two lines in Moz, one of those is back and giving us about 3/4 of the normal supply. Diesel is available . We are in a good situation going into the new week.” Listen to Eskom’s Andrew Etzinger speaking to Stephen Grootes on SAfm’s Sunrise. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/669075">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
