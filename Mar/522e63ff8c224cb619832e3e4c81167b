Johannesburg’s City Power says it has managed to restore power to the areas north of Johannesburg which were affected by Wednesday’s fire at an Eskom Allandale substation. Several areas around Midrand were left without power. Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena says, “Both city power and Eskom customers have confirmed that they are now back on. Our technicians and those from Eskom will remain there in the Allandale substation to monitor the situation and also to finalise their investigation into the cause of the initial fire. We are hoping that there will be no further challenges to customers in terms of electricity supply in the area so customers can have supply into the weekend.” Watch related videos below for more on the story:
