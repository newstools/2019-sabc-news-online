Authorities in Kenya say families of the victims of Sundayâ€™s deadly plane crash in Ethiopia will be sent to the country to assist in the identification of their loved ones. Out of the 157 people killed in the crash, Kenya suffered the most casualties with 32 of its citizens on board. The plane was en route to Nairobi from Addis Ababa when it crashed shortly after taking off. Cabinet minister in charge of transport James Macharia briefed the media and said they expect that probably at the beginning of Tuesday, members of the families can be dispatched to Ethiopia to help with the process of identification of loved ones in case they need DNA samples, the relatives will be able to provide that information. Out of the 32 family members, only 25 have been contacted. For the latest, Sarah Kimani has more:
