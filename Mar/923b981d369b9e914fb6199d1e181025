The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State is threatening to march to the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) provincial offices against the termination of contracts of NET 1 employees. More than 150 employees of NET 1 received letters of termination of their contracts. NET 1 was contracted by Sassa to help pay social grants. The Constitutional Court ruled after a lengthy legal tussle that the contract was improperly awarded to the company. The EFF wants Sassa to absorb the employees. “We are giving the relevant department an ultimatum to hire the employees on permanent basis in order to comply with constitutional ruling on labour brokers. We are of the firm understanding that once the highest court in the land has made a ruling. We must all comply with it. No one has the right to act contrary to the decision of the Constitutional Court, not even Sassa. Failure to act up to our expectations by Sassa will leave us with no option, but to take legal action to embark on a mass action this is our view as Economic Freedom Fighters and that is what we are going to follow,” says EFF Provincial Secretary Bosanku Msimanga. Sassa has expressed sympathy on the loss of jobs by employees of NET 1. Sassa Provincial Spokesperson Sandy Godlwana says their services would not be affected as they have a new partner in the South African Post Office. “But our focus is on Sassa transition and our partnership with the South African Post Office. We are saying the termination of the contract with Net 1 won’t affect our payments. Our beneficiaries would still get paid. They can still make sure that they use our Sassa card. If they have any problems they are more than welcomed to visit our offices. We want to make sure that the payment of social grant is a successful one. We are happy with the fact that we are now working in partnership with the post office to ensure that our beneficiaries get the right social grants at the right time.”
