President Cyril Ramaphosa has declined to directly answer a Democratic Alliance (DA) question in Parliament regarding how much money his son earned from a contract with the controversial Bosasa company. DA leader Mmusi Maimane waived what he said was the Bosasa contract in question where the amount of money earned by Ramaphosa’s son, Andile, was hidden. Ramaphosa replied that the matter was being investigated by the Public Protector and he could not comment on the amount. African National Congress (ANC) linked Bosasa had earned billions in contracts with the government and now faces liquidation following revelations at the State Capture Commission. The DA’s John Steenhuisen sparred with speaker Baleka Mbete. <a href="http://iono.fm/e/663233">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> President Ramaphosa also told Parliament that any possible reform of the Reserve Bank would be carefully considered. The ANC in 2017 resolved to reconsider the central bank’s mandate – among other things. The Reserve Bank currently focuses on keeping the inflation rate within its target of 3 to 6%. However some observers say the bank should also focus on economic growth. Ramaphosa has acknowledged the importance of the bank to the economy. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/663239">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
