Residents of KwaSthebe in Mandeni, Northern KwaZulu-Natal, have taken to the streets demanding the removal of the town’s Mayor Sphesihle Zulu. They are accusing him of corruption, mismanagement and preventing service delivery in the area. Local factories and businesses have shut doors and roads entering and exiting the area are barricaded by tree trunks, burning tyres and stones. Angry protesters are demanding rapid change in Mandeni’s Local Municipality management. Resident Jabulani Biyela says that the mayor must step down immediately. “The mayor must step down immediately because of the corruption that is so rampant in this municipality.” Protesters say they will not rest until their demands are met. Resident Gugu Ndlovu has threatened not to vote. “We will not vote at all or we will vandalise every factory and business around KwaSthebe.” Zulu says that they are yet to receive a list of the community’s grievances. “On Monday the 25th, they marched to our municipal offices, but the challenge that we are facing is that there was no written memorandum of grievances, but we are receiving issues raised in different platforms.” The area remains tense and under heavy police watch.
