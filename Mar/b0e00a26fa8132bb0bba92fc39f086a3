The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng calls on motorists not to panic over threats of blacklisting over e-tolls bills. The party views the ill-calculated move by the Electronic Toll Collection company, acting on behalf of Sanral, as an unfortunate act of provocation. This after people of the province had been asking for the scrapping of e-tolls. In a statement, ANC in the province says, “It is now widely accepted among various stakeholders that tolls in major urban areas like Gauteng are not viable as they add to the already high cost of living for commuters.” Gauteng Premier David Makhura had assured the people that President Cyril Ramaphosa was paying his urgent to the matter. The e-tolling system is one of the thorny issues that motorists have been grappling with throughout all other expenses. The party assured Gauteng motorists not to panic. It says “It is a resolution of our conference that the e-Tolls scheme should be done away with and that an alternative solution will have to be found in order to maintain and expand the road network in the province.” While awaiting a tangible response from national government on an amicable resolution to the matter, the ANC says it welcomes the pronouncement made by the Credit Bureau Association, whose members hold judgement information relating to consumers, that  “information relating to e-Tolls / SANRAL will not be held on the credit bureaus,” and that any information relating to this issue “which has been inadvertently loaded onto a consumer profile will be removed”.
