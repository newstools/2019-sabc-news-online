A 40-year-old man has been arrested in Seshego near Polokwane for allegedly raping his 14-year-old step-daughter. Police say the girl’s mother had left her in the care of the suspect when the incident happened. It is alleged that the suspect had entered the room in which the child had been bathing and attacked her. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says the suspect will appear in court on Monday. Ngoepe says the Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS in Limpopo, Lt General Nneke Ledwaba, has strongly condemned the continuous acts of violence perpetrated against children. He says: “Members of the community, especially mothers are urged to double their efforts in child safety to help prevent the occurrence of these type of incidents.”
