President Cyril Ramaphosa says the government should move with speed to address the backlogs of infrastructure in the education and health sectors. President Ramaphosa says poor infrastructure impacts negatively on the rights of children. Limpopo is one of the provinces with huge backlogs of schools and health facilities. Ramaphosa was speaking during the opening of the refurbished Marobathota High School and Evelyn Lekganyane Clinic at the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) headquarters, Moria, outside Polokwane, in Limpopo. “Together, we must address with urgency the backlogs in the provision of schools and health infrastructure. These backlogs in the public infrastructure space impact negatively on our children’s rights to decent basic education and to health, safety, dignity within the education facility sphere.” ZCC leader Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane says a lack of skills and corruption hamper development in the country. Bishop Lekganyane has also expressed concern about the high rate of crime and unemployment. “We must undoubtedly accept that the lack of skill is a very disturbing challenge to move to the next level of defeating the series of social ills; defeating us, including, amongst others, poverty unemployment high rate of corruption, crime … inhuman, gruesome and barbaric crimes against humans and children and myriad of challenges.” The church has spent R54 million to refurbish the school. It accommodates learners from various parts of the country.
