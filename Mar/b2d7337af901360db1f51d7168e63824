A woman who staged a protest while half naked in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria is expected to appear in court soon. Gugu Ncube, accompanied by a member of the Shut Down Movement wanted to highlight her plight regarding the sexual harassment incident she allegedly endured from a colleague at UNISA’s Centre for Early Childhood Education. The centre has since issued a statement saying after investigating the allegations, it found no basis to charge the accused colleague due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Police Spokesperson, Daniel Mavimbela, says the woman will be charged for public indecency. “There’s a woman who was allegedly standing naked in front of the Union Buildings. On our arrival, we effected an arrest and we are expecting the person to be charged with public indecency and if that happens, she’s expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court soon. It is an offence for any person to stand without their clothes in full view of members of the public or in a public place which Union Buildings happened to be one. As a result of that, we were forced to effect an arrest, and, as I said she’s expected to be charged with public indecency,” says Mavimbela. The University of South Africa says the woman who staged a naked protest at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, was never its employee. Gugu Ncube accompanied by a member of the Shut Down Movement wanted to highlight her plight regarding the sexual harassment incident she allegedly endured from a colleague at UNISA’s Centre for Early Childhood Education (UCECE). In a statement, UNISA says the UCECE is an autonomous organisation and expressed concern that Ncube continued to name it in her dispute with the UCECE. UNISA says when it heard of Ncube’s complaint it followed due process and even provided Ncube with counselling. It says after thorough investigation, it has established that there was no basis to charge the staff members concerned with the alleged offences. See related tweets below:
