Two suspects have appeared at the Esikhwawini Magistrateâ€™s Court on three separate charges of murder. Thandanani and Muzikawuqedwa Ngwane were arrested in connection with three of more than 20 murders in the Mphembeni area, outside Richards Bay. Most of the victims were local African National Congress (ANC) leaders. More than 20 people have been murdered in the area. It is believed the killings are connected to tenders, involving local politicians. This after a local mining company opened business opportunities for locals. Family members who joined angry locals outside court want justice. One of the two suspects who appeared briefly faces three separate murder charges. The Inter-Ministerial Task team investigating politically-motivated killings has received much praise from the community. The suspects will be back in court on the 1st of April for a bail application and they were remanded in custody.
