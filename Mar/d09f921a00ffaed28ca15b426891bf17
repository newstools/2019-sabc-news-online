Former Acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and his co-accused, SAPS Supply Chain Management Head Ravichandran Pillay  have been granted R20 000 bail each. Phahlane and Pillay appeared in the Johannesburg’s Specialised Commercial Crimes Court following their arrest on Friday morning. They face charges of fraud, corruption and forgery relating to an R86 million blue light tender. The case has been postponed to March 29. In 2018, IPID arrested a number of high profile police officers for the same case. This is not the first time Phahlane appears in court. In 2018 his home was raided and him and his wife were arrested for a forensic equipment tender. The case was provisionally withdrawn in November, but is expected to be reinstated soon. During Friday’s court appearance Phahlane asked to be released on free bail, however, the court granted him and Pillay R20 000 bail each. Phahlane’s lawyer gave an impassioned presentation in court, saying that the arrest was a set up and the media seemed to know more about it than his client. Click video below:
