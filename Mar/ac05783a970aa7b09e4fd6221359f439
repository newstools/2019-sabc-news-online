The family of a KwaZulu-Natal woman who died in the Bahamas have expressed their disappointment that her body will not be returning home for burial. 29-year-old Nobuhle Bhengu fell ill while working on board a cruise ship. She was admitted to a hospital in the Bahamas where she died last month. The family has been trying for the last three weeks to get her body repatriated to South Africa. Speaking on Morning Live, Bhengu’s sister Mbali says the family has now agreed to a cremation. “Now they’ve changed their story telling us that now they don’t have the necessary equipment to help protect other countries from whatever bacteria from spreading and they’ve also said now they don’t have the licence to help get the body through other countries to ensure them that the body was not contaminated…” The Bhengu family from Umlazi in Durban family is preparing to travel to the Bahamas to view the body of Nobuhle Bhengu before it is cremated. Nobuhle’s sister Mbali Bhengu says as traditional people they need to prepare her body and bring her spirit back home… “Right now we’re busy packing and the government is busy getting our paper work done so we can leave tonight to the Bahamas to at least be there and get to see her and perform what we traditional people do when any one passes away. We will try and talk to her spirit and try to get it to come back home.” Click on video below:
