Eskom says it has managed to fully restore electricity to large parts of Johannesburg that had experienced power failures earlier. Eskom General Manager for Transmission Grid Jacob Matshinjike says there was a fault at their Craighall substation in Randburg. He says the substation was undergoing routine maintenance. Matshinjike says the problem also affected another substation in Midrand. “We were able to restore the transmission network just after 3 pm this afternoon.” “So any restoration of power is now the function of how distribution circuits are now being switched back to connect all the consumers that are down streamed.” “But as far as the major network transmission is concerned we are back to normal.” Related video click below:
