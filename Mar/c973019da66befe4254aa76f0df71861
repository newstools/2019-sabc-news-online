Soweto commuters have urged Gauteng Transport MEC, Ishmail Vadi, not to lift the suspension of major routes in the area for taxi associations WATA and NANDUWE until peace is achieved. Vadi met with commuters in Soweto, in the south of Johannesburg Tuesday night to discuss a way forward following the taxi violence earlier this month. The two taxi associations were involved in a deadly clash over routes that left three dead. Commuters say Vadi should insist on a peaceful end to the conflict between WATA and NANDUWE. One commuter says: “I was one of the people that was affected in that riot on that day. I had a gun pointed at me by people I don’t know.” “We are not animals and taxi owners must realise this. Please listen to us, we commuters need you. I think this three months will open their brains to think about their commuters, about what the value of a person is. “They don’t consider us, it’s all about them. Do not lift the suspension until both parties know the value of communities. It cannot be correct that our kids, parents and brothers are the ones who are victims of this violence.” Related Video
