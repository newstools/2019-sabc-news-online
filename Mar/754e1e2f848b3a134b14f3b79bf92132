The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) says it is concerned over reports that Energy Minister, Jeff Radebe, allegedly signed a R14.5 billion oil deal with the Sudanese government last year. The reports also alleged that Radebe led a team to South Sudan to pursue the deal. The Democratic Alliance (DA) claims Radebe signed the deal without approval of the Treasury and Cabinet and says it will submit an application to the Energy Department to force the Minister to disclose the alleged agreement. SAFTU General-Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, says signing a deal of this financial magnitude is worrying, at a time when the economy is stagnating. “We are taking this matter quite seriously precisely because of the amounts that are being mentioned. A R14.5 billion in the context of South Africa’s economy that has stagnated that is expected to grow at 1.8 and now expected to grow below that estimation for 2019 is a worrying factor. It’s R14.5 billion allegedly going to be spent on some refinery in South Sudan unexplained to the public,” says Vavi. Watch the full interview below:
