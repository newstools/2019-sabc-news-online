Former Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula is set to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg on Friday. Earlier this month, Former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the Commission that Mbalula had an emotional reaction during the ANCâ€™s NEC meetings over an interaction he had with one of the Gupta brothers. Manuel revealed that at the NEC meeting in August 2011, Mbalula cried while talking about an engagement he had with one of the Gupta brothers in 2010. It was during this interaction that he was told that he would become sports minister. According to Manuel, Former President Jacob Zuma was present at that NEC Meeting. Click on videos below:
