An NGO called “Movement Against Abuse in Churches” has applauded Cheryl Zondi for deciding to testify yet again in the rape trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso, following the recusal of Judge Mandela Makaula. Zondi made the announcement at a press briefing in Johannesburg. She said that despite the fact that she is going to have to re-live the trauma of testifying, she is more determined than ever to see the case through. On Friday, Judge Makaula officially recused himself, after it emerged that his wife owned the guesthouse where state witnesses in the case stayed. Director of “Movement Against Abuse in Churches” Solomon Ashoms says Zondi has their full support. “You know for her to continue with it, emotionally and spiritually it has affected her in a lot of ways, but she has identified that by virtue of the fact that she has been given a role in this whole thing unfortunately, she has to take it on. And for us as the movement against abuse in churches, we really support her and we are really encouraged that she didn’t throw this out, but to continue with it,” says Ashoms.
