The key finding of the report of the High Level Review Panel on the State Security Agency (SSA), is that there has been political malpurposing and factionalisation of the intelligence community over the past decade or more. This has resulted in an almost disregard for the Constitution. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday authorised the publication of the report, which has assessed the mandate, capacity and organisational integrity of the agency. The report proposes the urgent development of a National Security Strategy  “as an overriding basis for redefining and refining the concepts, values, policies, practices and architecture involved in South Africa’s approach to security.” In addition, the report suggests the review should consider the separation of the SSA into two services – a domestic and a foreign service – with “prudent delineation of scope”. Ramaphosa appointed the panel in June 2018 to assess the structure of the SSA. He asked it to assist to ensure a responsible and accountable national intelligence capability for the country. Former cabinet minister Sydney Mufamadi is the chairperson of the panel. The Presidency has shared the report with a range of stakeholders including State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba, Inspector-General of Intelligence, Dr Setlhomamaru Dintwe, and Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. A redacted version of the High Level Review Panel on the State Security Agency has been declassified.
