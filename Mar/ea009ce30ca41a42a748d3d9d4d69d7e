Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, has blamed some foreign nationals for contributing to the crime rate in South Africa, saying specific nationalities are involved in drugs, cash-in-transit heists, violence and even murders. He was speaking at post-budget discussions on Wednesday. Makhura says he is not being xenophobic but talks should be held with countries whose citizens enter South Africa and commit crimes. “Some specific crimes, specific nationalities are involved – drugs, violence, murders and CIT heists. To say this, is not to make a particular nationality a problem. The police have to crack down. How often do you find Nigerians involved in drugs? We don’t want to make Nigerians in general a problem, but we must ask the question, how do we have so many drug dens that are operated by Nigerians in our country? We’ve got to solve that problem and we also have to make it a problem with Nigeria,” says Makhura. Watch a related video below:
