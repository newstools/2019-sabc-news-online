Gauteng Premier David Makhura has welcomed the arrest of Mamelodi taxi boss Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela. Mathibela handed himself over to the police on Tuesday night in Germiston on Gauteng’s East Rand. Police obtained a warrant of arrest on Monday following cases of extortion, intimidation and assault leveled against him. Mathibela is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court soon. Makhura’s Spokesperson, Castro Ngobese, says that Mathibela’s arrest is a victory for Gauteng. “This, to us, is a victory because in Gauteng, we have been facing high levels of crime and we are happy that police are working hard in making sure that they arrest criminals that have been terrorising our communities. We hope now that the law will take its course because Khekhe is being accused of serious crimes. His arrest is very important and it should be welcomed by the community of Tshwane.”
