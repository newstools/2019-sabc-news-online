Taxi organisation, SANTACO says a taxi fare increase may be on the cards in light of the steep fuel hike that will take effect on Wednesday. This is in response to an announcement by the Energy Department that the petrol price will rise by R1.34, diesel by R0. 82 and illuminating paraffin by R0.63 a litre. The Department cited a number of factors as causes for the hike, including a weak Rand against the dollar and higher oil crude prices in the international market. SANTACO’s president, Philip Taibos says the national executive will meet tomorrow to chart a way forward. “It’s putting us in such a very precarious position. We service the poorest of the poor. We service people who go every day and look for work. We are forced to be looking at the prices. We are going to look into these petrol prices, but I don’t see a way in which the taxi industry will not increase. The increase is imminent because we must keep these vehicles on the road and keep on servicing people.”
