SANParks has confirmed that it has captured the roaming lion, Mafusa who escaped from the Karoo National Park, near Beaufort West in the Karoo, nearly a month ago. SANParks spokesperson, Fayroush Loudick, says Mafusa, a two-year-old male is being kept in a police cell in Sutherland, Northern Cape until a crate is sent for it to be transported back to the park. Mafusa travelled almost 270 kilometres from the Park. The big cat escaped by digging a hole underneath a fence at the park after heavy rains. Several trackers on foot as well as aerial support were called in to track the animal since its escape. The lion has killed four sheep and two goats since escaping. This is the second lion to have escaped from the park in recent years. In 2016, Sylvester made headlines when he got out twice.
