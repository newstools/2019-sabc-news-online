The National Student Financial Aid Scheme(NSFAS) has urged all students who were unsuccessful in their bid for financial assistance to lodge their appeals by this Friday. NSFAS has received almost 15 000 appeals. It’s approved over 3 000 and has received over 7 000 appeals without supporting documents. The deadline had been extended from November last year. NSFAS Administrator Randall Carolissen says, “Students must complete an appeals form which can be downloaded from NSFAS and submit to NSFAS or an institution of their study with the relevant supporting documents.” He says, “An appeal for first time entering students need to be submitted directly to NSFAS along with required supporting documents. Appeals for returning students need to be submitted at the Financial Aid office or Student Support office at the institution along with supporting documents.” Related Video
