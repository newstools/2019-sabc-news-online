Kwaito star Pitch Black Afro has been denied bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. The 40 year-old Soweto-born rapper whose real name Thulani Ngcobo is charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice for allegedly killing his wife Catherine Modisane on the 31st of December in Yeoville. The court found that Ngcobo failed to put forward a convincing argument to warrant him being released on bail. The NPA’s Phindi Mjonondwana says they are happy with the court’s decision. “We are in agreement with the court as Thulani Ngcobo also faces charges of defeating the ends of justice in that the state alleges he tried to conceal evidence at crime scene therefore there’s likelihood that if he is released on bail he will interfere with ongoing investigations furthermore he failed to produce fixed address therefore the likelihood of evasion of trial was existent in this matter.” Watch related video:
