Gauteng Premier David Makhura has welcomed roads agency Sanral’s decision to suspend the process of collecting e-toll debt. On Wednesday, Sanral said it would not apply for new summonses against e-toll defaulters. This followed the Sanral board’s decision to suspend the collection of historic e-toll debt that dates back to 2015 after President Cyril Ramaphosa’s intervention. Sanral says the roads agency’s board will constantly monitor and review the decision. Makhura says urban tolling is not a viable option and it has never worked anywhere in the world. His spokesperson Castro Ngobese says: “We have said many times that e-tolls are not viable and they impact negatively on the cost of doing business in Gauteng but also they are a burden to the citizens of our province.” “Therefore, we welcome this decision that has been taken and we will continue engaging with the national government until we find a lasting solution.” Related Video
