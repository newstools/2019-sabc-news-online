Taxi commuters in Soweto can rest assured that taxis from both Dube West and the Witwatersrand taxi associations will continue operating on Monday. Last week, Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi, threatened to shut down their routes and ranks, following the on-going violence between the two associations. Discussions between the two associations are still underway, and a resolution to stop the violence between them is expected to be made later on Monday. Last week, six people were wounded and 10 vehicles damaged following a shootout between members of the two associations over control of the routes. National Taxi Alliance spokesperson Theo Malele says, “Both operators are still on the ground and with regards to a solution, parties have been engaging throughout the weekend and we are hopeful that perhaps by midday or somewhere around then, we should have something tangible to put before the MEC and give him reason not to close the routes and we are hopeful parties will find each other by today (Monday).”  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
