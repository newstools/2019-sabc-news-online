The World Health Organization (WHO) is targeting 900 000 people for vaccinations against cholera in Mozambique following the devastation of Cyclone Idai. The WHO and the UN Humanitarian Mission addressed the media in Beira earlier on Thursday. The WHO’s David Wightwick says 5 cases of cholera have been confirmed so far. Many other patients are being closely monitored. Following concern over the outbreak of waterborne diseases,  Wightwick says their target is to vaccinate at least 900 000 people as of next week Monday.  The vaccines are urgently being flown into Mozambique.  The UN has also set up 9 vaccination centres.  Besides cholera, Mozambique is also dealing with an increased number of malaria cases.
