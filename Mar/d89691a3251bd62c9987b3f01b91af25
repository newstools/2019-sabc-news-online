A female warder based at Goedemoed Correctional Service centre in Aliwal North, in the Eastern Cape has been stabbed to death by an inmate after being held hostage at the centre with her fellow female colleague. Police spokesperson Motantshi Makhele says the inmate serving a life sentence who was performing cleaning duties, allegedly forced both officials into an office where he locked himself with them. Authorities at the centre mobilised response teams including SAPS hostage negotiators who negotiated the release of the officials for almost three hours. When the teams entered the office they discovered the body of the 35 year-old prison warder with stab wounds. Her 33 year-old colleague was still alive and treated for shock. The prisoner faces charges of murder and other charges might be added.
