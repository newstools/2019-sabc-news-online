The United Nations has condemned Friday’s deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand. At least 49 people were killed when Australian-born Brenton Tarrant entered two mosques and shot indiscriminately at people after Friday prayers. The 28-year-old appeared in court on Saturday and was charged with murder. A raft of further charges are expected.  French Ambassador, Anne Gueguen, led the UN Security Council in the moment of silence. “On behalf of the members of the Security Council I condemn in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack on two Mosques in Christchurch New Zealand. This hateful act left at least 49 people dead and dozens wounded. They were targeted at their place of worship.” Gueguen added: “The members of the Council express their deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed and they offer their sympathy to the people and the government of New Zealand.” The UN Secretary General’s spokesperson Stephane Dujarric added to this saying: “The Secretary General is shocked and appalled at the terrorist attack at two Mosques in Christchurch New Zealand. He extends his deepest condolences to the families and the victims and to the government and people of New Zealand.” “The Secretary General recalls the sanctity of Mosques and all places of worship. He calls on all people for this holy day of Muslims to show signs of solidarity with the bereaved Islamic community. The Secretary General reiterates the urgency of working better globally to counter Islamophobia and eliminate intolerance and violence extremism in all its forms.” Related Videos
