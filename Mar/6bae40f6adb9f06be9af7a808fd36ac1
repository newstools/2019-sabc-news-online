The Department of Basic Education has condemned the ongoing interruption of learners’ education due to lack of scholar transport in some areas of Madibeng in the North West province. According to some parents, learners at Rekopantswe Secondary School in Fafung have been absent from school as their scholar transport failed to show up for the past two weeks. Learners from Klipvoor, Kwariekraal and Ga-rasai villages are the worst affected. The department is putting the blame on the Transport Department which renders the service. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says this is a course for concern. ” We are extremely concerned in fact we are shocked that there’s such a matter that has continued for such a long time compromising the education of the learners because of something that has nothing to do with them. We call upon the departments of education and that of transport in North West to address this urgently. We cannot afford that learners loose school time on an issue that has nothing to do with them.”
