The land development dispute between private developer Karin Mohammad and the City of Tshwane has pitted the African National Congress (ANC) against the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the council. The ANC Youth League in Tshwane claims Mohammad is donating land to poor people in Eldoraigne in Centurion. But his application to develop the land for low-cost housing was rejected. The city says Mohammad can still appeal the decision. The ANC Youth League in the area says it has already identified families who will be allocated that land. “Mr Karin came to us as the ANC Youth League and told us that he’s donating the land, but this land must be given to people who want to stay here. It must be poor communities, in particular people of Mooiplats and people of Oliven, so that we can develop a nice informal settlement in this area. He came to us after he was frustrated when the DA and its youth wing; the EFF, blocked him from doing this. He came to us, approached us. We’ve identified a number of families. There will be 200 families that will stay here,” says Lesego Makhubela, Tshwane ANCYL. The DA in Gauteng says it has approached relevant authorities, seeking intervention. Gauteng DA Campaign Manager, Fred Nel, says signs erected near the site bearing DA and EFF logos are a violation of election laws. “We are aware of the signs that went up in Centurion. I can confirm that the DA is not involved in any housing scheme in the area. The signs were put up illegally and the use of our logo is also illegal. We’ve taken up the matter with the IEC because it is against the Electoral Act to use our logo without our permission and we are waiting for the IEC to take action against the private developer for putting it up. He also did not have the permission to put on the ward councillor’s number and name on these signs. Watch a related video below:
