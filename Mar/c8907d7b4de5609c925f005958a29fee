The cash-strapped Makhanda-based Makana Municipality  in the Eastern Cape has promised to pay Eskom R12 million on Friday to avert power supply interruptions. The municipality is racing against time to settle its its R84 million Eskom debt which dates back to 2013 Eskom has issued a notice that it will implement power supply interruptions on the second of next month from six in the morning to eight in the evening if the municipality does not  settle the bill. Mayor Mzukisi Mphahlwa is hopeful there won’t be any power supply interruptions. “We have not defaulted, we have been paying Eskom regularly but we have been paying the current account. It is the historical debt that we have struggled with. We are planning to have a meeting with Eskom in the next coming weeks, the municipality officials, Cogta and Eskom after we have paid this amount and then we are going to review the whole repayment plan.” Eskom’s acting provincial spokesperson, Zama Mpondwana, says they haven’t received any communication from the municipality so far. “So far nothing has been reached in terms of a deal or an agreement with the municipality. We are still waiting for them to come forward.”
