Flights to and from the East London Airport have had to be grounded or diverted due to a technical glitch. Airports Company South Africa Airports Company –ACSA says the landing system has been out of action. ACSA’s Senzeni Ndebele says they are hoping the problem will be fixed by the end of the day. “The flights have not been able to land, and have left Port Elizabeth back to Durban. The one from Johannesburg is still grounded in Port Elizabeth; we’ve managed to have one flight landing in East London today which was a flight from Durban operated by Airlink.” “So we are working together on the instrument landing system to ensure that possibly by tomorrow morning we can have it up and working.”
