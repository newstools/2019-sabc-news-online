In the wake of the so-called resurrection miracle, there are fresh allegations against Prophet Alph Lukau’s Alleluia Ministries International. It has emerged that some congregants are used to faking illnesses and disability during sermons to stage miracles. In an SABC News exclusive, Samantha Revesai has spoken of how she was allegedly cured of HIV after being prayed for by Lukau. Revesai says she visited the church in late 2017 asking for prayers in the hope of finding a job. She says she was given a paper from a doctor showing the results of her HIV negative status.  But she says the whole thing was staged. “I was not positive, I have never been positive, they wanted me to act as if I was positive and then pastor prayed for me. I then get healed so that they can attract other people to come to the church. They promised me money; they said they were going to give R1.5K every month.” Catch the full story on Cutting Edge on Tuesday at 9:30pm on SABC 1. Click on video below:
