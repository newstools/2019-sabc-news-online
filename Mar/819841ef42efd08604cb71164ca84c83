The suspect, who was arrested in connection with the murder of Matwetwe lead actor Sibusiso Khwinana, will remain behind bars until 17 May. He made a brief appearance in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court and faces charges of murder, robbery and contravention of the Immigration Act charges. A day after Khwinana was laid to rest, the suspect appeared in court for his murder. Khwinana was stabbed to death during an alleged armed robbery in Pretoria. The NPA Spokesperson, Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane, confirmed that the suspect was arrested and appeared in court. “The NPA confirms that a 35-year-old male appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court today; charged with murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and contravention of the Immigrants Act. This is in relation to the murder of our local star, Mr Khwinana.” The court ruled that the suspect’s identity should not be revealed at this stage as this would infringe on his right to a fair trial. “We have also requested as the state for the court to make an order that his name nor his images be published at the stage due to the fact to hold an ID parade as the state, therefore we don’t want anything that will jeopardise the process.” The police say a manhunt is continuing for other two suspects. The accused will remain in custody.
