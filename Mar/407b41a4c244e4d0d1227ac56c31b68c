Tuberculosis (TB) survivors say stigmatisation undermines efforts to fight the spread of the disease. This emerged at the commemoration of World TB day in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape.  TB is one of the leading infectious diseases in South Africa as more than 100 000 people die from TB annually. Defaulting on medication and lack of awareness are contributing factors. Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, says that he is concerned by the number of people dying from TB and encouraged people to get screened regularly to prevent the spread of the disease.  Survivor Zoleka Swakimba says that people have discriminated against her for having TB and that makes her feel like she has committed a crime.  The Department of Health took its awareness programme to the popular highway rank. Eastern Cape Health MEC, Helen Sauls August has asked the taxi association to pledge to the programme. “We believe as we roll out this programme, we ask taxi association to pledge so that we can set up mobile units and bring our staff here and bring chronic medication so that our people don’t have to sit in our facilities.” Lucky Mvelo, Deputy Chairperson of Kuyasa Taxi Association has expressed appreciation for the government initiative. “We appreciate what the government is doing because we as taxi drivers, we don’t have time to go to clinics for check-ups, we will lose out on money.”  The community of Mdantsane also received a wide range of health services as part of TB commemoration day.
