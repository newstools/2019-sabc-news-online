President Cyril Ramaphosa rolled up his sleeves and put in some work as he took part in the Good Green Deeds campaign he launched on Friday. He paid a visit to the Highway Taxi Rank in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape and assisted by cleaning up the area. He also planted a tree at Eco Park behind the taxi rank. President Ramphosa continued his city wide launch programme in Buffalo City. This was en-route to the Sisa Dukashe stadium in Mdantsane. That’s where he launched the Green Deeds programme. The President started off at the beach on Friday morning in East London. The program is aimed at encouraging South Africans to be environmentally conscious. It also puts the focus on sustainable waste management practices such as recycling. Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says:”Our people cannot have open spaces dumping sights, but rather be used as part of recreation as part of green and clean city and part of green and clean township and we need to make sure we have an integrated plan that deals with a clean environment.” Related video click below:
