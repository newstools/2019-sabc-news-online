Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has challenged scientists and researchers to come up with child friendly Tuberculosis (TB) medication. Currently children are taking reduced dosages of the same drugs administered to adults. It is estimated that 1.6 million people globally die of TB each year with 10% of them being children. “How do we explain ourselves in this world where science and technology is so extraordinarily advanced; when you give TB treatment to a new born you have to break a pill. Nothing was developed for newborns, syrups for newborns it’s a big struggle for mothers who have got children. “Nobody can provide this answer, we couldn’t just think that babies need something that is for them like in any other disease where they’ve got syrups,” says Motsoaledi.
