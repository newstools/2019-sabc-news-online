A mayor of one of the municipalities is expected to appear on murder related charges after he was arrested on Friday. There is a handful of supporters carrying placards bearing the name of the mayor- who is expected to appear in court. Some placards have the slogan “hands off our mayor”. On the other hand, there are those supporting the ANC Youth League in the region. The local Youth League is calling for justice for their slain deputy chair, Wandile Ngubeni. Ngubeni was killed in May 2016. ANC members dressed in party colours are pouring into the court precinct, singing struggle songs. Related Video
