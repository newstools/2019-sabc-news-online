Eskom says they don’t expect any loadshedding on Friday. However, the power grid remains tight. The power utility hasn’t been loadshedding for over a week now. Eskom’s Andrew Etzinger says,”When we assessed the state of the grid yesterday, it was clear that we could possibly be in trouble due to poor plant performance during the course of the week and particularly on Wednesday evening.” He adds: “We noticed that the situation is a little better than we had anticipated. Yesterday there was no loadshedding and if things stay as they are at the moment, we don’t expect loadshedding today.” “Once again the grid is tight and if we pick up unexpected problems we may need to implement loadshedding and we will inform the public.” Related video click below:
