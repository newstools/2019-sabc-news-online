A 31-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping and killing an eight-year-old girl. The murdered girl had gone missing two weeks ago at Mkhuze in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Mayor Solomon Mkhombo says the man also allegedly tried to rape a 10-year-old girl, but was disturbed. The suspect was then apprehended by the community when he attempted to rape an elderly woman who was cleaning at a church. A scuffle broke out when he tried to rape her, but she fought back hitting the assailant with a spade. The assailant managed to poke her eyes and she lost her sight. Mkhombo says, “We are calling upon the law enforcement agents to continue pursuing and investigating the man because we believe that he can shed some light into a number of serious cases which are unresolved.”
