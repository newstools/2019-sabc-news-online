Young ballet dancers will be able to audition this week in Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg to participate later the 2019 in the American Academy of Ballet’s 26th Summer School of Excellence. A former director of the University of Cape Town’s ballet school, Mignon Furman, founded the American Academy before she immigrated to New York. Each year, about 30 dancers from across South Africa are selected to attend the Summer School. Many are awarded with scholarships to attend the eight week programme run, on two campuses, in New York. Dancers must have a minimum of two years’ training. The Cape Town audition, for dancers from ages 11 and older, takes place from Monday 4 March, at Jan van Riebeeck Primary school, followed by auditions in Pretoria and Johannesburg.
