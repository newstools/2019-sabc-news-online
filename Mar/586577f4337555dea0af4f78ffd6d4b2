The first witness in the Timothy Omotoso trial, Cheryl Zondi, will have to testify afresh about her sexual ordeals with the Nigerian pastor in the church house and other venues. The case has been postponed to 30th July in the Port Elizabeth High Court after judge Mandela Makaula recused himself. Zondi testified and underwent grueling cross examination for a week. It was after she was excused, that the defence complained about the judge being biased towards her. NPA Spokesperson, Tsepo Ndwalaza says the state witnesses will be notified about the new developments. “This case is going to start de-novo – it is going start from scratch. It is like it never happened. But we are going to go ahead with it. And you heard it is going to take two months. That is the time within it should be done and dealt with. So, we are positive as we start we are going to deal with this issue and finish it,” says Ndwalaza. Watch video below for more on the story:
