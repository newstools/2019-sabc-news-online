The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has sent its heartfelt condolences to the families of the 157 people who lost their lives when the Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 crashed. For the second time in less than six months, a brand-new Boeing aircraft has crashed minutes into a flight. “The aviation industry must be held accountable. Profit should never come before people. May the departed souls rest in peace,” the party says in a statement. Meanwhile, Kenya says it is sending senior government officials to Ethiopia to assist with logistics and investigations. President Cyril Ramaphosa says South African diplomatic missions in Addis Ababa and Nairobi have been directed to work with Ethiopian Airlines to ascertain whether there were any South Africans on board the plane. Ramaphosa has also sent a message of condolences to the affected families. There were passengers from at least 35 nationalities aboard the ill-fated flight. The plane crashed six minutes after take-off.
