Judgment has been reserved in anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol’s case. Former apartheid police officer Joao Rodrigues has made an application in the High Court in Johannesburg for a permanent stay of prosecution for his alleged involvement in the killing of Timol. The High Court heard arguments on Thursday and Friday from the defence team of Rodrigues and different parties with interest in the case. Timol was murdered in 1971 during police detention. The full bench of the High Court heard arguments from all parties. This includes Joao Rodrigues’ defence and parties that came as friends of the court. All those who have an interest in the matter have presented that the former police officer should be prosecuted at all costs. Truth and Reconciliation Commission Senior Counsel Alan Dodson told the court that a permanent stay of prosecution in this case will also be a stay for all former security branch officers implicated in crimes against humanity. Advocates for South African Litigation Centres Advocate Bonita Meyersfeld told the court that if there’s no prosecution in the matter, then it will mean that all apartheid victims in this country will have nowhere else to go. Judgement has been reserved.
