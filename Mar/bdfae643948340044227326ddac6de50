The 23rd edition of South Africa’s National Science Festival is underway in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape under the theme “Discover your element.” The festival celebrates the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements as proclaimed by the United Nations. The science festival is aimed at providing a platform to students across the country by facilitating learning in an informal way and providing learners with a great opportunity to discover science outside the classroom.

The festival is expected to attract thousands of budding young scientists. The theme “Discover your element” puts the spotlight on the importance of the planet’s natural resources. From fossil fuels to molecules, bio diversity and animals, the 54 Exhibitions and 40 workshops caters for all science fanatics. The Sci-fest also provides career guidance for the youth. The visitors are lapping up the experience. “I want to be a dentist so this will help me a lot in choosing what I need.” “The science festival has been great, I enjoyed the stalls and my favourite was water world.” “I enjoyed the Festival and learnt so much we visited the gold store.” Educators are also encouraged to take science education out of the classroom.
