DA leader Mmusi Maimane says he has written to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, to request President Cyril Ramaphosa to be subpoenaed to appear before the Commission before the 8 May elections. Maimane says the President must account for his family’s links to Bosasa.  Former Bosasa auditor, Peet Venter, testified under oath that President Ramaphosa’s son, Andile Ramaphosa, received money from Bosasa. Earlier on Wednesday, the President’s son admitted receiving over R2 million from Bosasa. This is in addition to an amount that was donated to Ramaphosa’s campaign for ANC president. Maimane says the President must explain the full extent of the business relationship between himself, his family and Bosasa.
