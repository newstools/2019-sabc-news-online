Three suspects are expected to appear at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday for dealing in rhino horns as well as contravening the endangered species regulations. The three suspects were arrested during a three day operation targeting the trafficking of rhino horns. The arrests were made on Saturday in Randburg where the team managed to seize five rhino horns, 14 pieces of abalone, three seahorses, two sea cucumbers, vehicles and weighing and processing equipment worth a substantial amount was seized. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Muladzi says, “It was a joint effort between ourselves as the Hawks, tracker and other entities. These people we have been tracking them for a while and on Saturday it was at the culmination of that investigation where we managed to arrest three suspects. There were rhino horns and other endangered species that were also confiscated. There are also possibilities that we could add more charges.”
