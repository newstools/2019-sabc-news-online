Mamelodi’s most-wanted man Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela will spend a second night in police custody.
This is after he made his court appearance in the Pretoria Magistrate’s court on Thursday. Mathibela handed himself to police on Wednesday evening after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Dubbed the ‘number one tsotsi’ in Mamelodi, looking skinny and youthful; he lacks the looks of a hardened criminal. Mathibela made his first appearance in a packed courtroom with heavily armed police. He is alleged to be a ring leader of a group terrorizing Mamelodi. He is also known to own multiple mini bus taxis and a Pretoria night club. Mathibela’s legal team first argued against the presence of the heavily armed police; saying this was an infringement of their client’s rights to a fair trial. The court ruled that police were there to ensure safety. Mathibela’s legal team also filed an application, arguing that his arrest was illegal and that he should be released, but again the court ruled against this. Following the failed application by Mathibela’s legal team to have the court declare his arrest illegal, the matter has now been postponed to Friday for a formal bail application. Two of Mathibela’s alleged accomplices have also been arrested. They appeared in court this week on charges of extortion, intimidation and assault. He will now join the two in the bail application on Friday. Mathibela’s arrest has been praised and welcomed by both Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Police Minister Bheki Cele.
