African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says coalition governments don’t work in South Africa, as people say they do. He says instead they are a huge impediment to development and governance; and are a huge frustration. Ramaphosa says if the ANC will win the May 8 elections with an outright majority, his party will not venture into any coalition. He was speaking in Germiston east of Johannesburg on Tuesday night during a dialogue with the Hellenic community of South Africa. Ramaphosa says the ANC is the way to go after the elections.
