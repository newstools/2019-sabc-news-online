The Commission of Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) continues in Pretoria on Monday. Last week, the PIC probe heard that then Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dan Matjila insisted on being given all the IT systems admin passwords for the entire organisation. This came amid attempts to electronically track down a whistleblower who had made allegations of wrongdoing against Matjila. The PIC Commission has heard that Matjila’s actions were a breach of IT governance rules and exposed the corporation’s IT system to external risks. The inquiry is probing allegations of impropriety at Africa’s largest asset manager. Watch a related video below:
