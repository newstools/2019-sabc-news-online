KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Sihle Zikalala says a lot has been achieved to integrate blacks into the mainstream economy but women and the youth remain marginalised. He was speaking at the opening of the Radical Economic Transformation Summit in Durban. The summit has brought together various organisations including those from the business sector and government. Zikalala says KwaZulu-Natal’s economy needs to be inclusive. “Today’s summit seeks to ensure that we undertake an evaluation and assess how far we’ve gone to transform the economy of the country. From here, we’ll be able to also emerge with a clear way forward which will talk to a programme that must be engaged. This summit brings together government, various stakeholders including the private sector. We want to ensure that all people are given platforms to engage, have access to opportunities.”
