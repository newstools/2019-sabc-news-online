Cyber crime remains a thorny issue for South Africa and the world, and this situation has compelled governments to embark on a massive training campaign to acquire relevant skills in the IT space. Among other things,  cyber crime tempers with companies’ intellectual property, as well as individuals’ confidential data. Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says despite the cyber crime challenge, there are plenty of opportunities for South Africans in the digital space as the fourth industrial revolution sets in. Ndabeni-Abrahams delivered a keynote address at the Cyber-law workshop in Pretoria. Cyber crime is reportedly costing the country about R2 billion a year. She says, “The only thing that South Africa has not managed to do is to co-ordinate its effort, which is why through the 4IR communication that the President has appointed we are seeking to achieve this. We are working with all sectors to say tell us what is it that you’ve done in order for South Africa to derive an economic spin-off from this Fourth Industrial Revolution.” “In terms of skills we are also enhancing the skills. We do have qualified people, but there are certain skills that we don’t have, which is why we launched a campaign of training a million data scientists.” Watch related video below:
