The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) says the situation regarding its strike now lies in the hands of mine management to accept the agreement proposed. Amcu has been on strike at Sibanye-Stillwater’s gold operations since November last year in a wage dispute. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant ordered the Commission of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to settle the dispute. The union says it has received a mandate from its members to accept the settlement agreement proposed by the CCMA. The agreement is meant to end the wage deadlock with Sibanye Stillwater that saw thousands of members affiliated to the union embarking on a four month protracted strike action. In explaining the terms of settlement, AMCU President Joseph Mathunjwa says: “They came back proposing R5 700 as a cash payment to our members with other benefits that the employer agreed on. Since we’ve been on strike; we’ve been in arrears in terms of medical aid and other benefits that were not paid. The company said yes they will take those payments and our members are responsible. They want to end the strike so the ball is in the court of the employer.”
