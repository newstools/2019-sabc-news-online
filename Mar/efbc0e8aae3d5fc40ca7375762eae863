The Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation will be conducting workshops on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cape Town from Friday until Sunday. The girls-only bootcamp aims to provide access to information and technology. One of the workshops will be taking place in Woodstock on Friday and in Mitchells Plain on Sunday with former President, Kgalema Motlanthe, addressing the youth. “This weekend we are in Mitchells Plain and the focus is on girls because information technology is a universal human right. Through the girls only bootcamp, we’re are attempting to address the systematic exclusion of youth in various 21st century careers. We feel that through the bootcamp, we can encourage a mindset change, we can bring about news skills in entrepreneurship and innovation and problem solving things that will go along way towards the development of the girls and their future careers,” says Lee Chana, Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation.
