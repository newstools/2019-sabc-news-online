Editor and Publisher of SA Flyer Magazine Guy Leitch, says Comair showed good leadership in deciding to ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 following the Ethiopia Airline crash. The Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 plunged into a field minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa for Nairobi on Sunday. As a safety precaution, the Airline ground their Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet until further notice. China followed suit, as did Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, Mongolia, Aeromexico, our own Comair as well as GOL a Brazilian airline, with many countries doing the same. Speaking on Morning Live, Leitch says had Comair not decided to ground these planes and something happened, it would have bankrupted the airline. He also says it was a good decision to ground the aircraft themselves instead of being forced by the Civil Aviation Authority. For more watch below  According to Leitch, the Boeing 737 Max 8 is a relatively safe plane being used by many airlines around the world. However, the latest crash comes five months after a jet of the same model came down in Indonesia, killing 189 people and prompted a global aviation safety scare. Leitch says the Indonesia crash was not properly dealt with by the manufacturer that is why the grounding of these planes is important until more information is available on the causes.
