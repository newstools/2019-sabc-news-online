Zimbabweans in South Africa have called for relief assistance to help victims of cyclone Idai with any sort of donation. Authorities say 31 people have died in Zimbabwe and about 70 people are missing as a result of tropical cyclone which earlier inflicted severe damage in Mozambique.   Relief Coordinator, Kennedy Mandaza says good Samaritans could also contact their embassy in South Africa to make donations. ” Bridges, telecommunications, houses, schools, hospitals have been destroyed. And we’re therefore calling upon for assistance for our brothers and sisters from SA and those from the Zimbabwean community to come together to collect or bring forward their donations. The embassy would also participate in coordinating these efforts.”   Earlier International Relations Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu has appealed to South African NGOs, companies and individuals to make donations for flood relief to neighbouring countries affected by tropical cyclone Idai. Well over 100 people have lost their lives in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe as a results of floods. More than 400 000 people have been displaced and are in urgent need of shelter. Those who want to make donations are urged to contact the department’s Surprise Malehase on 081 037 2765. Department spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mabaya says, “Minister Lindiwe Sisulu received briefing this morning from the Ambassadors in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe when it comes to the impact caused by the cyclone. Following the briefing the minister indicated that what is a priority now is humanitarian aid. This will include food, clothes, medicine, and also stationary for children who go to school.”
