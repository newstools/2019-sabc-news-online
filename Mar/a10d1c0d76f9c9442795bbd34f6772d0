Deputy President David Mabuza will on Tuesday answer oral questions in the National Assembly. This is his last appearance in the House before Parliament rises for the May eighth general elections. The Deputy President will face questions ranging from electricity supply challenges as well as expropriation of land without compensation. Parliament is currently sourcing public views after it passed a resolution to expropriate land without compensation last year. Members of parliament want to know how land reform will be implemented so that it doesnâ€™t impact negatively the agricultural sector and the entire economy. Some want to know if government knows the root causes of the current electricity supply challenges. This follows the latest load shedding experienced last month. As the chairperson of the SA National Aids Council, Mabuza will also be quizzed on progress made in combating HIV/Aids.
