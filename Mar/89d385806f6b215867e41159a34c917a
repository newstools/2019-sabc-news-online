The Anglican Church has come out in support of the ‘Justice4Vernie Movement’ that has been launched in Cape Town. The movement was launched at St George’s Cathedral to honour the late Director-General of Correctional Services, Vernie Petersen, who died after a short illness in 2011. Petersen’s name came up during the Zondo Commission into State Capture as having refused to be bribed into extending Bosasa tenders. Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba says, “It is my great privilege today to support the campaign ‘Justice4Vernie’. It is therefore with a scene of pride that we celebrate how Vernie went on after the advent of democracy to become an equally dedicated public servant. Indeed by all accounts a model public servant.” Former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel also spoke at the launch of the ‘Justice4Vernie’ Movement. Manuel says corruption is rife because the leadership of the country has stopped asking questions.  Manuel says things have gone wrong in recent years. He adds, “I was once in conversation with [former president] Jacob Zuma and I said to him, in 15 years not once have I adjudicated a tender. It’s not a place for a minister to adjudicate a tender, there are processes set out in law for that, and I thought he would says to me , oh lets take this forward, and his response was he he he.. I think as a nation we have allowed it to continue for so long.”
