Trains between Tembisa and Pretoria are running an hour late on Wednesday morning following Tuesday’s train accident at the Elandsfontein station near Germiston. Thirteen people were injured when two coaches derailed. Metrorail spokesperson Lilian Mofokeng says the cause of the accident hasn’t been determined yet. “The clearing of the accident scene has been done, however, we still can’t check on what could have necessarily happened because now its peak period we have to take people to work hence we are announcing a 60-minutes train delay to be anticipated.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/664999">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
