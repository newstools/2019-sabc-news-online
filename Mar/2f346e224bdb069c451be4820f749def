Three grade eight learners have been suspended from a Soweto high school over the alleged rape of a fellow learner. The alleged rape happened while the learners from the school were attending an orientation camp in De Deur in the Vaal at the weekend. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona says the three learners are suspended pending a disciplinary hearing against them. “We are quite aware that the process of investigation is being done because while we were at the school the police also arrived to do their work. Our understanding is that last night the SGB had to urgently meet so that they process the suspensions of all these implicated learners. Three of them are now suspended and their disciplinary process will be undertaken on the 13th of this month.”
