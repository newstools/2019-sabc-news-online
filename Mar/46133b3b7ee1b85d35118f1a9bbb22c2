Former Police and Sports Minister, Fikile Mbalula, has confirmed his 2011 emotional outburst regarding the Gupta family’s influence on the ANC leadership and former President Jacob Zuma. Mbalula is testifying before the State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Parktown in Johannesburg. Former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and former Communications Minister Sphiwe Nyanda both testified that Mbalula raised his concerns about the Gupta family after Ajay Gupta called him to congratulate him on his appointment as Sport Minister in 2011. The call was made before he was notified formally by Zuma. Mbalula says he spoke out because he believes the Guptas had more privileges than ANC members. “I took that matter to the NEC to share part of my experience, to say to the NEC that this thing of the Guptas of interfering and calling ministers is a big problem. One day this thing will land us in a big problem. I said these people enjoy the powers that not even the members of the ANC enjoy.” Click on video below:
