International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has met with Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi to discuss further ways in which South Africa can continue to provide support in the wake of Cyclone Idai. Their meeting, which took place in Mozambique on Friday, comes as the South African National Defence Force deploys more members to Beira.  South Africa has called on its citizens to assist the three countries affected by the cyclone – Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Sisulu says she held extensive discussions with Nyusi. “He briefed me that he himself has been to Beira. He indicated what the situation was when he was there and what efforts have been put in there, very grateful for the support the South Africans have provided. He’s very grateful also for the support that has been provided by other countries and we’re hoping that very soon we’ll be able to get beyond the situation we are in now.” The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) executive director Henrietta Fore has commended South Africa for the assistance it’s giving the affected countries, particularly Mozambique. “ South Africa has been extremely strong, sending help from the government to this government because the planes that have been able to help in Beira have been crucial for their assistance. So, all of us will have to find ways of bringing in enough supplies to help thousands in Beira.” United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Gutteres has called for greater international support to the southern African region. In a statement read by his deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq, Gutteres, says the UN and its agencies plan to continue scaling up their response. Related Videos:
