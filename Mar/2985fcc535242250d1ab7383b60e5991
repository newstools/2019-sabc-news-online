Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele has apologised after forensic teams took more than four hours to remove the body of the 19-year-old Mondeor High School learner who was stabbed to death. Makhubele was speaking at the funeral service of Kulani Mathebula who was stabbed to death while on the way to school. Kulani is being laid to rest at Xikundu village near Malamulele in Limpopo. His family had criticised the Health Department for taking four hours to collect Mathebulaâ€™s body from the scene. Makhubele says police have done their part by arresting suspects but the rest is in the hands of the justice department.
