The Western Cape Local Government Department has welcomed the early winter rainfall which has been falling since the weekend. It says the much needed rain has assisted in drought stricken areas like the Karoo. The Gouritz River catchment area, which covers the bulk of the region, has seen an increase in dam levels for the first time this year. The average level stands at just over 19%. “Some very welcome early winter rain has fallen over large parts of the Western Cape including the Karoo Region. The Gouritz River Catchment area which covers the bulk of the Karoo region has seen an increase in average dam levels for the first time this year. That’s  quite exciting, but of course it’s still along way to go for the regions which remains severely affected by this ongoing drought which has affected across the province for the bulk of the past four years . The average levels for dams across the province stands at 39.8%,” says the department’s James-Brent Styan. Meanwhile, dams that supply Cape Town are standing at more than 52%. Water restrictions in the city remain at level Three. Residents are allowed 105-liters per person per day. The watering of gardens is now allowed using water efficient methods.
