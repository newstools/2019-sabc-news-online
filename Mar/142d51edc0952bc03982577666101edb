Rainy weather has forced the cancellation of some flights between East London and Johannesburg. It’s believed that Fly Safair has cancelled its flights from the East London airport. Severe thunderstorms have been experienced over the weekend. South African Weather Services has cautioned of severe thunderstorms with hail over the extreme eastern parts of the province in the next coming days. SA Weather Service’s Garth Sampson has urged people to exercise caution. “When this occurs people must stay away from low lying areas. When lighting occurs they must not stay under trees because that is one of the biggest causes of deaths. Stay away from metallic structures but the best thing of all is to stay indoors as far as possible. If traveling, stay away from low-lying drifts and if you are caught in the hail storm try to park underneath the bridge,” says Sampson.
