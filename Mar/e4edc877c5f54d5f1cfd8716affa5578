The University of Cape Town will on Monday launch its Cape Town Drought Response Learning Initiative and Film Library, which documents the many lessons learned from the water crisis over the past couple of years. It is a collaboration between UCT’s African Climate and Development Initiative, Cine South and Conversations that Count. Director of Conversations that Count, Peter Willis, says their efforts will ultimately culminate in a 90-minute documentary film. “The final phase is we’ll be making a full-length documentary that tells the story of the water crisis and brings what it felt like heading towards day zero and again ends with the key lessons we learnt out of it.”
