There were tears of joy at Kamieskroon in the Northern Cape on Saturday as non-profit organisation Water Warriors donated more than 15 000 litres of water. The town is severely distressed and residents only have access to water for two hours a day.  For the past six months residents had barely enough water. For farmers like Poeloe Hanekom, it has been an emotional rollercoaster, but help came rolling in. More water will arrive over the next few days to assist the parched town. Oudtshoorn, another drought stricken area, is next on the list for Water Warriors.  While the water donations are welcomed by communities like Kamieskroon, they are hoping for rain toÂ  break the drought. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
