The Mamelodi businessman dubbed No.: 1 Tsotsi, Vusi Reginald “Khekhe” Mathibela will challenge his arrest in the High Court after being accused of being among those terrorising the community. This was announced by his lawyer Solomon Mkhabela during the bail application proceedings in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. The bail application of his two co-accused, Elias Skhosana and Stemmer Monageng, was postponed to next week Monday. Prosecutor  Lizo Tshomela wanted the accused to remain in custody until April, but this was opposed by defence lawyers.  The case stood down until Monday for Skhosana and Monareng’s bail hearing. Mkhabela elaborates, “In a nutshell, as of now, accused No.: 3 is not going to be launching the bail application. It would be only in respect of accused No.: 1 and 2. Accused No.: 3 is challenging the validity of his arrest in that it was devoid of any legality. All the interested parties will be served through emails over the weekend and by Monday, we would have obtained a date for the hearing on this urgent application in the High Court.”
