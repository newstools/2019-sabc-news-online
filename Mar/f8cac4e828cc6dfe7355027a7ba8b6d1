The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will continue to hear Eskom-related testimony from former business rescue practitioner of Optimum coal mine, Piers Marsden and former Mineral Resources Department Director-General, Dr Thibedi Ramontja in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday morning. The Commission will also hear testimony of former Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene. On Wednesday, Marsden said Eskom representatives did not seem interested in finalising an agreement to avoid putting Optimum Coal Mine into liquidation when the mine was still owned by Glencore. Marsden expressed his shock at a letter sent to Ramontja by former Eskom Executive Matshela Koko requesting his intervention in Optimum’s business rescue process. Marsden said he found this to be strange because Glencore had agreed to all of Eskom’s demands days before Koko sent the letter. Judge Ramond Zondo is also expected to rule on ANC MP Des Van Rooyen’s application for leave to cross examine former Director General at National Treasury, Lungisa Fuzile.
