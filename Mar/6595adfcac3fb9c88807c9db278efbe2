The African National Congress (ANC) says it has yet to establish what its high-profile party member will be charged with following his arrest in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. The arrest of the mayor is part of the on-going investigation into political killings in the province. He has been in office for barely two months. Earlier this week, ANC mayor in the Harry Gwala District, Mluleki Ndobe, appeared in the uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court on a murder charge, relating to the killing of former ANC Youth League Secretary-General, Sindiso Magaqa. “At this point, we are unable to confirm whether the mayor has been picked up for questioning or has been charged with anything. The leadership of the ANC is engaging with the comrades in that area and trying to establish what is happening and as soon as we’ve been able to get the proper details we will be able to issue a proper statement,” says KZN ANC Spokesperson Noma Zulu.
