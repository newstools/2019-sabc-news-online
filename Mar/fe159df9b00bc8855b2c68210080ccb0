The ANC in Gauteng has welcomed the closure of six taxi ranks and routes in Soweto. Roads and Transport MEC, Ismail Vadi, ordered the closure of ranks and routes on Friday following ongoing violence between rival associations, NANDUWE and WATA. Fifteen taxi operators were arrested and their taxis impounded on Friday when they defied the order and operated on closed routes. Provincial ANC spokesperson, Tasneem Motara, says the safety of commuters comes first. Motara says the ANC sees the closure of taxi ranks in Gauteng as a progressive way in which to resolve the taxi violence in the affected area. “We think that the MEC together with all the stakeholders are taking the right steps towards resolving the problem. We want it resolved sooner rather than later in the interest of the commuters as opposed to other stakeholders because public transport is the backbone of our economy.” Related Video
