Charges against KwaZulu-Natal mayor Mluleki Ndobe in connection with the murder of former ANC Youth leader Sindiso Magaqa‘s have been withdrawn. Ndobe appeared in the Umzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court last Tuesday in connection with the murder. The Harry Gwala District Municipality mayor and KwaZulu-Natal ANC heavyweight has been in police custody along with four other accused after they were arrested over the weekend. Ndobe has welcomed the news. Meanwhile, the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal is calling for specialised courts to deal with political related cases in the province. Two ANC mayors are currently facing charges ranging from murder to conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the killing of ANC members and leaders. Speaking outside the Emadadeni Magistrate’s Court in northern KwaZulu-Natal, provincial spokesperson of the ANC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, said they understand the court rolls are full. She says specialised courts will be able to deal with such cases more speedily. “We would like to appreciate the work that has been done by the inter-ministerial committee. Because if you remember, we have been the loudest voice for the past two years to say there are no arrests being done even though there are so many people being killed, so when there is progress we appreciate that. However on the same name we need to also call for specialised courts to deal with these matters because such matters are matters you need to deal with quickly because if you don’t do that they linger on for too long and understanding how congested our the role of our courts are this might end up being a matter that drags for longer that it is supposed.” Watch related video below:
