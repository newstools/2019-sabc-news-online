Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says South African Aviation experts will offer their assistance to their Ethiopian counterparts in getting to the bottom of the plane crash that killed 157 people. This as investigators continue their probe into a brand-new passenger jet that crashed outside Addis Ababa at the weekend, killing all 157 people on board. Aviation authorities are investigating what could have led to the crash after the flight recorders were recovered. Transport ministry spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi says:”South Africa through the task team comprising of all relevant staff entities and agencies such as the South African civil aviation authorities, the air traffic navigation and services and the South African search and rescue will collaborate with the Ethiopian counterparts to offer any necessary assistance.” The minister says they want to ensure the speedy conclusion of the investigation into the crash.  The Nairobi-bound plane smashed into a field just six minutes after takeoff as the pilot alerted controllers of difficulties. Amongst those killed were UN staff and officials heading to Nairobi for a UN Environment Conference.  Airlines in Ethiopia, China and Indonesia have grounded jets of Boeing 737 MAX -8.
