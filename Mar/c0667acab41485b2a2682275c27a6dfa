Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Gwen Ramakgopa, has expressed shock at the gruesome attack of a patient at the Doctor Yusuf Dadoo hospital, west of Johannesburg. It is alleged that the patient had been involved in a fight at Munsieville on the West Rand. He was then transported to hospital in an ambulance. A group of people followed him to the hospital and dragged him out of the ambulance and brutally stoned him. The attack happened around 7:30am Sunday morning. Ramakgopa says after the attack the patient was transferred to another hospital for further medical care and safety. “Our hospitals cannot be war-zones. If there’s been fights outside, fights can’t continue in our hospitals. Our security was completely taken by surprise but fortunately the police were on the scene. We’ve also closed the casualty because it’s now a crime scene.”
