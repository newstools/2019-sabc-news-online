The First Lady of South Africa, Dr Tshepo Motsepe, will address the Africa-Asia Partnerships in Health and Healthcare Delivery for Women & Youth Conference at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The conference will be held from 19 to 20 March 2019 and will feature discussions between distinguished experts and recognised practitioners from universities from Africa, Asia and the United States. According  to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly half of the world’s population is under age 25. More than one-third falls between ages 10-19, considered the period of adolescence. The WHO further reports that among adolescent girls aged 15-19 globally, complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death. This conference will focus on Africa-Asia collaboration in sexual and reproductive health, the double burden of undernutrition and overnutrition, infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases including mental health. Delegates will also engage on vaccine development, strengthening private-public partnerships in health, and better academic collaboration in research and education underscored by multisectoral approaches to health and healthcare delivery. Dr Motsepe is the Chairperson of the African Self Help Trust which focuses on Early Childhood Development and Education. She is also Patron of the South African Civil Society for Women’s, Adolescents’ and Children’s Health.
