Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe has encouraged learners from rural schools to study Maths, Science and Technology. Radebe addressed learners from different schools during the School Energy day at the Portia Shabangu high school in Tekwane North, outside of Mbombela in Mpumalanga. The day targets learners from grade 10 to 12, and encourages them to study Maths and Science. Radebe says bursaries are available and those studying the subjects will be able to make a positive contribution to the development of the country and the continent. “We also give a lot of information about the whole energy spectrum so that the ambitions of our children must also include what we call Stem subjects Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics so that they can be able to see that the word is very open space for them to venture into,” says Radebe.
