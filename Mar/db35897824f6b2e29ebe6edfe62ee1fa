The Mpumalanga Health Department has called on residents and businesses to follow proper procedures when using chemicals after 37 people were admitted to hospital after inhaling a chemical that was used to clean a blocked drainage system in a butchery in Kabokweni, outside Mbombela. It is alleged that among the chemicals that were used to unblock the drainage system is HTH-chlorine which is normally used to clean swimming pools. Health Spokesperson, Dumisani Malamule says most of those admitted to hospital are employed by the butchery and two of them are pregnant. “The 37 patients were observed, of which two of them(sic), were females who are pregnant. We took a decision to admit them. We have discharged them after we checked them and realised that they are in a satisfactory condition. 24 of these people were apparently taken by a group of people who came to the hospital to a private hospital in Nelspruit. We want it urge the public to make sure that they follow instructions.” Meanwhile, the Chief Environmental Practitioner for the Ehlanzeni District Municipality, Siyanda Nkosi, says the butchery will remain closed until they are satisfied that it is safe for workers to return to. “The management, I was told, that they tried to unblock the drain using the chemical HTH and the other chemical that is correct for unblocking the drain, but the problem was that they used the chemicals while the people where in the butchery were working and the customers were there. They didn’t provide the food handlers or staff with appropriate clothing.”
