Eskom has warned of possible loadshedding on Tuesday evening which could negatively affect peak hour traffic. The cash strapped energy utility warned of a high risk of Stage 1Â  loadshedding from 4pm to 11 pm due to the loss of generating units at power stations.   The utility has advised customers to check the loadshedding schedule on their website and on their municipality websites.
