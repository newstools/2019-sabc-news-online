President Cyril Ramaphosa says government will continue to work hard to ensure sustainable land reform in South Africa. He was speaking in Ebenhaeser, on the Cape West Coast, where he handed over title deeds to more than 50 households to direct descendants of the Griqua Community. Ramaphosa says the title deeds are for nearly 400 hectares of commercial farmland. “It is a priority of this government to ensure that we provide the necessary support to communities who have had their land returned to them in order for it to be utilised productively and effectively and to support our broader goals of economic transformation. I’m, therefore, particularly pleased that the Ebenhaeser community wants to use the land for productive purposes.”
