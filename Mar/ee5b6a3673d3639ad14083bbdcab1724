Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has described the late African National Congress (ANC) member of the provincial legislature, Rosina Mogiotlane, as an ethical leader. Mathabatha was speaking during the funeral service of Mogotlane in Lephalale. Premier Mathabatha says Mogotlane did not use the public funds meant for service delivery for her own gain during her tenure as the executive mayor in the Waterberg District Municipality. In the past few years, several municipalities in the province have spent service delivery funds by investing in VBS Mutual Bank. “She knew that public resources were there to serve the public and nothing else. As Executive Mayor of the Waterberg District Municipality she ensured that there’s no irregular expenditure. She was an ethical leader who did not compromise on issues of clean and good governance,” says Mathabatha.
