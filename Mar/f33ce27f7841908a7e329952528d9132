Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says the Matsila Arts and Craft Centre is an example of economic development in rural areas. He says government will assist small businesses to venture into big markets. Gordhan officiated at the opening of the centre in Matsile Village in Limpopo. The centre is part of the Matsila Development Trust project aimed at alleviating poverty in the rural parts of the province. “If government departments can now connect them to global markets, so in that way we get quality right, price right and get marketing right, you can get this centre growing into a big one. We can now replicate this in other villages around here and pretty soon, we can drive industries, people employed and in a very different way learn. I think it is a very good example of local initiative, innovation of entrepreneurship. The thing that we talk about in Parliament and elsewhere, here people are actually doing it.” Takalani Netshitungulu, who started painting four years ago says the centre has created a platform for her to showcase her work. “I am a painter. I am really glad so that I can paint. I am a woman – a woman of faith because I can create something. It helps my family because when I paint I can sell, so that I can get money for my children can go to school.”
