Amid heavy rain in Durban this past weekend, showers and thundershowers are on Tuesday expected to continue in most parts of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), especially in the Southern part of KwaZulu-Natal. At least three people were killed after Sunday’s storms in Inanda and Amaoti area, north of Durban. KwaZulu-Natal Cooperative Governance spokesperson Lennox Mabaso says there are two bodies missing at this stage – one of a mother and another teenager from New Hanover in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. The South African Weather Services says the province can expect more light showers and thundershowers on Wednesday. Weather forecaster Wiseman Dlamini says: “Today over KZN, we are still expecting cloudy conditions in most part of the province and there is still going to be some showers and thundershowers in most parts of the province with a good chance mainly in the southern part of KZN. The outlook for Wednesday, we expect some showers and thundershowers mainly in the afternoon over the southern parts of KZN.”
