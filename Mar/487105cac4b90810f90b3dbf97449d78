COPE has lauded former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi as a “brave patriot”, following his testimony at the State Capture Commission. Agrizzi’s evidence at the commission has implicated current and former government officials, Members of Parliament and ANC NEC members. He also conceded that all contracts between government and Bosasa had an element of corruption in them. At the conclusion of his testimony on Friday, Agrizzi also admitted to knowingly participating in corrupt activities at the company in a period lasting over 13 years. COPE spokesperson, Dennies Bloem says more South Africans should take a stand against corruption. “We value his contribution because it is an effort to cleanse this corrupt government. It is also very clear that it was not only Jacob Zuma that was captured by the Guptas and Bosasa but it was the entire ANC, including the present President, Cyril Ramaphosa.” Related video below:
