The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (BEMAWU) says more needs to be done to increase the revenue of the SABC. This after SABC group executive board members appeared before the Communications Committee to give updates on progress made on its turnaround strategy. They say, it will take some time for the public broadcaster to achieve financial stability, despite recent cost-cutting measures. They have, however, assured workers that salaries will be paid at the end of this month. BEMAWU’s Hannes du Buisson says they do not believe that the SABC’s financial situation is merely about costs. He says: “Yes there is a huge cost factor and wastage of money as there is still today. What has been said in Parliament about outside resources that have been used is not entirely correct. We are aware of those things. But the fact of the matter is the revenue of the SABC – there is not enough done to increase the revenue and once you increase revenue, as there is a balance between expenditure and revenue, it will completely change.” Related Video
