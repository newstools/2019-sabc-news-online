The Gauteng Health Department says it has received around 300 new claims from the families of victims of the Life Esidimeni tragedy. According to the committee representing the families only 139 out of 1 400 claimants have been paid. However, the department says the outcomes of the Life Esidimeni Arbitration, led by retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, ordered the government to pay out 134 claims, which have been fully complied with. Gauteng provincial spokesperson Thabo Masebe says they are processing and verifying new claims as they are received. “Justice Moseneke ordered government to pay 134 claimants that order has been fully complied with according to the lists that were provided by Justice Moseneke. Not all the affected families were part of the proceedings and Justice Moseneke did actually say that he expects more people may now start coming forward to make their claim. New claims, we are sitting at about 300 people who have now approached the government and those are being processed with the assistance of the office of the master of the high court.” Click on video below:
