The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it does not rule out the possibility of removing its mayor who has been arrested in connection with the murder of former ANC Youth League Secretary-General, Sindiso Magaqa in 2017. The mayor from a municipality in southern KwaZulu-Natal was arrested on Sunday by the police’s National Task Team investigating political killings in the province. Speaking outside the uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court, Provincial Executive Committee member Ricardo Mthembu says the KwaZulu-Natal ANC leadership is yet to meet to discuss the mayor’s arrest. “We are going to take a stance. This is a serious case. We sympathise with Magaqa family. On the matter that has to do with our leader, we are going to seat down as a province and to pronounce ourselves on the matter. Of course,, there is a possibility.” Click video below for more on the story:
