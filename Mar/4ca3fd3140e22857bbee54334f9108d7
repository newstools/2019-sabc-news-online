Zambia’s High Commissioner in South Africa, Emmanuel Mwamba, has called for an immediate stop to attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa. About 200 foreign nationals fled the informal settlements where they were living in Durban, after being attacked at night. They have accused the police of failing to protect them. The displaced people say they called the Sydenham police station that is only a stone’s throw away from the settlements, but the police officers never arrived. The Zambian High Commission has denounced the attacks. Mwamba says he is raising the alarm because of xenophobic attacks in the past. He has warned that diplomats from African countries are planning an urgent meeting with the South African government to secure assurances that African foreign nationals are safe. Mwamba says it is imperative to act fast to  protect lives and property. Meanwhile a representative of Zambian nationals – Deborah Nkokga – has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to step in and stop the attacks. “I think we must tell the President please stop this. President Cyril Ramaphosa was talking on the news telling people that he doesn’t care who you are and where you come from, but he is going to sort out anyone who come here illegally. Only those must go home. I even have a video of the President saying that. I am sure that because of his words the people just took the President’s words to do these things. The President was talking about ‘illegally’ but these people did not understand English.”  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
