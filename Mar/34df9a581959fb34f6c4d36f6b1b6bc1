Several land claimants and beneficiaries in Gauteng are due to get their land back, while others will receive financial compensation for their dispossessed land. President Cyril Ramaphosa will handover settled and finalised land claims by some residents of Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane at the Presidential Land Handover ceremony in Mamelodi outside Pretoria on Saturday morning. The settled and finalised land claims will be handed over to two families, with other nine claimants receiving financial compensation. Government has spent over R200 million rand in settling and finalising these claims. The beneficiaries lost their land when they were forcefully removed from their properties during the 1913 Natives Land Act. Accompanied by Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, the President will start the handover ceremony by laying a wreath at the Kilnerton Memorial Site. This memorial stone was erected by beneficiaries to honour the dispossessed land of their forefathers.
