Ethiopiaâ€™s parliament has declared Monday, a day of national mourning, after an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed killing all 157 people on board. Flight ET 302 was enroute from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, when it went down near the town of Bishoftu, six minutes after take-off on Sunday. Anxious families say they rushed to the airport in Addis Ababa. The Jomo Kenyatta International was the final destination for ET 302, with at least 32 Kenyans on board. Many of those on board were attending the United Nations Environmental Assembly due to open in Nairobi on Monday. Grief-stricken relatives have been trying to get any information on their loved ones. With little information coming in, social media was their first port of call. Kenya is the worst affected by the crash. The last Ethiopian Airline crash was in 2010 when its flight crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it took off from Beirut. All the 90 people on board died. Click on video below:
