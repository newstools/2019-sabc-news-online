The National Assembly is holding its last sitting of the fifth Parliament on Wednesday. A debate on Human Rights Day is expected to take place and MPs are also expected to bid one another farewell. The National Assembly already dissolved on the 21st of February before the end of its term. However the motion for the dissolution also required the Assembly to pass a resolution that would allow the House to continue with its business and to conclude processing legislation despite its dissolution. On Tuesday, the House passed various pieces of legislation and processed various committee reports. Some of them include the Films and Publications Amendment Bill, the Public Audit Excess Fees Bill and the Public Service Amendment Bill. The Assembly also resolved to officially remove ICASA Chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga from office. It further approved the names of candidates to fill vacancies in the SABC Board and the Commission for Gender Equality. Today, MPs will end their session by bidding one another farewell.
