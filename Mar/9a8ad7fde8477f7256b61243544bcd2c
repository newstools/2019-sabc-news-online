Former Sports Minister Fikile Mbabula denied being inconsistent when he told former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela that it was former President Jacob Zuma who had contacted him about his appointment as minister. In the evidence from the Madonsela, Mbalula only speaks of communication from the former President and the Presidency. But his evidence at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, Mbalula says it was Ajay Gupta who first informed him of his new position. Mbalula sought to clarify what appeared to be a contradiction. “That is the context that I was dealing with in the Public Protector to explain that it is the President who appointed me as Minister of Sports and I was contacted by Lakela Kaunda. “I was not contacted by the Guptas. Inconsistencies that arise from the point of view prior to the call that I was congratulated is not raised in this particular instance.” The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has adjourned until Monday morning. Earlier, former Sports minister said he did not think the revelations coming out of the commission would hurt the ANC at the polls. Mbalula – who’s also the party’s Head of Elections – wrapped up his testimony. Speaking on the sidelines – he said the inquiry would actually work in the party’s favour, “I think that the mere fact that the ANC was brave enough to take a resolution to get this going is important, and lay to rest whatever that came up about the Guptas or anybody who could be implicated in State Capture.”  Click video below:
