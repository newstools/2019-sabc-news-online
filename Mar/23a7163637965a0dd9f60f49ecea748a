Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta has sacked the country’s Sports Minister Rashid Echesa in a mini reshuffle that comes hot on the heels of a renewed fight against corruption. Rashid Echesa has in recent days founds himself in trouble with the law over cases of misconduct. In January a court in Nairobi deported eight belly dancers who entered the country illegally with the help of the minister. The eight, who included seven Pakistanis and one Indian, are believed to have been victims of human trafficking. The minister defended himself saying the eight were in the country to promote trans-national culture. Echesa is also linked to a group of suspects who impersonated President Uhuru Kenyatta and conned a businessman off 800 000 US Dollars under the guise that they would get him a tender. It is not clear yet if his dismissal had anything to do with these cases.
