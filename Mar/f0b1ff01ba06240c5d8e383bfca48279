Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, has implicated ANC MP, Cedric Frolick at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Agrizzi says around 2010 and 2011, Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson handed Frolick a security bag with money in attempts to make then Parliament’s Correctional Services Chairperson, Vincent Smith, sympathetic towards Bosasa Agrizzi says Smith, at the time, held an anti-Bosasa perspective and Watson believed that Frolick had a very good relationship with him. On Thursday, he revealed that he was aware of a R10 million – R12 million donation handed to the top six -presumably the ANC’s top leadership. “There are large donations that I know were given to the top 6 at one stage of R10 million – R12 million. Cheques were taken there and it always appeared it was just taken there because there was a meeting. Once the other people see that company is very proliferate, don’t touch or mess with it. Because if you touch it you might lose your job, that is what is comes down to, that you might lose your power base.”
