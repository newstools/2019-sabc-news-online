Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, says if elected, his party will deal decisively with corruption.  Malema on a campaign trrail in North-West. He claims the VBS bank scandal in the province is just the tip of the iceberg. The provincial government earlier announced that over R2 billion was lost to corruption. Malema  is on a week-long election campaign trail and confident that his party will secure the majority vote in the North West. The red berets on the ground preparing for the fiercely contested May elections hoping to capitalise on the ruling party’s factional battle and divisions but the EFF concedes it will need more than just highlighting the ruling party’s failures.. “The people no longer want the ANC in these rural areas, I can guarantee that once the opposition reorganises itself, reaches out to the people, it will get the best results ever,” says Malema. Malema also took a swipe at the ruling party’s decision to backtrack on recalling mayors implicated in the combined 314 million VBS Mutual bank investments. “People have invested the money through the party’s instructions – you cannot take actions against them because they will expose the party for what it is,” says Malema. The community hopes life will improve after the elections. “I have a tittle deed, but I do not own or leave in the RDP. I just hope after the elections this will change,” says one of the residents. Some of the community members were happy so see Malema in their village, “I am very happy that Malema is here because he is going root out corruption that is here in Vryburg.” Malema will be crisscrossing the province, meeting structures while also campaigning. This is ahead of the party’s provincial manifesto in Rustenburg at the end of the month.  Watch related video below for more on the story:
