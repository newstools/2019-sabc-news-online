A woman is still missing after heavy rains in Amaoti, Durban North. Search efforts were halted on Tuesday afternoon, but so far two bodies were recovered in different areas north of Durban. The bodies of a man and a child, believed to be his daughter, were found in the river of Amaoti late on Monday. The mother, believed to have drowned, is still missing. The aftermath of Sunday’s heavy rains left many families still trying to come to terms with the nightmare and destruction. Amaoti Councillor Bongani Qhantsi says: “On Sunday around 8pm, the family called other community members for assistance. When they arrived at the scene the house had already been swept away. We searched for them among the rubble but we only managed to find the father and the daughter and not the mother.” A 12-year old child from New Hanover, near Pietermaritzburg, believed to have been washed away during the storm, is also still missing. Lennox Mabaso, from the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, says: “We appeal to people not to settle in areas that will cause danger in the future and to heed our call when we advise them that the areas where they are putting their shacks in, are dangerous.” Watch related videos below for more on the story:
