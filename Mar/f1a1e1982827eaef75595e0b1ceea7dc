The Mozambican city of Beira is making progress in restoration efforts after the devastating Cyclone Idai ravaged the city on March 14 whereby 90% of the downtown area was damaged. Workers are repairing buildings and clearing uprooted trees, which were blocking roads.  Power supply for hospitals and other public services has been restored and communication in the downtown area is generally back to normal. Possible outbreaks of cholera and malaria are still major concerns after the cyclone. To help with restoration efforts, Chinese rescue teams participated in disinfecting some downtown areas following the team’s arrival in Beira on Monday. The rescue teams also held training sessions for residents to prevent epidemic outbreaks. “We want to kill pathogens and prevent transmission through disinfection. We also want to let local people know how to avoid infection from pathogens, and how to avoid infecting family and friends after getting infected,” said Cheng Qinghao, a Chinese anesthetist of the rescue team. Search and rescue operations are still underway in the city. The full impact on Mozambique, where the death toll stands at 446, with over 109 000 displaced, is expected to increase because of widespread destruction to farmland and fisheries. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday, the cyclone has killed at least 446 in Mozambique, with over 109 000 displaced. The cyclone has caused widespread destruction in Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Mozambique, all neighboring countries.
