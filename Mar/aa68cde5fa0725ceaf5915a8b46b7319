As the rolling blackouts continue, law enforcement officials have been put on high alert for any opportunistic criminal activities as a result of criminals taking advantage of the power outages. The City of Johannesburg says metro police officers have been deployed at busy intersection to curb potential smash and grab incidents and also help ease traffic jams. Motorists are urged to be more vigilant and ensure their valuables such as bags and cell phones are kept out of sight. Johannesburg Public Safety MMC Michael Sun.“We have been deploying between 180 to 220 metro police officers and pointsmen to ensure that traffic free flows and more importantly, our regional crime prevention unit within JMPD have been increasing their visibility and patrols to ensure that we don’t have opportunistic crimes such as smash and grabs; as you can imagine, when the intersections are congested the smash and grabbers tend to do their criminal business.”
