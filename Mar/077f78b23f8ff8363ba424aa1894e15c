The National Youth Development Agency ( NYDA ) has commended Higher Education Minister, Naledi Pandor, for allocating close to a billion rand to the students’ historical debt. The NYDA says this will go a long way in providing relief to those who have been unable to register due to historical debt.   The issue has been one of the causes of protests at different universities. In a statement, Pandor announced that an additional R967 million had been set aside to settle historic debt owed by over 52 000 NSFAS-funded continuing students. “The announcement that over 52 000 students will be able to register this year, and have their debt paid by the department is highly welcomed news and the NYDA would like to commend the Minister of Higher Education for taking such a bold step. We think it’s a step in the right direction and we think that a lot of students. Indeed 52 000  of them will be able to get much-needed education so that they’re able to change their lives for the better,” says NYDA Chairperson, Sifiso Mtsweni.
