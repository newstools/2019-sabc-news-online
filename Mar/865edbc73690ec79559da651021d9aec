Academic activities remain suspended at all campuses at the Tshwane University of Technology. Students have been on strike since Monday over the allocation of a meal allowance subsidy. They say the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is only subsidising students staying at university residence with meal allowances whilst those staying outside campus aren’t subsidised. Student Representative Council at the Soshanguve campus says the shutdown is a noble cause to ensure that all students are nourished and have a decent shelter. An IT Software Development student at TUT, Mpho Nyambeni, says although he qualifies for NSFAS funding and a meal allowance, he still hasn’t received funding. “They promised in January, February, now it’s March. We haven’t received anything. Even the landlord; they are kicking us out now because they are expecting money and our parents, they don’t work, receiving grant money. So, there’s nothing we can do. We just have to chill at home and starve.” TUT SRC president, Lucky Nkambule, gives this as the reason for shutting down all its nine campuses. “We are saying the academic calendar is going to be disturbed, but this is a genuine cause; students must have food to eat and a proper shelter to live.” In 2018, TUT closed its doors for six weeks due to similar protests; setting back academic activities.
SRC says it’s for the well-being of students. TUT management could not be reached for comment. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
