The National Taxi Alliance says taxis will be operating in Soweto on Friday despite Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi’s announcement otherwise. This week, Vadi announced a decision to close their routes and taxi ranks amid the violence between two warring associations. Several people have been killed and others wounded in the violence. On Thursday, the Nancefield-Dube West Taxi Association (Nanduwe) and the Witwatersrand Taxi Association (Wata) made an undertaking to Vadi that they have reached an agreement. The National Taxi Alliance which both associations belong to has denied that carrying on with operations would be defying the MEC. Spokesperson Theo Malele says, “The National Taxi Alliance leadership had proposed that we get an interpretation of the operating licence from the issuing office, that is the Directorate of the licensing and monitoring. If the there is peace between the two associations, I do not think that is in violation of the declaration.” Click below to watch related video:
