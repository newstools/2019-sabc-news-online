Zimbabwe’s ruling party says it’s willing to engage opposition parties with the aim of finding solutions to the current political impasse in that country. The official opposition MDC has indicated that it will only engage in talks if they’re held under the auspices of an independent mediator. The MDC says it’s engaging all stakeholders both in and outside the country to address the challenges facing Zimbabwe. Political tensions in Zimbabwe escalated after the government took a decision to increase fuel prices. This led to violent protests and destruction of property as Zimbabweans took to the streets. Many have called on parties in the country to start political dialogue that can address the economic meltdown. The Zimbabwean government has also responded to US President Donald Trump’s decision to renew sanctions against the country. Meanwhile, opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has indicated that while his party supports political dialogue, the international community must be involved. As the party prepares for its national elective congress, Chamisa is confident that the party will emerge stronger, but has lambasted those who have made themselves available for contesting leadership positions. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to be in Zimbabwe next week and these issues are likely to come up during the South Africa/Zimbabwe bi-national commission.
