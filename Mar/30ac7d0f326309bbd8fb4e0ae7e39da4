Department spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya says Ramaphosa will meet King Mswati the third to strengthen relations. “The President will engage on security issues across the the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. He will also engage on issues related to trade between the countries, but as close countries, neighbours, there is a lot that we need to engage,” says Mabaya.
