Johannesburg Water has called on residents to check Eskom’s loadshedding schedule and as a precaution, store water for use during the period that their area experiences a power outage. This comes as fears that the continued power outages could affect the city’s water supply. Joburg Water Spokesperson Isaac Dhludhlu says low pressure or loss of water could affect high-lying areas. However Dhludhlu adds there is no reason to panic. “As of now, we are able to provide water to all the residents of the City of Johannesburg. I think we shouldn’t cause unnecessary panic but as a precaution, we are saying loadshedding does have an impact on our operation in terms of being able to pump water, especially from the reservoirs to the towers. Mostly those that are in high-lying areas; there is a possibility of them being affected by water outage or low pressure. So we are saying you should make provisions in terms of making sure that you store water that will last you for the duration of that outage.”
