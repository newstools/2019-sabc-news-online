A Cape Town teacher who was suspended for slapping one of her learners in class will return to work next month. A disciplinary hearing against Clarissa Venter has been concluded. The incident was captured on video and went viral on social media last month. Venter had reprimanded the child for not having her work book and carrying her cell phone in class. The learner can also be seen shoving her desk into Venter. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Jessica Shelver says the learner has since left the school. “The disciplinary process with the San Souci teacher has now concluded. The SGB has ratified a decision that the teacher should receive a fine, a final written warning and has to attend anger management sessions. The teacher will now return to work at the start of the second term on the second of April.”
