Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) is demanding a representative on the SABC board. This comes as the committee sits to interview the 24 candidates shortlisted to fill vacancies on the public broadcaster’s board. The interviews have been delayed.  Cosatu’s Parliamentary Liaison Officer Mathew Parks says they have given the committee options on how to include labour representatives and if that fails they will go to court. He’s accused the committee of breaking the Broadcasting Act by side-lining labour on the board. “The PC on Communications hasn’t complied with the broadcasting act which requires them to include representative of workers or labour on the SABC board shortlist. We’ve written to the PC committee to say they must include labour representation on the shortlist. It’s not a question of favour to workers. Its a requirement of the broadcasting act and we’ve given different options to include it now or fill it later. Otherwise if they don’t we will go to court to force them to comply.”
