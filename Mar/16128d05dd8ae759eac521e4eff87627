The US has imposed sanctions on three senior officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo’s electoral commission, accusing them of corruption and obstructing the December presidential election. The US Treasury says in a statement that the commission’s organisation of the December 30 election, which led to Congo’s first ever transfer of power via the ballot box, failed to ensure that the vote reflected the will of the Congolese people. The statement stopped short of calling into question the legitimacy of President Félix Tshisekedi’s victory. This is despite what sources say is an outright rigging to deny runner-up Martin Fayulu the win.
