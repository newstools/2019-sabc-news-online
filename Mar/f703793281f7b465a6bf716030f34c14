Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete has offered her condolences to the African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu, after his daughter, Khwezi, apparently committed suicide. The incident took place at the Mthembu’s home in the Parliamentary village, Pelican Park, in Cape Town. Mbete spoke during the last meeting of the House for the 5th Parliament, as it prepared to rise ahead of the May elections. “On behalf of the presiding officers and the house, our thoughts and prayers are with our colleague Honourable Jackson Mthembu who I hope is watching as we convey our deepest, warmest sympathies.”
