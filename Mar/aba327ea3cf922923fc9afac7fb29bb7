Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi, says he has received representations from legal teams of two rival taxi associations in Soweto. Vadi had given the Witwatersrand Taxi Association (WATA) and Nancefield Dube West (NANDUWE) until Monday morning to present their arguments on why the routes should not be closed. Vadi says he will make his decision in the next day or two. He has also condemned the unlawful blockading of the Johannesburg CBD on Monday by an unknown group of taxi drivers calling themselves the Alliance for Transformation for All. “I have received representations from the legal firms representing WATA and NANDUWE. We are considering them. I will be meeting with the law enforcement agencies today – with the City of Johannesburg, making an assessment and considering the representations made and hopefully in a day or two I will be making a decision on this matter.” “Our main concern is really public safety, we don’t gain any pleasure from suspending operations of taxi association. They do good work, they fulfill a useful public service but we cannot allow a situation where willfully people just open fire at the slightest provocation,” says Vadi.
