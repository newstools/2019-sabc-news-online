It has emerged that the Australian gunman, who killed 49 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand, had scrawled white supremacist remarks on the weapons he used to commit the massacre. The 28-year-old self-proclaimed racist also published a manifesto on Twitter before live-streaming the killings. Facebook has since removed the video from its platform and the man’s Twitter account has been deleted. He is currently in police custody. The number 14 is also seen on the rifles, which may be a reference to “14 Words,” is a white supremacist slogan linked to Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf.” “Acre 1189,” a reference to the Crusades, is also written on the guns.
