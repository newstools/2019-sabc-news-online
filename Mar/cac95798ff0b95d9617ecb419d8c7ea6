Government needs to double its efforts if it’s to deal decisively with tuberculosis. Deputy President David Mabuza made this announcement during the launch of the Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign at Inanda, north of Durban on Friday. He is the chair of the South African National Aids Council. The disease is responsible for more than a million deaths worldwide every year. Mabuza wants traditional leaders to play their part in the fight against the epidemic. “We should not allow to be defeated by TB. Working together we can conquer this disease.” Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has warned of what he calls a catastrophe if the problem is not addressed urgently. “If there is a neighbour who has TB, you must know that 15 other people are going to get that TB. So, make it your business to come and screen so we put you on treatment,” says Motsoaledi. Mabuza says South Africa aims to get 80 000 new people on treatment by the end of 2020.
