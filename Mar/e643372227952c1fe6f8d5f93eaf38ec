The ashes of cruise ship employee, Buhle Bhengu who passed away in the Bahamas are due to arrive at Durban’s King Shaka International Airport on Wednesday. Bhengu was cremated on Monday in the presence of family members, after authorities in the Bahamas did not want to repatriate her body, citing health hazards. According to Bhengu’s death certificate, she died from TB. National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa President, Muzi Hlengwa, initiated talks with Britain and the USA, as there are no direct flights from the island to South Africa. Hlengwa says Bhengu’s ashes will be buried in a culturally dignified way. “I would like to thank every person who participated in ensuring that the family of Buhle Bhengu finds closure in this saga. We would like to thank the media who ensured the story is covered clearly. The support that we got from abroad is amazing.”
