Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC, Ismail Vadi, says he has not taken a decision to lift the closure of ranks and routes operated by warring Soweto taxi associations WATA and NANDUWE. He says for now the ranks and routes will remain closed. The National Taxi Alliance says they’ve handed over a document to Vadi’s office in which the two associations agree and commit to stop the violence. They’ve also agreed to set up a joint committee comprising officials from both associations to monitor operations on a daily basis. Vadi says he has not been fully briefed on the contents of this document. “Well we’ll have to see what the terms and conditions are of the so-called agreement. I have not had full sight of it.  I have not had a full briefing from my officials.  Remember, this is not a decision I take on my own… I have to confer with the City of Johannesburg because it is an interested party in the matter. I’ve got to confer with the law enforcement agencies to give me a situation report on what is their assessment on the ground. Are there tensions, are there any visible signs of conflict and violence.  So it’s not a decision I take on my own there.” Watch a related video below:
