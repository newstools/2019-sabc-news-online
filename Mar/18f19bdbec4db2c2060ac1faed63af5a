Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the newly-released school admission regulations for the province will soon be gazetted. The guidelines which Lesufi announced on Sunday will also expand the province’s feeder zones for schools from the current radius of five kilometres to 30 kilometres. In 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of the provincial Education Department, after Lesufi took the matter to court. “The good thing that excites us is that no one now will say, I’m excluded because I come from the township. But it also paves for future achievements because learners must not only go to the suburbs. One day others will go to the townships. So this regulation therefore paves for that future. And we are excited that the doors of learning have been open for all our children.” Click on video below:
