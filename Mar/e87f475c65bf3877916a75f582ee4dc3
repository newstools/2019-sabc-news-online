Prince William will visit New Zealand in April to honour victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings that claimed 50 lives. New Zealandâ€™s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, and Kensington Palace have made the announcement. Ardern, who will attend a national remembrance service for the victims tomorrow, says the Duke of Cambridge will represent his grandmother Queen Elizabeth the second, the official head of state in the former British colony. The royals previously expressed their sympathies at the shooting attacks on two Christchurch mosques earlier this month by a self-avowed white supremacist.
