The Deputy Minister of Finance, Mondli Gungubele and chairperson of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) board is adamant that he has nothing to do with what has happened at the PIC. His statement comes as labour federation, South African Federation of Trade Union (SAFTU) demands Gungubele’s resignation as Deputy Minister after conflicting testimonies were presented before the Commission of Inquiry into impropriety at the PIC last week, suggesting that Gungubele may have lied under oath. Gungubele said he was not pressurised to resign from the PIC board. However, PIC board member Dudu Hlatshwayo said Gungubele received a call from the Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni, telling them to resign immediately or face being fired. Gungubele says his conscious would not allow him to lie. “That’s why I said to one guy, I do sleep, although I’m very careful to deal with the issues that are before the commission. Fortunately in this country, there are always processes which are independent and credible, one of them is this commission of inquiry which I expect to end by April and it will make pronouncements, but I dare say my conscience is clear,” says Gungubele. The commission’s hearing will on Monday enter the second week in Pretoria. Watch a related video below:
