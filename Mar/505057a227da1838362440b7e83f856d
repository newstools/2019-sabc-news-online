President Cyril Ramphosa says if Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa) does not get its house in order, heads will roll. He spent three hours in a train from Mabopane to Pretoria CBD on Monday morning. Ramaphosa says things must change at Prasa – for the betterment of train services in the country. He experienced first-hand the daily experiences of millions of South Africans who rely on public transport. The train got stuck four times, while on route from Mabopane to Pretoria CBD on Monday morning. Ramaphosa also admitted that loadshedding currently being implemented by Eksom is a national crisis. He says urgent steps need to be taken to rectify the matter. “Loadshedding causes damage to South Africans and it’s a challenge to the growth of the country’s economy.” The president also applauded Police Minister Bheki Cele for a job well done after the arrest of ANC official, Mluleki Ndobe, for the murder of Sindiso Magaqa. He says the police must continue to make sure perpetrators of crime are brought to book. Ramaphosa has assured South Africans that things will change for the better in the country. This if everyone takes the initiative and go vote on May 8.
