Former Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, has denied claims that he has any relationship with the Gupta family. He says they did, however, interact at various sports events due to his position as Minister of Sport. Testifying before the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, Mbalula says he did not adhere to the family’s advances. “I never had a relationship with the Guptas. As I have mentioned, they are involved in sports. I did not cooperate with them largely in terms of their interest in sports because of this background I had. Informally we would discuss and vitiate about it,” says Mbalula. Click link below for more on the story:
