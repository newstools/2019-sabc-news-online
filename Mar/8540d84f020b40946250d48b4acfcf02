Chair of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture , Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has reserved judgment on the application of former SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane, to cross examine Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Advocate Michelle le Roux, who is presenting Gordhan, earlier said that Moyane’s application is another attempt to challenge his removal as Commissioner and to further revive the narrative of the so-called rogue unit. Le Roux says with regards to the SARS matters, Moyane is essentially asking the Zondo Commission to review the outcome of the Nugent Commission. Le Roux says retired Judge Robert Nugent dealt extensively with the so-called ‘rogue unit’ matter and found that there was no wrongdoing in the establishment of the unit. Moyane’s legal representative, Advocate Dali Mpofu, suggested to the Commission that Gordhan should be charged with treason for his involvement in the establishing of the so-called rogue unit at SARS.
