Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has declared two days of national mourning, starting on Saturday. This as the death toll passes the 200 mark in Zimbabwe and stands at more than 500 for Mozambique and Malawi. The President, during his state-of-the-nation address, did indicate that some bodies were indeed being discovered in Mozambique. He also highlighted that he’s working with his Mozambican counterparts to make sure that all the bodies are accounted for and decent burials are conducted for all those who will either be discovered in Zimbabwe or Mozambique. However, he did confirm that bodies are washing up as far as Mozambique and they are working the Mozambican authorities to either repatriate or to bury the bodies that would have been discovered.
