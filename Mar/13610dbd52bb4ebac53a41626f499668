Britain’s Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, said on Sunday Prime Minister Theresa May “absolutely” had his support, adding that it was a time for”cool heads” to focus on getting her twice-rejected Brexit agreement approved by lawmakers. “I think it is not the time to change the captain of the ship. I think what we need to do is to chart the right course, and the prime minister has charted that right course by making sure that we have a deal that honours the referendum mandate,”he said. Press reports late on Saturday said senior minister in May’s government were discussing a leadership coup, with Gove or May’s de facto deputy David Lidington mentioned as possible candidates to replace her in the short term.
