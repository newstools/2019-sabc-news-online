Labour union, Nehawu says the strike at SARS will continue in the coming week – despite ongoing salary negotiations. The strike began on Thursday when workers who are members of Nehawu and the Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) rejected the 7% salary increase offered by SARS. The workers are demanding 11% increase. Nehawu’s national spokesperson, Khaya Xaba says, “We are going ahead with the strike, even though there are ongoing negotiations with the employer. We’ll report back the progress that has been made to our members in the morning in the picket lines. Our members will then give us a mandate whether to continue or to end the strike. But now as things stand, the strike is still ongoing.” The wage negotiations have resumed between parties at the CCMA in Johannesburg. SARS filed for an urgent interdict this week to restrict workers to only picketing at its head office in Pretoria and campus in Alberton, south of Johannesburg. SARS Remuneration and Benefits Executive Takalani Musekwa says “We are hoping that we will be able to find each other and make some progress on the positions that the parties are currently are at.”
