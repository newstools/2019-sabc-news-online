Minister of International Relations Lindiwe Sisulu has thanked the Bahamas government for their assistance in the matter involving the KwaZulu-Natal woman who died in that country. Twenty-nine-year-old Nobuhle Bhengu, who was working on a cruise ship, fell ill and was admitted to a hospital in the Bahamas where she died last month. The family has been trying for the last three weeks to get her body repatriated to South Africa. In a statement, the International Relations and Co-operation confirms that the Bhengu family have agreed to cremating their daughterâ€™s body and returning to South Africa with her ashes. The statement says that the cremation was recommended by local authorities in the Bahamas citing health and safety reasons. While two family members are already in the Bahamas, it is believed that others are finalising their travel documents to depart. Related Video
