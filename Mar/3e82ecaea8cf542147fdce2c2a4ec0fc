The seven accused, who were arrested in connection with dealing and manufacturing drugs, have briefly appeared before the Durban Magistrateâ€™s Court. The state opposed bail as it wanted the verification of the addresses of the accused. Four of the accused were arrested at the Spring Field Park while the other three were arrested in a house in Durban Westville. Police Spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo says the entire operation is estimated to be worth over R50 million. Naidoo says they have also uncovered equipment and chemicals used to manufacture mandrax. The accused will remain in custody and be back in court on the 11th of this month.
