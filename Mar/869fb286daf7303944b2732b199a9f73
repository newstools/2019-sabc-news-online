Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni says he is confident that new South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner, Edward Kieswetter will restore confidence in the Revenue Service as a respected tax collector. Kieswetter’s appointment takes effect on 1 May for a term of five years. It follows the President’s sacking of former Commissioner, Tom Moyane last year following the Nugent Commission of Inquiry’s report on SARS that found Moyane unfit to hold office. The President says the former group executive of Alexander Forbes, has the experience, integrity and skills required to turn SARS around by restoring revenue collection and the tax collector’s credibility and integrity. The Ministry of Finance says Kieswetter emerged as the strongest candidate for the position based on his past experience as Deputy Commissioner of SARS between 2004 and 2009.  SARS strike Meanwhile, an estimated 10 000 SARS employees belonging to two labour unions, Nehawu and PSA, are set to embark on a nationwide strike  following collapse in wage negotiations. PSA deputy manager, Tahir Maepa says the decision to down tools follows failed meetings with SARS leadership earlier this week. Maepa says the SARS management deviated from the previously agreed CCMA-proposed salary negotiation settlement. He says the last straw was when SARS attempted to force the unions into a long-term agreement. “In the evening when we were supposed to go into a meeting things have changed and all that was withdrawn and there was a new proposal that was put on the table. Basically attempting to bind us into a long term agreement with a lot of uncertainties. So that has angered us and Nehawu and we decided that the Commissioner is not serious. He doesn’t want to find an amicable solution to this particular impasse. We decided that we are forging ahead with our strike action tomorrow morning.”
