National Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says Tuberculosis (TB) remains the number one killer among the infectious diseases in the world. He made the statement after attending a church service at the St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town to commemorate World TB Day. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable, but more than 4500 people worldwide die of TB every day. Ten million are infected globally. Motsoaledi says 4 million people internationally are not receiving treatment. “In South Africa the missing it is about 160 000. Between April and September last year, we followed people in their homes, we discovered 38 000 had TB, but didn’t know. Those people are now on treatment, but we want to reach 80 000 people by the end of 2020.”
