The Department of Water and Sanitation in the Western Cape says it has seen an influx of applications for permission to drill boreholes. The department has announced that the combined average dam level in the province has more than doubled compared to same time in 2018. The level is currently more than 52%, compared to last year at 23.23%. The department’s Mashudu Murohvi says many major institutions like hospitals have been applying for boreholes, but there are several factors that have to be considered. “The quantity for this application for ground water has significantly increased due to the drought that has occurred. Literally, each and every institution is applying for ground water and others are even applying to get out of the Western Cape water supply grid. The risk of over obstructions exists, but as a department any obstructions of ground water requires authorisations.” Click below for more on the story:
