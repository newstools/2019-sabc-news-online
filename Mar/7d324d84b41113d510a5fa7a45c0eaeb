The murder case against five police officials who shot and killed 29 year old SANDF member Thato Motale has been postponed to 5 April by the Molopo Regional Court in Mahikeng, North West. The police officials are accused of shooting and killing Motale who was in the company of his friends on the 19th April 2018 at the height of the Supra Must Fall protests. The case was postponed due to non-appearance of one of the accused. Obed Masibi and four others are facing a charge of murder and four counts of attempted murder. The courtâ€™s gallery was half full by members of the community, family and friends of the deceased. Motale was allegedly killed by members of the police Tactical Response Team along Airport road last year in April, while with his friends on a taxi. They were accused of robbery in Mmabatho Palms and in a local tuck shop. The accused are all out on bail.
