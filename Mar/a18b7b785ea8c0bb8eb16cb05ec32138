The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal announced on Tuesday that all members charged with serious crimes must step aside from positions of responsibility in government, pending the conclusion of their legal cases. Recently some mayors in the province have been charged with serious offences. Charges against Mayor Mluleki Ndobe in connection with the murder of former ANC Youth leader Sindiso Magaqa  have been withdrawn. However, there are two other ANC mayors currently facing charges ranging from murder to conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the killing of ANC members and leaders. Speaking on SAfm’s Sunrise, KwaZulu-Natal ANC Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says, if a comrade is charged with a serious crime, it is important that the person protects the integrity of the party. He says the only way to do that is by recusing themselves from their duties. “It doesn’t matter if the person is out on bail, as long as they are in and out of court, they must step aside.” “If the person remains in custody, it is important that they recuse themselves from any party duties within 14 days. If they do not, the leadership will be forced to make the decision for them,” says Ntuli. Listen below for more <a href="https://iono.fm/e/670008">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
