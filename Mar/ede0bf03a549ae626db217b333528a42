The South African Revenue Service (SARS) says it has obtained an interim court order interdicting the National Education, Health and Allied Workersâ€™ Union (Nehawu) and Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) members from picketing in places other than those specified in the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) Picketing Rules. SARS says the picketing at its head office in Pretoria and the Alberton campus by its striking employees on Thursday was illegal. Around 10 000 workers affiliated to the two trade unions have embarked on a nationwide strike, over a wage dispute. Workers are demanding an 11.4% wage increase across the board, while the revenue service is offering 7%. On Thursday, 33 out of 53 walk-in branches were closed as a result of the strike, with the rest functioning on a diminished capacity. Watch a related video below:
