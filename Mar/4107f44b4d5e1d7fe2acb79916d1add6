At least 10 people have been killed after heavy rains deluged two flood-prone provinces of Mozambique, the UN said Monday, as meteorologists issued a cyclone warning. Six people died in the central Tete province in recent days while four were swept away in the coastal Zambezia province, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report. More than 62,000 people have so far been affected by floods in the two provinces as well as in the northern Niassa province. “At least 10 deaths reported, and 62,975 people were affected by the floods,” the UN said. National authorities have warned that “at least 120,000 people are at risk of flooding and heavy rains in the coming days,” the UN said. A tropical storm which brought heavy rains and strong winds is forecast to develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming days. “The system is moving towards the coastal region of Sofala and Zambezia provinces which may reach tropical cyclone stage influencing the weather conditions from March 13, 2019,” it warned. Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries, is often battered by deadly flooding and storms. In 2000, floods claimed at least 800 lives, and more than 100 were killed in 2015. Floods have already claimed 30 lives and left over 230,000 people without shelter in southern Malawi which borders Mozambique.  Floods in southern Malawi have killed 30 people and left over 230,000 people without shelter, a minister said on Sunday. Homeland Security Minister Nicholas Dausi, whose ministry is also responsible for disaster management affairs, on Sunday visited people affected by the deluges in two of the 14 southern districts affected. He said his ministry had received reports of 30 deaths and about 238,000 villagers losing their homes since the start of the incessant downpours earlier this week. “Their immediate needs are food, tents, blankets and chlorine to treat drinking water and anti-malaria medication,” he said.
