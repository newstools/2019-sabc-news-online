One of the candidates who wants to be a Board member of the SABC, Rowan Nicholls, says he’s satisfied with the public broadcaster’s election policies. Parliament’s Communications Committee is interviewing 24 candidates, shortlisted to fill eight vacancies in the SABC Board. Nicholls says he believes that all the political parties are given an equitable amount of air time. Nicholls says, “I think they need to remain neutral from a party political point of view.” “Some people felt that the ruling party is getting more exposure, I don’t actually agree with that. I think that President Cyril Ramaphosa does because he is the president.” Watch interviews below
