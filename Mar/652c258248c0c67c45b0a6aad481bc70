The National Department of Health is commemorating World TB Day in Cape Town on Sunday by attending a church service in the St Georgeâ€™s Cathedral. Minister Aaron Motsoaledi will afterwards give an update on the state of TB in the country and efforts being made to end the global epidemic. World TB Day is commemorated to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of Tuberculosis. March 24 marks the day in 1882 when Dr Robert Koch announced that he had discovered the bacterium that causes TB, which opened the way towards diagnosing and curing this disease.
