 A former independent non-executive director of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) is testifying before the judicial commission of inquiry into impropriety at the PIC in Pretoria. Vuyo Jack also worked at the PIC’s audit risk committee and the social ethics committee. He work at the PIC from December 2012 to 2015. Earlier today, Deputy Finance Minister Mondli Gungubele and chairperson of the PIC board told the SABC that he had nothing to do with what had happened at the PIC. His statement came as labour federation SAFTU demanded Gungubele’s resignation as Deputy Minister after conflicting testimonies were presented before the commission of inquiry last week, suggesting that Gungubele may have lied under oath. Gungubele said he was not pressurised to resign from the PIC board. However, PIC board member Dudu Hlatshwayo said Gungubele received a call from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, telling them to resign immediately or face being fired.
