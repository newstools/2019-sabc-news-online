Justice Minister Michael Masutha says his department will continue to implement anti-racism punitive measures as it strives for a non-racial society. His department has called on the public to support the Anti-Racism Week from 14 to 21 March. The aim of the week is to mobilise all citizens to support the long-term anti-racism campaign, in pursuit of a non-racial and free South Africa that belongs all who live in it. Anti-Racism Week is held annually during Human Rights Month. It culminates on Human Rights Day and the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Masutha says the department will ensure that racism remains on its national agenda. “We believe it’s important we keep on championing a variety of activities during the course of this week which focuses on such activities as lectures targeting working places; areas where the incidents of racism are particularly rife and particularly problematic in addressing, but it’s also a question of who has access, and a question of underlying socio-economic inequalities that find expression in racially-based allocation of opportunities and resources.” Click below for more on the story:
