The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says it’s continuing with its relief efforts in areas hit by cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The troops have been deployed to the neighbouring countries by President Cyril Ramaphosa two weeks ago. Due to the impact of the disaster, the SANDF expects its work to continue for several more weeks. The SANDF has been assisting with helicopter search and rescue operations and critical aid delivery. Lietenant General Zakes Msimang, Chief of the South African Air Force in charge of this massive operation, explains: “The scale of this disaster is unimaginable, it’s for this reason that the South African government, through the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the South African National Defence Force has sent us to come here and support the Mozambican people.” “Our mission is to provide aid relief to the people of Mozambique.”  Related video click below:
