The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Inquiry has begun hearing an application from former SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane to cross-examine Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan. Moyane’s legal representative, Advocate Dali Mpofu, has told the Commission that for evidence to be accepted, it needs to be tested. Gordhan earlier expressed his concern about the application, saying it is been driven by political rather than legal considerations. The Commission’s spokesperson Reverend Mbuyiselo Stemela says, “Even in the regulations of the Commission it is clearly stated that any witness appearing before the Commission may be cross examined by a person only if the chairperson permits such cross examination. Should he deem it necessary and in the best interest of the function of the Commission. Therefore the application that is going to be heard before the Commission this morning is precisely on those grounds that the chairperson of the Commission Deputy Chief Justice Zondo will listen to the merits of the application and will make decision.” Watch the live stream of the State Capture Inquiry..
