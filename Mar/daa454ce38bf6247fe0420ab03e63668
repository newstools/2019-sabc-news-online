Family, friends, the community of Soshanguve, north or Pretoria and the cast and crew of Matwetwe have are attending the funeral of actor Sibusiso Khwinana. Khiwnana was killed last week in Arcadia for his cellphone. Khiwnana was the lead actor in the local comedy film, Matwetwa. Minister of Police, Bheki Cele and the premier of Gauteng, David Makhura are expected to address the mourners. His cousin, Khalo Khwinana, says Khwinana was an exceptional person. “Your amazing spirit, your respect for elders and piers alike, your humility, your love for family, your passion and drive and most importantly your love for the Lord is what you will be remembered for mostly. We feel robbed of the person you were supposed to become and I know there is so much more you still had to become, But we will choose not to dwell on the loss but bask in the mark that you left in our lives and our hearts.” Khwinana played the role of Lefa in the popular film. He will be laid to rest at the Zandfontein cemetary outside the capital. Khwinana has been described as one of the best film actors to come out of this country. Matwetwe comedy film producer Kagiso Lediga says the highly talented Khwinana was a natural. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane says the three suspects identified for the murder of film star Sibusiso Khwinana will be arrested soon. Nkosi-Malobane appealed to those allegedly hiding the suspects to contact the police.
