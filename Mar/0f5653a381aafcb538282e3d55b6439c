The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has taken the opportunity during the debate in the National Assembly on Growing and Transforming South Africa by calling for South Africans to vote the ANC out of government. The party believes this will ensure transformation in the country is achieved. IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa says, “What should South Africans do on the eighth of May? We’ll vote the ANC to go out of office. Your time has expired. All that you have shown is what you have achieved for yourselves and not for our people.” Click on video below:
