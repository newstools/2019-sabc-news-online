United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader General Bantu Holomisa says his party has grown in KwaZulu-Natal. Holomisa also says the party has been well received in the province. He was addressing party supporters at Msinga in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The party once had a large following in Richmond in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. Bemoaning the slow transformation in the country’s economy, the UDM leader says black South Africans have yet to feel the proper benefits of economic emancipation of 25 years into democracy. Holomisa and the party’s KwaZulu-Natal provincial leaders were on a campaign trail at Pomeroy in uMsinga. He told his supporters during a mini-rally that his party has a solution to the multitude of problems facing South Africa. “The truth of the matter is that black South Africans have not been improved since 1994 especially on facilitating for them to become industrialists.” “There is no way that 52 million black South Africans must continue to look for jobs from companies which are managed or controlled by four million white population.” He argues that “Something is wrong. We need to create a national fund to make sure that those who have skills in the black communities we can invest in them to become wealth creators who will create jobs.”  Related video click below:
