African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee member, Naledi Pandor, says government has invested R400 million in an entrepreneurship fund to encourage graduates to start their own businesses after finishing their studies. Pandor was speaking in Mitchell’s Plain on the Cape Flats in her capacity as an ANC deployee, as part of the party’s election campaign. She says the youth should learn to create jobs for themselves rather than relying on being employed. Pandor says the fund, which is being disbursed at all universities, is being used to train students and empower lecturers.
