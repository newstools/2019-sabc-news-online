The VIP protection afforded to former African Union Commission Chair, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was not improper and the probe should be suspended as there was no wrongdoing. The Dlamini-Zuma case was one of the ten investigation reports released by the Public Protector. The investigation follows a complaint laid by the DA in 2017. DA MP Zakhele Mbhele asked the Public protector to probe maladministration and improper conduct against former Police Minister Fikile Mbalula. Deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga says Dlamini-Zuma had the right to Presidential protection services after police identified continued threats against her. “The protection by PPS was suitably continued after the expiry of the term of office by Dr Dlamini-Zuma. Due to threats identified by the State Security Agency, we could not find reason to conclude that Dr Dlamini-Zuma was improperly awarded VIP protection services by the Minister of Police. Having regard to the evidence received and for the reasons advanced herein above, I am unable to pursue the matter any further and am inclined to conclude that the allegations of improper provisions of the VIP protection services to Dr Dlamini-Zuma are not substantiated. I have decided to close the investigation.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
