Former Public Investment Corporation (PIC) Chief Financial Officer Matshepo More’s relationship with the organisation’s former executive head of Information Technology Luyanda Ntuane became so strained that she refused to have one-on-one meetings with him. Ntuane says the situation was so very dire that his department was overlooked for bonuses and salary increases despite them doing their best. Ntuane told the PIC Commission in Pretoria that the frosty relationship jeopardised the entire IT security system at the PIC. Ntuane, who was supposed to report directly to the CFO, says he did not get any financial support to upgrade the organisation’s IT systems and this left it open to bugs and hackers. “She made it very difficult to meet for one-on-one meetings and these meetings are important because you want to align your principles between yourself and your boss. It put us in a catch 22 position. It’s also important to know an asset manager the size of the PIC would still in this day and age be calculating bonuses on spread sheets and it’s by no shock that I knew exactly who was getting what type of increase and on what basis.” Ntuane says he was then suspended without documentation. The executives cited favouritism, procurement irregularities and information from a whistle blower as evidence for his suspension. He has denied that he was given representation and opportunity to explain himself after the suspension. “The external law firm took my computer, iPad and iPhone and also requested that I give my external hard drive which was my personal hard drive on the strength that I would have connected them to my work computer at some point. I then left the premises and drove back home and after a month of not hearing anything from the PIC I wrote a letter to Dr Madjila citing several issues that I had with the suspension. In fact the suspension letter was not handed to me at that time.” Click below for more on the story:
