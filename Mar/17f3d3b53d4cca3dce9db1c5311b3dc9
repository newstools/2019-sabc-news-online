Former President Jacob Zuma has taken to Twitter to slam the panel that has compiled a report which revealed that during his presidency, elements of the State Security Agency (SSA) were adapted and used to fight factional African National Congress (ANC) political battles. The High Level Review Panel was headed by former minister, Sydney Mufamadi. The report that was published by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office on Saturday, details Zuma’s serious breach of the Constitution, during his nearly nine years in office. It says the SSA targeted Ramaphosa in the run-up to him becoming head of the ANC in 2017, and then President of the country. “I’ve never sold out nor written letters to the SB. I feel nothing when Apartheid spies call me corrupt. I hope people are not opening a can of worms which they might regret,” says Zuma, responding on his official Twitter account. See the related tweet below: Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for criminal charges to be laid against all those implicated in allegations of mismanagement of the agency. DA Chief Whip in Parliament, John Steenhuisen, says they should include former SSA head, Authur Fraser, who is now Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services. “Many of these transgressions occurred while Mr Fraser was DG at SSA. The report makes it very clear, there was criminal and illegal activity during the course of the PAN project. As the lead on that project, Mr Frazer needs to face up to that responsibility now.” Watch a related video below:  Read the full report below: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5764701-High-Level-Review-Panel-on-the-SSA.js", {  width: 600,    height: 800,    sidebar: false,    text: false,    pdf: false,    container: "#DV-viewer-5764701-High-Level-Review-Panel-on-the-SSA"  });
