The Zimbabwean government has thanked South Africa for its steadfast opposition to target sanctions at the country. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has also acknowledged South Africa for being a sanctuary for many Zimbabweans during his countryâ€™s economic hardships. He was speaking during a gala dinner in honour of President Cyril Ramaphosa and his delegation at the State House in the capital Harare on Monday night. Ramaphosa has been consistent in his call to ease sanctions on Zimbabwe. Mnangagwa thanked Pretoria for all the support they have been receiving. Ramaphosa says with 45 bilateral agreements signed between South Africa and Zimbabwe, both governments should prioritise the implementation of these agreements. He cited lack of progress in the operationalisation of the One Stop Border Post project at Beit Bridge which seeks to increase trade between the two countries. Ramaphosa arrived in Harare on Monday night for the third session of the Bi-National Commission starting in the capital Harare later Tuesday morning. Click on videos below:
