The man accused of raping a seven-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Silverton, Pretoria, last year will go on trial in the High Court in Pretoria in September. The trial date has been set to take place from the 9th to the 20th of September.  Nicholas Ninow, faces five charges including rape, intimidation and possession of drugs after he allegedly forced the girl into the men’s toilets where he raped her. In his earlier court appearance the suspect was found fit to stand trial after a 30 day psychiatric evaluation that the court had ordered. This after the court heard that Ninow suffered from bipolar disorder and had been abusing drugs from the age of 14. Themba Masango from the Not In My Name movement was in court. “We are confident that the court of law will actually deal with him in the harshest possible way. So 9 to 20 September, we are hoping that it is going to be a quick, clean trial and that he will receive the harshest sentence and we will be here once again.” WATCH BELOW:
