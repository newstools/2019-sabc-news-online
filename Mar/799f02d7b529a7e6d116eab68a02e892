Eskom has declared that Stage-two load shedding will commence on Thursday. Earlier the power utility implemented Stage-one load shedding. Eskom says the move is due to breakdowns at various plants which has resulted in an imbalance between supply and demand. Customers can check the rotational schedule with their local municipalities and on Eskomâ€™s website.
