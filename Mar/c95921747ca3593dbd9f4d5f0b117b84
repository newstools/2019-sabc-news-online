Former President Jacob Zuma says he is battling to understand why AfriForum has resuscitated the culpable homicide case against his son Duduzane. Zuma was speaking at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, north of Johannesburg, where his son Duduzane is currently on trial. Duduzane is facing one count of culpable homicide and another of reckless and negligent driving. The second count of culpable homicide was withdrawn on Tuesday. Duduzane’s vehicle, a Porche 911 turbo, crashed into a minibus taxi on the M1 highway in January 2014, resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube on the scene. Former President Zuma, who came to support his son Duduzane during his trial on Wednesday, has raised questions as to why the culpable homicide case against his son was reinstated.  In late 2017, lobby group AfriForum gave the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) an ultimatum to prosecute Zuma for culpable homicide, saying if this did not happen, they would privately prosecute him. AfriForum’s Gerrie Nel said the NPA erred in its 2015 decision not to prosecute him for his role in the fatal car crash. The former President also said that it is clear that the state has a weak case and that there is no evidence to prove that Duduzane was reckless or negligent.
