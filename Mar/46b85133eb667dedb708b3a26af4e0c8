Former Correctional Services Commissioner, Linda Mti, together with his five co-accused are expected to appear in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Wednesday in connection with tender procurement irregularities of millions of rands. Mti and his former Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Patrick Gillingham and two former Bosasa top executives Angelo Agrizzi and Andries van Tonder,  are facing charges of fraud and corruption. They were arrested in February following a marathon investigation by the Hawks into  the allegations of tender irregularities involving African Global Operations, formerly Bosasa. The six were released on R20 000 bail each and were asked to return to the same court on Wednesday. Watch a related video below:
