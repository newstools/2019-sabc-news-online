The Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State capture on Tuesday is hearing the evidence of Former Fuel Sourcing Manager at Eskom Johann Bester,  in Parktown, Johannesburg. The Commission is also expected to hear the testimonies of Standard Bank head of Compliance, Ian Sinton and former business rescue practitioner of Optimum coal mine, Piers Marsden. On Monday, Bester said that Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources first tried to secure a coal supply contract with Eskom through its Vierfontein coal mine before Eskom finally settled on the Brakfontein mine. Bester said he was also reluctant about Tegeta’s Brakfontein mine because there were already doubts that its coal would meet the required quality standards. He said Eskom and Tegeta finally agreed on a coal supply agreement from Brakfontein for R13.50 per gigajoule for a period of five years. Watch below
