The founder of the Save South Africa campaign, Sipho Pityana, has condemned former President Jacob Zuma’s latest violations of the Constitution. It has been revealed that the violations involve the State Security Agency’s (SSA) apparent illegal spying on civil society organisations such as Fees Must Fall, Right2Know and Save SA. “It’s something that we’ve always expected, instead of focussing on nations security the former President used this to focus on law abiding citizens, organisations etc. In some of our meetings there were attempts to disrupt them, some of the leaders of these were intimidated and in some instances they were assaulted.” Pityana says that political accountability should be given to those responsible for the violations. “Ultimately there must be political accountability. President Zuma is now out of the way, he still must answer because this was nothing short of criminal activities so he must be one among those that are held responsible including the political executives of the time, but we must identify the agents that were directly involved in the activities… they must be removed from the system and be taken to our courts of law.” Click on audio below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/664030">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>  DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5764701-High-Level-Review-Panel-on-the-SSA.js", {  width: 600,    height: 800,    sidebar: false,    text: false,    pdf: false,    container: "#DV-viewer-5764701-High-Level-Review-Panel-on-the-SSA"  });
