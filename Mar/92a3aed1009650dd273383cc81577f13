The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has launched a multi-platform production called Democracy Gauge. The project, which commemorates 25 years of South Africa’s democracy, starts on Monday 4 March 2019 and will run until the end of the year. South Africans go to the polls in crunch general elections on May 8. Democracy Gauge is about the electorate, their lived experiences, and their views on the country’s successes, failures and challenges. Over 200 South Africans will be profiled in television and radio and online inserts as well as a current affairs programme presented by well known host – Bongani Bingwa. They will share their lives and experiences of 25 years of democracy. “Democracy Gauge places the power with the citizen and supports the notion that while elections are the centerpiece of democracy, the decision on who governs lies with the electorate. It provides an unscripted and unrestrained opportunity to the electorate to give their personal accounts without the involvement of politicians making their promises or analysts predicting outcomes on their behalf,” the broadcaster statement explains.
