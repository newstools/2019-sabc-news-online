The Johannesburg Metro Police Department has urged motorists to exercise caution on the roads as traffic lights in various parts of the city are off due to loadshedding. The power utility will continue to cut power until Wednesday, as it struggles with capacity shortages. Large parts of the country is currently experiencing stage 2 loadshedding until 9 ‘o’clock this morning. From 9 am until 11pm stage 4 loadshedding will start. JPMD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says officers have been deployed to some busy intersections. “JMPD officers are currently directing traffic at most of the intersections in the Johannesburg CBD due to loadshedding as some of the traffic lights are working and others not. Officers can be seen on Trump Street, Anderson Street, Eloff Street, Simmons Street and Marisburg Road as well as Joe Slovo Drive and Carse O’Gowrie in Houghton.” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Eskom board chairperson Jabu Mabuza will on Tuesday morning brief the media on the current electricity supply problems that the country is currently experiencing. Eskom says it will continue to implement stage 4 loadshedding. The power utility has suffered repeated faults at its coal-fired power stations, along with low water levels at hydro-electric plants and diesel shortages. President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the load shedding were very worrying and authorities were working around the clock to keep the lights on. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
