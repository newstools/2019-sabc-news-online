The African National Congress (ANC) has condemned what it says is the hacking of the communication devices of its Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte. The party says Duarteâ€™s emails and messaging systems have been targeted and interfered with. In a statement, the ANC adds that a WhatsApp text purporting to be from Duarte has also been circulated. It does not give details of the text message. The party says Duarte will lay a criminal charge with the police and request an investigation. It has undertaken to look at ways to prevent further incidents to ensure that its leaders are able to communicate in privacy and safety.
