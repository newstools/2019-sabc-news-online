Former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, has confirmed that Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha met with Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. Masutha told the Justice Portfolio Committee recently that he had met Watson in Port Elizabeth while attending the July 2016 ANC Siyanqoba election rally. He said that he had stayed over at one of the Bosasa houses over that weekend, as he was struggling to find accommodation. Speaking at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, in Parktown Johannesburg on Friday, Agrizzi says he does not believe the meeting went well. “I was well aware of it the meeting and yes it did happen, the meeting took place and if I remember correctly he went there with his brother and it was very similar to the meeting I had with Vincent Smith. I don’t think it was a success at all. ” Click video below:
