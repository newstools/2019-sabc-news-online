Three more people have been arrested in connection with the murder of Thoriso Themane. This brings to nine the number of suspects behind bars for the brutal killing of Thurisho. A memorandum of grievances was handed over to Limpopo Provincial Commissioner by #JusticeforThoriso movement against gangsterism and drug abuse. Hundreds of protesters painted Polokwane in black, in support of the hangtags #justiceforThoriso. The protest follows the brutal killing of 27-year-old Thoriso Themane last weekend. Themane was allegedly brutally killed by a group of school boys between 15 and 16 years old. The memorandum of grievances was handed over to the Polokwane police station. Co-ordinator of the #JusticeforThoriso march Phaku Murua has read out the memorandum. “ Our demands in the memorandum, we want complete arrest of all involved in the brutal and senseless murder of our brother Thorisho Themane. No bail for the murders. Number three finalisation of all pending crimes committed, especially of one of the people who have been arrested – he stabbed a learner last year and he was released back to the community…”  The memorandum of demands was received by the Provincial commissioner, and he was given seven working days to respond. Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba says they have arrested three more suspects yesterday until today. They now have almost nine suspects arrested to date linked to the murder of Thoriso. Thoriso’s funeral will take place on Saturday at Jake Botes hall in Polokwane at 07 AM.
