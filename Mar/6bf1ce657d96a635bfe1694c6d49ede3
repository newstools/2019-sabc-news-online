Eskom will continue with stage two load shedding from 9am on Saturday to 11pm. The power utility implemented stage two load shedding on Friday. Eskom implemented eight straight days of nationwide electricity cuts to prevent the national grid from collapsing. It says its maintenance teams are working around the clock to return generation units to the electricity system. On Friday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan briefed him that one of the lines in Mozambique that supplied Eskom with power was about to go back online.  Ramaphosa said load shedding would soon be a thing of the past as the line would be able to produce 900 megawatts per hour. Cyclone Idai damaged power lines that supply Eskom with electricity from the Cahora Basa dam in Mozambique. Meanwhile, Ramaphosa says law enforcement agencies are probing allegations of possible sabotage of some Eskom plants in Gauteng following the recent power outages which have rocked the country. Ramaphosa was speaking to journalists while on the campaign trail around the Cape Flats. “The suggestion of sabotage has been made and the investigation are underway and at the same time, we got to stabilise the grid. Fortunately, the Minister of Public Enterprises has reported that they were able to recover and restore the power line from  Macarabasa. So we will be able to bring up the 900 megawatts. At the same time, they are able to bring up the other one and he is there and he staying there the whole day and we are looking through the technical team that we have appointed and all other stations to see if they are strong enough to see the extent, if they are able to take us forward,” says Ramaphosa.
