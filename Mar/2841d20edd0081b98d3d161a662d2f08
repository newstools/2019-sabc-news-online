Microsoft’s first data centres in Africa have been opened in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Called Microsoft Azure, it aims to help drive investment and significant growth in line with both the continent’s digital transformation objectives and the realisation of new economic opportunities. Microsoft South Africa’s Managing Director, Lillian Barnard, explains how this affects ordinary South Africans and business: “Azure gives organisations the ability to build digital businesses at scale.
