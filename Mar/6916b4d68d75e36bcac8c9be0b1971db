The Democratic Alliance(DA) in Limpopo is calling for the disbandment of the Vhembe district municipality following the VBS scandal. The district municipality has incurred more than R1 billion in wasteful and fruitless expenditure. It’s one of the municipalities which had invested heavily in the now liquidated VBS mutual bank where it had deposited more than R300 million. Vhembe district authorities have promised to comment later. DA leader Jacques Smalle says service delivery is being compromised. He says, “It’s clear that not only were politicians involved in the maladministration but officials were also involved. We are seeking that the municipality must urgently be placed under Section 139 where the powers and functions are taken over by government. We cannot allow more than one million people to be negatively affected due to maladministration.” Related Video
