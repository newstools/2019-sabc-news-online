The ashes of Nobuhle Bhengu have been buried in uMlazi, Durban. This after her family failed to have her body repatriated from the Bahamas to South Africa. Bhengu, who died from an infectious disease, had been working on a cruise liner. Lengthy repatriation negotiations between the South African and Bahamas governments failed, forcing her family to agree to have Bhengu’s body cremated in the Bahamas. Her sister Mbali says it has been a long, painful process. “Today, we are finally saying our final goodbye. We are finally saying rest in peace. We are finally laying you on your place of rest. Everything has been so painful from the day one. We heard she has passed away. It was so painful. We are finally saying goodbye. (We) are very grateful to everyone who had helped us from day one until today,” says Mbali.
