In a move to boost SA’s tourism, the department of home affairs has finally rectified the contradictory advisory on the dropping of the requirement for foreign minors travelling to South Africa. Speaking on SAfm’s Sunrise, CEO of the Tourism Business Council of South Africa Tshifhiwa Tshivengwa says, two parents travelling to South Africa with their children only need to carry normal travel documents. He says they do not need to carry any other documentation provided surnames are the same. He says they have welcomed the clarification as it had been long overdue. “This is an important step as the requirement that minors present birth certificates upon arrival in the country had put a strain on tourism,” says Tshivengwa. Requirements for South African kids travelling abroad have however not changed. They still require the unabridged birth certificates which must have the names of both parents.
