The Economic Freedom Fighters says it still hopes to remove the Mayor of Ekhuruhleni, Mzwandile Masina, should the opportunity present itself. The African National Congress in Ekurhuleni and one of the party’s coalition partners and its African Independent Congress‘s relationship has been on shaky ground after the metro’s Chief Operations Officer Lesiba Mojapelo was found in an Special Investigating Unit report to have awarded a tender irregularly. The tender worth R4 million was awarded to TS Records to market the city council’s 2010 World Cup activities. The AIC has since called for the removal of the metro’s COO. “There is a COO in that municipality, who is always engaged in some shenanigans. The EFF have tried to remove that COO. The mayor is defending that COO has serious allegations against him in some report of the SIU. And secondly, there were reports that he was in some corruption where he was claiming to build some roads or parks,” says EFF leader Julius Malema.
