Eskom Board Chairperson Jabu Mabuza has reassured South Africans that the power utility will ensure effective communication in order to keep the country abreast regarding future loadshedding plans. Mabuza blamed aging infrastructure for Eskom’s woes. “We understand the inconvenience and the pain that it’s causing the people. We do need time with the equipment that has not been done over the last 5-years, given the aging of our plant which is aging for 38-years. We will be coming back in days to explain what it is that we are going to and how long will it take so that they can plan knowing what the schedule is.” On Tuesday, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Mabuza briefed the media in Johannesburg about the loadshedding crisis. The country has experienced Stage 4 loadshedding for five days in a row as Eskom continues to battle a shortage of capacity. Mabuza also stressed the importance of addressing power utility challenges speedily. “We do understand we need time, but not only time because speed is of essence. Now we need to respond in an emergency way to address these. Firstly, we had to acknowledge that our communication could have been better, we are committing ourselves from today in a spirit of being fully  transparent that we are intending to stay in that course to make sure we provide accurate, timeous and reliable information about how we are going forward.” Click on video below:
