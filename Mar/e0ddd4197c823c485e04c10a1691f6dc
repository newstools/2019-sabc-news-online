The National Taxi Alliance (NTA) says it’s reached a breakthrough in its negotiations with the Nancefield Dube West Taxi Association (Nanduwe) and Witwatersrand Taxi Association (Wata). The two have finally reached an agreement on how they will be operating in Dube and White City. They’re awaiting a response from Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi. The agreement follows a week of violence in Soweto that left six people injured. Gauteng Transport threatened a 90-day shutdown of routes and ranks. A proposal has been sent to the MEC with the terms of agreement. National Taxi Alliance General Secretary, Alpheus Mlalazi says: On Monday, we managed to get a breakthrough which we have communicated with the MEC of Transport and we are grateful that the MEC has agreed to extend the period in which he was intending to close the ranks to give us a chance to continue with negotiations. We are waiting for the MEC to come back to us to indicate if he agrees or disagrees with the proposals we have put forward.” Mlalazi added: “On Wednesday, we will be sitting with three directories from Transport to look into those proposals in order to come up with a lasting solution to the problem.” Watch related video below for more on the  story:
