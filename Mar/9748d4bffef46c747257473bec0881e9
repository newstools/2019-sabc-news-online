Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, does not rule out the possibility of forming a coalition agreement with other parties should there be no party receive an outright majority during the May general elections. Maimane was on a campaign trail in UMlazi Township south of Durban.  It was a jovial day for the DA as they go house to house in the township pleading with the voters to vote for their party.  Maimane was flanked by two NFP members in the national assembly, Maliyakhe Shelembe and Scelo Mabika. Both former NFP leaders have since jumped ship and joined the DA and they appear in the party’s list to the National Assembly. Speaking during his campaign trail in the area, Maimane said his party is open to enter into a coalition with any party should no party get an outright majority. “Let’s agree on the plan let us agree on the principle of non-racialism when we agree on those things then we will work with people who are committed to those things. We will never work with parties that is racist or the part that does not want to uphold the rule of law or wants to advance corruption.” Maimane believes the party support in the province is growing and he is optimistic that the DA will do well both in the province and nationally. “We are the only party that can grow in KZN we want to be able to form a government here in KZN our numbers are indication growth here in KZN we are the only party that can bring change,” says Maimane . Some of the people who interacted with Maimane told him about their plight including lack of jobs and housing shortage in the township.
