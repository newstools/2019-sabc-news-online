Police say the assault began when two explosions were set off near the ministries of public works and labour. Gunmen entered the buildings after the blasts. Security forces have rescued many of the staff from the buildings and they are still engaging some gunmen who managed to enter the building after the blast. It’s not clear if there are any deaths in the attack. Militant group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the attack.
