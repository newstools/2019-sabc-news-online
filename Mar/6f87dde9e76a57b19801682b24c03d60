Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the suspects behind the murder of actor, Sibusiso Khwinana, have been identified. Khwinana died last Friday night after he was stabbed for a cellphone outside a cinema in Pretoria. He played a lead role in the movie Matwetwe. A memorial service for the actor is being held on Thursday at the AFM Hilltop centre in Soshanguve. Makhura says three suspects have been identified and police are working to arrest them. “I want to say to the criminals who are out there, we are coming for you. These guys must be put behind bars. Three suspects have already been identified and must be put behind bars. We will go everywhere and we want people in the community to cooperate with the police. I know that when we do these roadblocks there are inconveniences and people often get to work late but we will find them. The police are following these three suspects and we want them to be sentenced to long-term imprisonment,” says Makhura. Watch related video below for more on the story
