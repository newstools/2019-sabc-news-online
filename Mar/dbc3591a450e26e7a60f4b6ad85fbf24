Comair which operates British Airways and Kulula has announced that it’s removing its Boeing 737 MAX Eight aircraft from its schedule in South Africa. This after an Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet, bound for Nairobi, crashed minutes after take-off killing 157 people on board. The airline says it decided to temporarily not schedule flights while it consults with other operators. SA Flyer Magazine Editor, Guy Leitch says: “I don’t think it will sink Boeing as it is potentially a software glitch.” “The 737, or narrow bodies are hugely important to Boeing as they are to Airbus, but it is a problem that can be solved over time. The question is what do we do about it now, do the airlines continue to fly? Some are doing so and some are being more prudent and grounding the fleet.” Related Videos
