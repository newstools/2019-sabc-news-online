Provincial Minister for Local Government, Anton Bredell has called on municipalities in the Western Cape to manage the water supply better in their areas of responsibility. The water level for dams stands at about 40%, compared to 20% at the same time in 2018. Bredell says concern remains, regarding some municipalities in the Karoo that are facing a dire water situation. “The Theewaterskloof Dam was last year this time 10% full and rapidly emptying further at the moment. That dam, the biggest in the province, is at 40.8% full. We remain concerned, of course, about some region. This is primarily in the Karoo region in the Western Cape where several small towns are still under severe water restrictions and we want to continue to urge people to use water responsibly,” says Western Cape Local Government Ministry Spokesperson, James Styan.
