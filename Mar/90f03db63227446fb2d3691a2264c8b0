Standard Bank’s Ian Sinton has told the State Capture commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that the bank became suspicious of a number of large cash deposits from Transnet into Regiments Capital’s account. Regiment was a company owned by Gupta Associate, Salim Essa and Mohamed Bobat. Sinton says what was also suspicious was the significant funds transferred from Regiments to a company called Chivita Trading. Sinton says Regiments had built a reputation as the black owned adviser of choice to most state-owned companies. Earlier the Commission set aside a request from Regiments’ lawyers to postpone Sinton’s testimony for 30 days.
