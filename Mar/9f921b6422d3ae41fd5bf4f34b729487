The bail application of Soweto-born rapper Thulani Ngcobo, who is popularly known as Pitch Black Afro, is expected to resume in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday morning. Ngcobo is charged with the murder of his wife Catherine Modisane at a Bed and Breakfast accommodation in Yeoville, Johannesburg on New Year’s eve. He also faces a charge of defeating the ends of justice. The rapper allegedly concealed evidence related to the blood found at the scene of the murder from the police. Ngcobo has already spent almost three months behind bars. Last month, his bail application was postponed after a pathologist who was due to testify on the injuries sustained by Modisane failed to show up in court. The court has since subpoenaed the pathologist, who is expected to testify on Thursday.
