President Cyril Ramaphosa’s son Andile says he regrets the deal with corruption-accused company, Bosasa in which he was paid R2 million. He has described the deal as a severe oversight. In an exclusive interview with News 24, the President’s son says there were glaring red flags he claims to have missed before putting pen to paper. In December 2017, his company Blue Crane Capital signed an advisory mandate with Bosasa, resulting in it receiving a monthly retainer fee of R150 000, which was later increased to R230 000. News24 investigative journalist Kyle Cowan spoke on SAFM’s current show Sunrise about his interaction with Andile. He says: “We do understand now that the most likely move for the donation to Cyril’s campaign was stemming from this relationship between Andile and Bosasa. Their relationship starts in April 2017, by October the donation and then December 10 days before Nasrec they find an advisory mandate that’s very clear. We understand now how Bosasa came to President Ramaphosa’s doorstep.” “This is something that Andile himself has realised and he said in retrospect, I should have been far more careful, I should have done more due diligence it was a severe oversight considering my father’s role going into the presidency.” Listen below for full interview <a href="https://iono.fm/e/670018">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
