Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has expressed concern about the calibre of some learners in the province’s schools. He says he is pained that he has to comfort the family of a learner because his life has been taken by other learners. Lesufi was speaking at a memorial service for 19-year-old Kulani Mathebula from Mondeor High School who was stabbed to death on Wednesday on his way to school. Three teenage boys aged 13 and 15 have been arrested for Mathebula’s murder and have appeared in court. The Grade 11 learner will be laid to rest in Malamulele in Limpopo on Sunday. Lesufi says, “Instead of issuing a report card to the family, I’m giving them a death certificate. Here we are as society mourning because those that we thought were the future are showing signs that are completely unacceptable. If learners can commit such horrendous deeds, they desist to be called learners and acquire new names.” Related video below
