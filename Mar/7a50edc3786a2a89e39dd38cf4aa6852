The case against Gugu Ncube, the woman who staged a protest while half naked in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria, has been postponed to the 10th April for further investigation. She was granted free bail. She briefly appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on a charge of public indecency. Ncube wanted to highlight her plight regarding the sexual harassment incident she allegedly endured from a colleague at Unisa’s Centre for Early Childhood Education. She has accused her employer of failing to investigate a colleague who allegedly harassed her sexually last year. Meanwhile, Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela says the university doesn’t have any jurisdiction over the matter. He says the centre is an independent entity.
