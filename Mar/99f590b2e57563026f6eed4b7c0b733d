The Democratic Alliance(DA) is to approach the new National Director for Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Advocate Shamila Batohi, to lay charges of racketeering against the ANC. Briefing the media in parliament, party leader Mmusi Maimane said recent revelations on issues such as State Capture are symptoms of a political entity that ought to be charged with racketeering and be prosecuted. He says the ANC has used its political links with various businesses to amass financial advantages. Maimane says crimes of fraud, corruption, money laundering, racketeering fall under the prevention of corrupt activities of organised crime Act 121 of 1998 “We believe that the ANC must face prosecution. We are therefore calling for a break from this current modus operandi. We will proceed and lay charges and ensure that those who are in the ANC must be rendered in such a way that it is charged and faces prosecution,” says Maimane.
