The National Assembly is debating the renaming of Cape Town International Airport after the late struggle stalwart, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. EFF leader Julius Malema will table the motion. The party says due to the contribution Madikizela-Mandela made to the liberation of the country the airport should be renamed after her.
