The National Assembly has endorsed the decision not to renew Robert McBride‘s contract. The Portfolio Committee on Police earlier proposed not renewing his IPID contract. McBride was IPID’s executive director. Even before Parliament stepped in, Police Minister Bheki Cele decided not to renew the contract. The National Assembly voted to support the decision with 172 votes against five which wanted McBride to keep his job. Although McBride has taken the Portfolio Committee’s decision on judicial review, this has not stopped Parliament from endorsing his exit. Police Committee Chair Francois Beukman says:” It must be put on record that the committee carefully considered all the submissions, the committee concluded that the appointment of the head of IPID should not be renewed for a further term.” DA MP Dianne Kohler Barnard says:” What we sat through and witnessed was a political party turning on one of its own on the orders of the minister which it is supposed to exercise.” EFF MP Nazier Paulsen says:”Robert McBride’s history as a liberation struggle hero does not entitle him to any position in government, the position of executive director for IPID is for five years and it is disingenuous of McBride to think that he is entitled, there are other good candidates who will do the same good job.” Click video below:
