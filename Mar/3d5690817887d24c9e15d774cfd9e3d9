Germany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier , on Thursday said the European Union (EU) should “constructively” discuss the question of a potential delay of Britain’s departure from the bloc and that he would not set “artificial” limits in doing so. “I would not set any artificial boundaries here”, Altmaier, a close ally of Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, told public radio BR. “We urgently need clarity, we need clarity fast, but we will not make this by always criticising our British friends and partners from a high moral standpoint, but only if we reach a reasonable solution,” he added. The British parliament on Wednesday rejected leaving the European Union without a deal and is due to vote on the issue of postponing the Brexit deadline, originally planned for March 29, on Thursday.
