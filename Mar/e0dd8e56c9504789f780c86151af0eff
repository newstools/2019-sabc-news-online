The South African Revenue Services (SARS) has confirmed that they have placed a new offer on the table in the latest wage negotiations with unions National Health Education & Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) and the Public Servants Association of SA (PSA) in Pretoria Saturday night. Details of the new offer are expected to be released soon. This, after members affiliated to the unions embarked on a strike on Thursday last week. SARS had offered a 7% increase which was rejected by members. Workers are demanding, among others, an 11% increase. There is still uncertainty about whether the strike action will be suspended for the coming week. Earlier unions say they will continue with the strike – despite ongoing salary negotiations. The strike began on Thursday.
