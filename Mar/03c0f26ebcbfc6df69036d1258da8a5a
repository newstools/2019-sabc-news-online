The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called on its alliance partner, the African National Congress, to rein in Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. This is after Mboweni lashed out at the roads agency South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) for its decision to suspend pursuing legal action against those who refused to pay for e-tolls in Gauteng. Cosatu’s Gauteng chairperson Amos Monyela says Mboweni’s utterances are counter-productive. “The Finance Minister has got a big mouth, has verbal diarrhoea. Ever since he became a Finance Minister, he has brought things which are against the working class and the poor and public servants in this country, therefore, we are going to call all our members, if anybody will be taken to court, we’ll be in the stand with them. We are calling for civil disobedience on this one on the basis of the utterances of the Finance Minister. ” Click below for more on the story:
