The funeral of 89-year old Princess Irene Thandekile MaMzila Buthelezi is underway in Ulundi. Prince Mangosuthu  Buthelezi and the family arrived together with the hearse carrying the body of Princess Irene. Princess Irene died on Monday after a long illness. President Cyril Ramaphosa is attending the funeral. Amongst the mourners are also political leaders, a delegation from the household of the King of the AmaZulu, Goodwill Zwelithini, a delegation from the household of the King of Amaswazi, and IFP members. Speaking at the Ulundi Stadium in northern KwaZulu-Natal ahead of the funeral of Prince Buthelezi’s wife – Princess Irene Thandekile MaMzila, IFP Treasurer General Narend Singh says Buthelezi – had a very loving relationship with his late wife. Singh said Prince Buthelezi would buy roses for his wife every Valentines Day and wedding anniversary. “She did a lot in the background and that’s why I say sometimes we underestimate the role of partners who quietly continue with other chores which would have been the responsibility of the one partner. For example in my own case my wife takes care of the family and everything else, she keeps the home fire burning, understanding fully that we are available 24/7 hours a day, 365 days to the public. And that we can be called at any time to serve a community needs. For that you need a very understanding partner whether it be male or female and Princess Irene Buthelezi who has been in the background has been that very firm, but strong, understanding loving and caring partner.” Prince Buthelezi and Princess Irene have been married for close to 67 years. They had eight children, five daughters and three sons. Princess Irene is survived by her husband and three children. Watch a related video below:
