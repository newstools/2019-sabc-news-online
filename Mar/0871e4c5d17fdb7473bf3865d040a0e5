A patient in London has become the second person ever to be seemingly cured of HIV in the world. The news comes 12 years after the Berlin patient was also cleared of HIV. Announcing the news, scientists say the London case received a bone marrow transplant from a virus-resistant donor three years ago. Eighteen months after stopping his anti-retroviral the virus is still not detectable. Professor Salim Abdul-Karim of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, Caprisa says this is an interesting development in AIDS research. He says they hope the man stays negative for a long time. Professor Abdul-Karim says this is an early step in search for a cure. “But we are nowhere near a cure. The research is all part of a process that eventually may lead to something of a cure in many years from now, but right now it has no direct implication or meaning regarding having a cure available in SA anytime soon,” says Abdul-Karim.
