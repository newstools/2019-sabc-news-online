The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Tuesday hear more evidence relating to African Global Operations, formerly known as Bosasa. The company’s former auditor, Peet Venter, is set to give evidence. Venter’s name was first raised at the commission in January during the evidence of former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer Angelo Agrizzi. On Monday, commission chair Justice Raymond Zondo expressed frustration at the Free State government’s failure to provide crucial information to former Finance MEC Mxolisi Dukwana, whose testimony has been rescheduled to April. “I have directed that arrangements be made with the provincial government to make it possible for the investigators of the commission members and the legal team of the commission, a member of Mr. Dukwana’s legal team to all converge on a date that will be agreed in Bloemfontein for purposes of making sure that before the end of this week the information is released to the commission.”
