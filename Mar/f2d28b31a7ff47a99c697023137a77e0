Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane goes on trial on two charges of culpable homicide in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. This after his car rammed into a taxi, killing passengers, Phumzile Dube and Nanki Mashaba in 2014. Between 10 and 12 state witnesses are expected be called to testify. Five years after the fatal accident, Duduzane Zuma will finally have his day in court.  A maximum of three people is expected to take the witness box on day 1, of which SABC NEWS understands are all male. The taxi driver behind the wheel on that fateful day in February 2014 is likely to be one of the state witnesses. The National Prosecuting Authority had initially declined to charge Zuma but reviewed the decision after AfriForum announced plans to pursue a private prosecution. Advocate Gerrie Nel says, “The family approached AFriforum and they will proceed with a private prosecution.” An inquest in the same year of the accident found that Zuma had been negligent. It remains to be seen if the former President Jacob Zuma will again be side-by-side with his son. The media have been granted permission to film inside the court, but only before and after court proceedings. Click link below for more on the story:
