Cosatu has reiterated the need for female empowerment in the economy. The labour federation’s president Zingiswa Losi says they are concerned about qualified women who get job opportunities after exchanging sexual favours at the workplace. She was speaking during the commemoration of International Women’s Day in Bethlehem in the Eastern Free State. “The issue on the table is violence and harassment against men and women. We understand some women with qualification but they have to exchange sex (sic). It’s still an issue to continue to pursue,” says Losi.
