The Bertha Gxowa Hospital in Germiston, east of Johannesburg, has reportedly had to cancel major operations and divert patients to other hospitals due to a lack of water supply. The hospital has been without water for a number of days now. It’s alleged that the problem is with a faulty water valve and the Ekurhuleni Municipality has sent tankers to fill the hospital reservoirs. The DA’s Jack Bloom says: “I’m very concerned that this hospital has been without water for a number of days now. The Ekurhuleni municipality is not supplying enough water tanks and the hospital is suffering.” “They have had to cancel operations and divert patients from maternity and casualty. How can you have a hospital without water, its going to lead to hygiene hazards and risks to patients.”
