Police in KwaZulu-Natal have arrested 15 people in connection with violent protests in Mandeni on the north coast of the province. Protesters brought the town to a standstill, demanding the immediate resignation of the Mandeni municipal mayor â€“ Sphesihle Zulu. They are accusing Zulu of corruption and standing in the way of the provision of services. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thulani Zwane says the number of factories that were burnt stands at five with more than a dozen retail shops vandalised and looted throughout the week. Police are still in the area monitoring the situation.
