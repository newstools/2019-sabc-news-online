An African National Congress (ANC) Mayor from one of the municipalities in southern KwaZulu-Natal will not be appearing in court on Monday as anticipated, but will now appear on Tuesday. The ANC mayor was arrested on Sunday by the police’s national task team investigating political killings in the province. The senior party leader in the province is believed to be linked to the murder of former ANCYL Secretary General Sindiso Magaqa in 2017. Dozens of heavily armed police officers have been deployed inside and outside uMzimkhulu Magistrate Court in southern KwaZulu-Natal. Meanwhile, a group of people – some wearing T-shirts bearing the face of Magaqa are standing outside court. Click video below:
