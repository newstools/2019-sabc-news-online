A 27-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping an 18-year-old student in the Johannesburg CBD. Police spokesperson Xoli Mbele says after the crime, the suspect left money for the victim and told her to buy something to eat. “The victim was relaxing in her room when she heard a knock at the door. A man came inside and asked for her roommate and she replied that she was not around. The suspect locked the door where he raped her. After he finished, he apologised and left R70 on the table and old her to go buy pizza. The investigation is underway and the suspect arrested will appear soon in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court.”
