The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has announced that the academic programme on four of its campuses has been suspended until further notice. The suspension came into effect at the end of last week after protests on the Howard College, Westville and Edgewood campuses in Durban, as well as the Pietermaritzburg campus. University spokesperson, Indu Moodley, says that the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine will not be affected. Protesting students are calling for funding for 700 poor postgraduates who allegedly did not receive funding from the university. Other grievances include Wi-Fi access and security at accommodation that is being leased off-campus. University management plans to meet student leaders on Monday.
