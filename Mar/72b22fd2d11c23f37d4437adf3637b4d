Former Cabinet Spokesperson, Mzwanele Manyi, who is now the Policy Chief of a new political party, the African Transformation Movement (ATM) says coloured people have forgiven him for his past disparaging remarks. Manyi met with community leaders from Elsie’s river in Cape Town, where he apologized for saying there was an over-supply of coloured people in the Western Cape and that they must be prepared to relocate for jobs. He made the remarks in 2011 while he was the Labour Department Director-General. Manyi says his apology has been accepted. “I had said that coloured people must understand that they own the entire country, they must not locate themselves only in one spot. People here have understood that I was quoted out of context. They’ve embraced me. I’m getting hugs and kisses.” Click below for more on  ATM:
