The  African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape says it has received a letter of resignation from former Transport MEC, Thandiswa Marawu who later announce her move to join the African Transformation Movement (ATM) on Monday. She joined the ANC in the 70’s as a member of the party’s student movement. She was until recently the Women’s League top structure. Marawu says factionalism within the ruling party is her reason for dumping it for the newly formed ATM. After more than 30 years with the ruling party, she signed a new membership form with the ATM. “I’m here to join the ATM. It has been a long time, it is long overdue. It is not a mistake at all. I’m here because of the values of the ATM. You may see us wearing the ANC regalia, looking at us thinking we are happy. you may be surprised that about 60% of the total membership are not at all happy.” Marawu says she is happy that she was able to serve people of the Eastern Cape when she served at two departments until she was reshuffled last year. “When I arrived at the department of transport, there was no administration at all. It was in tators. There were problems of traffic officers, lots of problems that were existing there. At least I managed to address a number of the administrative problems. There was no scholar transport. I was the only MEC that managed to out scholar transport on the road.” Eastern Cape ATM chairperson and Premier candidate Veliswa Mvenya, says her party is confident for a take over in government after the general elections. “It is growing. If you can check the progress since June last year’s the progress of growth you can just see that we are going to be in power on the 9th of May. We are attracting members, we are not only attracting members from other political parties we are also attracting churches. Churches with big numbers. They are all buying into our values as ATM. So I am very confident.”
