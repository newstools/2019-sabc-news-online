GOOD party leader Patricia De Lille has taken her election campaign to Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape where she will officially announce the party’s premier candidate Celeste Domingo. Addressing the residents of Malabar community, De Lille said she was confident that Domingo would ensure a clean provincial government. “I believe that women must be given the opportunity to come and fight for the rights of other women, but she is also capable and got the experience in government and she is well known in Port Elizabeth and she also has a clear record and it is also the young people I want to bring in and give them the exposure. And I will be there just to mentor and train, but it is also an opportunity for women to come forward because if women rise the nation will rise.” Since its inception in December 2018, the organisation says it has recruited 60 000 members across the country with a strong contingent coming from Gauteng. Eastern Cape GOOD party Eastern Cape premier candidate Celeste Domingo says it is important to mobilise the youth in order groom future leaders. “When you are looking for youth you need to be where they are and you need to actively participate in their activities and sport is where we are going to find them. So, we need go to those sport fields. We need to constantly monitor them and become involved and interested in what they are going through and supporting their activities and getting them to take on those leadership roles because we can’t always baby the youth. They need to step forward now and take over this particular movement,” says Domingo.
