Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that he did not disclose threats by Ajay Gupta to the Public Protector because at the time he did not trust anyone. Jonas is continuing to give evidence at the Commission underway in Johannesburg. He previously detailed in his testimony how one of the Gupta brothers had threatened him, if he did not cooperate with their demands. Jonas says his first comprehensive statement was with the Commission. He has admitted to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that some aspects of his statement to the public protector are wrong. He is being cross examined by former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma’s legal representative, Piet Louw. Louw has questioned the former deputy finance minister why he would allow a statement with errors be submitted to the public protector. Watch related video below for more on the story:
