The Good Party founded by former Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille says it will use Human Rights Day celebrations to highlight women’s rights. The party says it is shocking that in the new democracy women and girls’ rights are still undermined. The party says South Africa’s rate of Femicide is five times more than the global average. On 21 March, 59 years ago, the apartheid government shot and killed 69 people in Sharpeville who were protesting against pass laws. De Lille says those who died in 1960 were fighting for human rights. “Now it’s also time to reflect on the failure of our new rights based democracy to protect our women and children from violence and from poverty, feminisation of today every second day a woman is killed it’s a stain on our democracy.”
