Thereâ€™s been an outbreak of African Horse Sickness in Gauteng and Mpumalanga. African horse sickness is a highly infectious and deadly disease caused by a virus. It commonly affects horses, mules, and donkeys. The disease is transmitted by flying insects and therefore makes restriction of horse movement less effective in controlling the disease. Last year, about 110 cases of African Horse Sickness were reported in the country compared to about 50 the previous year. Currently, there are no official statistics on the reported outbreak. The Department of Agriculture has called on owners to take reasonable steps to protect their animals and prevent the disease from spreading.
