The SABC is expected back in Parliament to appear before the Communications Committee about its turnaround strategy on Tuesday. The Committee is also expected to finalise issues around the removal of ICASA Chairperson Reuben Mohlaloga who was sentenced to 20-years imprisonment for fraud. The SABC will brief the Committee about the public broadcasterâ€™s progress made on the turnaround strategy, labour matters and the implementation of the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the SABC Board Inquiry of 2016. The meeting with the SABC comes at a time when the Committee is still expected to have deliberation on the SABC Board candidates to fill eight vacancies.
