The South African Weather Services says Cyclone Idai, which has made landfall in Mozambique, will not affect KwaZulu-Natal in any way. Heavy rains have already claimed over a hundred lives since the beginning of the week in Mozambique and Malawi. The weather services have issued a watch for heavy showers and thundershowers over the western part of the province. The Harry Gwala and Mgungundlovu districts are predicted to be heavily affected. South African Weather service forecaster, Ayanda Nsele says KZN will only experience the afternoon thunderstorms, but it has nothing to do with the tropical storm. “Over the weekend we are expecting some showers and thunder showers over the western part of KZN. At this point we dont have an alert out for the weekend but we do have a watch for severe storms for the far Western parts of KZN for today so the areas that will affected are Harry Gwala and Umgungundlovu.” Watch a related video below:
