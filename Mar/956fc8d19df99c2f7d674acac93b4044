Parliament’s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee has found that former Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba‘s approval of the early naturalisation of the Gupta family was fraudulent. The Committee has concluded its investigation into the naturalisation of the controversial Gupta family. It says that the Guptas did not comply with the requirements to renounce their Indian citizenship. It recommends that criminal charges be taken against the Guptas and intermediary Ashu Chawla for falsifying naturalisation citizenship. The committee also recommends that Chawla’s South African citizenship be revoked. The Chairperson of Parliament’s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee, Hlomani Chauke, says the documents submitted by Chawla were fraudulent. “It was confirmed in the meeting that there was a relationship to an extent where officials were able to share confidential information of the state with Chawla,” says Chauke. Chauke has recommended that Chawla and some members of the Gupta family be criminally charged. Watch the full interview below:
