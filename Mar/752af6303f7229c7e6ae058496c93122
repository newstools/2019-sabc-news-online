Former Sport and Recreation Minister, Fikile Mbalula has described as “cowardly” the African National Congress (ANC) NEC’s reaction at the infamous August 2011 meeting. This after he told them that he had received a call from Ajay Gupta, congratulating him before he was appointed as minister. Testifying at the State Capture Commission, on Friday, Mbalula detailed the call, as well as several later meetings with the Gupta brothers. He confirmed his emotional outburst at the NEC meeting. Mbalula says no one showed any support when he raised the matter. He confirmed that former President Jacob Zuma was also present. Mbalula says the NEC did not discuss the issue of the Gupta family’s influence on Zuma and the party leadership. He however denied being inconsistent when he did not tell former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela about the call from Ajay Gupta. Wearing his hat as ANC Head of Elections, Mbalula says he does not believe the revelations at the Commission will hurt the party at the polls. ANC president defends the party’s list Meanwhile, the  ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has defended the party’s list which contains names of possible members of parliament and the provincial legislatures saying it reflects the ANC’s internal democracy. However, Ramaphosa says those who are implicated in wrongdoing will have to account. The ANC has come under fire after it transpired that its list of possible members of parliament after the May election contains the names of people like Nomvula Mokonyana, Malusi Gigaba and other members who have been implicated in corruption at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.
