The criminalisation of sex work contributes to the exceptionally high levels of gender based violence, rape and murder of the women involved. That is according to members of the National Movement of Sex Workers in South Africa who made the comments during a protest march in Durban, to coincide with commemoration of International Sex Workers Rights Day. Organisation spokesperson Sindi Mfeka says they want to be recognised like any other worker. Mfeka has also called for swift justice for to perpetrators of crimes against sex workers . “So… we are celebrating the international sex workers human rights day. Its celebrated all over the world; we are advocating for change in the current law – that is what is happening in South Africa because sex workers are killed on a daily basis – and we are pleading with the government to change laws, we want to tell our story.” “There is this Sam Lee case happening on the 11th (March). She was brutally killed in Durban and burnt beyond recognition. That’s why we are fighting for them. Sex workers are also human beings, before I am a sex worker I am a human being and got families to feed. My body should not cost me my life,” Mfeka adds.  Click below for more:
