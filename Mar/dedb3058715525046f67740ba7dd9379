US President Donald Trump will host his close ally Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House next week, Trump’s spokeswoman said Wednesday. A working meeting will be held on Monday, with a dinner for the two leaders on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. “The president and the prime minister will discuss their countries’ shared interests and actions in the Middle East,” she said. Netanyahu will be in Washington for the annual conference of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) pro-Israel lobbying group. The right-wing Israeli leader is running for reelection while facing a threat of indictment for corruption and the Trump administration is pushing hard to show support.
