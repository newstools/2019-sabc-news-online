President Cyril Ramaphosa says restoring a reliable supply of electricity is government’s top priority. This is as Eskom continues with stage four load shedding across the country. Some regions are also experiencing water shortages as load shedding contributes to infrastructure failures. Ramaphosa says he is confident that the country will overcome the electricity crisis. “We are currently facing a severe energy crisis that is having a profound impact on the lives of our people and also on our economy. Restoring a reliable supply of energy and ensuring that we have a sustainable model of affordable energy in the future is one of our most urgent priorities. We will overcome this electricity crisis that is engulfing our country at this moment.”  Ramaphosa says government has embraced a culture of human rights and is slowly making the country a better place to live in for people with disability. He was speaking at the national Human Rights Day Commemorations at the George Thabe sports ground in Sharpeville, Gauteng. This year’s commemoration took place under the theme – The Year of Indigenous Languages: Promoting and Deepening a Human Rights Culture. The objective is to amplify efforts to preserve, promote, and revitalise endangered languages. Ramaphosa says his government will soon make signing the 12th official language. He also highlighted the importance of growing the economy to enable the youth to get jobs. He says government is working hard to ensure that young people exercise their right to earn a living. “Our children don’t get jobs. The right to work is an important right that we would like to see fulfilled for our people and we are working day and night to make sure this very important right in the lives of our people is fulfilled and we are going to make progress in this regard as well. So long as one section of the population enjoys some or all of these rights while the others remain unfulfilled, we will never be a society that is united.” WATCH BELOW:
