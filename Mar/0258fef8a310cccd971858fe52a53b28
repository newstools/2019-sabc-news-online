President Cyril Ramaphosa is answering oral questions on Thursday in the National Assembly for the last time in the fifth Parliament. The general elections are set to take place on May 8 after which the sixth Parliament will be elected. Meanwhile, ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says the party’s caucus in Parliament has learnt from its mistakes and has vowed it will never repeat them. Mthembu was briefing the media following the last caucus meeting of the party and the address by its president Cyril Ramaphosa. This comes amid a new survey that indicates that the ANC may get around 55% of the national vote in the May 8th general elections. Mthembu has admitted that they should have acted differently during the Nkandla scandal where the party stood steadfast in its support of former President Jacob Zuma. He says the party has stuck to the resolutions of its 2016 Caucus Lekgotla where it vowed never to do anything illegal again. “In the 5 years, yes, there were difficult times, but of course, we are just human. We have committed errors and the errors that we have committed, we are very my sorry. But a commitment we made is that we will not repeat those mistakes as the Parliament of the Republic of South African whether in the 6th Parliament in the 7th Parliament, because we have learned from our own mistakes.
