The Dean of Engineering at the Stellenbosch University, Wikus van Niekerk, says South Africans should be encouraged to generate their own electricity rather than placing increased pressure on an already strained national power grid. Eskom has said that it was engaging with businesses to help them use electricity more efficiently. Van Niekerk says, “There is not a lot of scope in South Africa to reduce the amount of electricity that either residential areas, commercial areas or industrial areas are using.” He adds: “On the other hand it’s possible for smart consumers to start generating their own electricity, thereby still using the same electricity that they do in their house. Instead of demanding electricity from the grid, they can generate their own electricity.  This is typically done by putting photobill tape panels on their roof.” Watch a related video below:
