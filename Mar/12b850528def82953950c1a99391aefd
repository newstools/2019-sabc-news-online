A 31-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping and killing an 8-year-old girl as well as the attempted rape of another girl and that of an elderly woman. The murdered girl had gone missing two weeks ago at Mkhuze in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Mayor Solomon Mkhombo says the man allegedly tried to rape another 10 -year-old girl, but was disturbed. Mkhombo says he was then apprehended by the community when he attempted to rape an elderly woman who was cleaning at a church. “And a scuffle broke out where he tried to rape the old lady, but the lady fought back hitting the assailant with the spade, but the assailant managed to poke two eyes of this lady. As we speak, the lady has lost her sight. So we’re calling upon the law enforcement agents to continue pursuing and investigating the man because we believe that he can shed some light into a number of serious cases which are unresolved as yet.” Police spokesperson, Thulani Zwane says the suspect is expected to appear at the Obonjeni Magistrate’s Court in Umkhuze, facing charges of murder. “When the police interviewed him it appeared that he took he took the police to where he allegedly killed the 8 year old and dumped her in the bushes. Her body was then found and it was confirmed it was the same girl that was reported missing from the 3rd of March. A missing docket was opened but now it has been changed to murder. The suspect was then charged for murder and he is due to appear at Obonjeni Magistrate’s Court.”
