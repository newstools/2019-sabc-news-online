The Traditional and Khoisan Leadership Bill is a step in the right direction to address the historical grievances of the Khoi and San people. These are the sentiments of Parliament’s Co-operative Governance and Tradition Affairs Committee Chairperson Richard Mdakane. This comes as the National Assembly passed the bill and it is now expected to be signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa. One of the objectives of the Bill is to protect and promote the institutions of traditional and Khoi-San leadership. Mdakane says the legislation is a breakthrough for the Khoi and San. “Firstly it is addressing their primary grievance. Of course they always complain about land like all traditional leaders to them and like all other indigenous people land is a big issue.” “But also this Bill is of course restoring their dignity and their honour as South African people who were dispersed, who were brutalised, who culture was destroyed and their language was ignored. But now we are trying to address this historical grievance of theirs.” Related video click below:
