Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says Human Rights Day should be called Sharpeville Day. Malema was addressing the community of Sharpeville, as the country remembers all those who died for the country’s freedom. Fifty nine-years ago, 69 people lost their lives when they raised their dissatisfaction with the apartheid government’s system of pass laws. Malema says this day be commemorated as the day when the Pan Africanist Congress fought for the rights of black people. “Today is not a Human Rights Day, today is a Sharpeville Day. Today is the day we are fighting for the rights of black people, we must not make any apology about that. This nonsense of non-racialism that they are spreading in defence of white privilege, we are not part of that nonsense, today is the day of the rights of black people. “
