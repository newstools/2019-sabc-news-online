Thousands of taxi commuters in Soweto could be stranded on Monday. This as the provincial government plans to close major routes and ranks due to taxi violence. Soweto taxi associations had until Friday to motivate why their routes and ranks should not be closed. Several incidents of violence have been reported since the start of the year. Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi has threatened to shut down the routes used by the Dube West and the Witwatersrand taxi associations. There have also been several attacks on commuters. At least 5000 taxis could be affected if the MEC shuts down the routes. The department will make a decision on Monday. Click on video below:
