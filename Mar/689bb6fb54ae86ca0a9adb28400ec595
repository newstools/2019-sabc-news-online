The Witwatersrand Taxi Association’s Mandlenkosi Maphalala says the ongoing Soweto taxi violence between Nancefield Dube West and Witwatersrand Taxi Associations is about routes. Speaking on Morning Live, he says the disagreements started about four years ago. The fight between the associations has recently left three people dead and six wounded by stray bullets These rival taxi associations will now have to wait for Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi to hear about their future. Vadi had asked the Nancefield Dube West and Witwatersrand Taxi Associations to submit motivations of why their ranks and routes should not be closed. Maphala believes the way forward would be for the associations to merge and work as one. He says, “We have had agreements in the past, but these would last four or six months and the conflict would start again. So the best way would be to operate under one banner.” Watch below for more
