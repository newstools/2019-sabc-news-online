Eskom says rotational loadshedding will move up to Stage 4 from 12-noon until 11pm tonight. The power utility says this is due to loss of additional power station units, which includes a reduction in imports from Mozambique. Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi are currently experiencing bad weather conditions due to Cyclone Idai. Earlier, the power utility said the power cuts were a result of plant breakdowns. Loadshedding is estimated to cost the economy around R2 billion a day. The power utility has urged people to check their website or that of their local power supplier to see if they are affected by this weekendâ€™s loadshedding.
