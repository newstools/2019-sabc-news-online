The Bank of Lisbon building in the Joburg CBD that was damaged by fire resulting in the deaths of three firefighters last year, will be demolished. The Gauteng government says a contractor has been appointed to manage the demolition project. Three firefighters died after a fire broke out at the building which housed two Gauteng government departments. Spokesperson for the Gauteng Provincial Government, Thabo Masebe says, “After the fire incident last year, we conducted a structural assessment to determine the extent of the damage and the assessment actually revealed that the building did sustain quite serious structural damage. We then looked at various options of dealing with the issue and came to the conclusion that it would be better to actually demolish the building.” He adds: “So we are now moving ahead with the demolition process, we have now initiated all necessary steps in terms of the law, regulation and by-laws and once the plan is completed, we will be able to keep the public informed.” Click on interview below: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/663386">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
