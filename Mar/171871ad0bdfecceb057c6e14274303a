The cyclone has caused major damages in Mozambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Harare has requested for more assistance from the international community as Zimbabwe’s ambassador to South Africa David Hamadziripi explains… “We need shelter for those families who are now stranded and don’t have anywhere to go. Presently, we have very temporary shelter. We also have had some individual’s and entrepreneurs who have offered their facilities as temporary shelter for some of the homeless people. We need blankets, clothes for all age groups. We also need volunteers because we are having a massive mobilisation of support but we need volunteers to deliver these goods to where they are most needed.” Click on video below:
