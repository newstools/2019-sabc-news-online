Moody‘s Investor Services is expected to announce South Africa’s credit rating on Friday evening. The agency has the country’s credit rating at B-double-three with a stable outlook, which is investment grade. Fitch and Standard and Poor’s have both downgraded South Africa to sub-investment grade or the so-called junk status in 2015. Most analysts expect Moody’s to only lower the country’s outlook from stable to negative. That means being on watch for a downgrade in future. Whatever the decision, Moody’s will take into account the state of South Africa’s economy as well as its dim prospects for growth.
