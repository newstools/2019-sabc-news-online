The South African Communist Party’s first deputy secretary-general, Solly Mapaila, says those who have looted from Eskom, which has led to the power utility’s inability to keep the lights on, have trampled on the rights of ordinary citizens. Delivering a memorial lecture in honour of ANC stalwart J.B Marks, who was also the SACP’s chairperson in Ventersdorp in the North West province, Mapaila says the alleged looters must be brought to book. “They stole from us, there’s no doubt about it. Individuals that have violated South African’s rights, to have access to electricity, for instance, the companies that were given contracts to supply proper coal and they supplied sub-standard coal, to Eskom, which led to power stations requiring constant services, are to blame because of their greediness.”
