The State Capture Commission is expected to hear the evidence from Eskom officials, Gert Opperman and Johann Bester, on Friday morning in Parktown, Johannesburg. Earlier this week, Snehal Nagar of Eskom’s Primary Energy Division said that Eskom’s payment system had to be manipulated in order to make a controversial R600-million pre-payment to Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration and Resources. Nagar said he was instructed to effect the payment within a matter of hours of the request. Nagar said that there were no supporting documents for the request and the whole transaction went against Eskom’s procurement processes. The Commission’s evidence leader and Senior Counsel, Advocate Phillip Mokoena said that an assessment of the statement brought forward by Nagar, indicated that Eskom’s tender board committee resolved to give Tegeta the R600 million pre-payment without Tegeta ever having asked for the funds.
