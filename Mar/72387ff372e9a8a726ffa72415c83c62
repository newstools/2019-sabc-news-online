Another KwaZulu-Natal mayor has been arrested by the police task team investigating political killings in the province. The person who has been arrested is a mayor who has been in office for barely two months. The ANC says it’s deeply disappointed that another high-profile party member in KwaZulu-Natal has been taken in for questioning in connection with the ongoing investigation into political killings in the province. Earlier this week, ANC mayor in the Harry Gwala District, Mluleki Ndobe appeared in the uMzimkhulu Magistrate’s Court on a murder charge, relating to the killing of former ANC Youth League secretary-general, Sindiso Magaqa. ANC KwaZulu-Natal’s Noma Zulu says, “I cannot believe that this is happening.” National Police spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero, has confirmed the latest arrest. “I can confirm that one senior official from Emalahleni has arrested by the political task team with regard to murder and at this stage we cannot divulge the name as the suspect he/she has not appeared in court which will take place in the next 48 hours.”
