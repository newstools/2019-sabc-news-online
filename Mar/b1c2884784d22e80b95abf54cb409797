The family of murdered Mondeo High School learner Kulani Mathebula has criticised the Health Department for taking about four hours to collect Mathebula’s remains. Spokesperson for the family Mikhongelo Chauke says the family waited for four hours for forensics to arrive at the scene. The Grade 11 pupil was stabbed to death on his way to school on Wednesday. Chauke says that was a sign of total disrespect for the dead. “Why would it take 4 hours for forensics to arrive? His blood even dried up, flies were surrounding him, why? This is Johannesburg, Mondeor, this is a surburb are you telling me that it takes you 4 hours to do something so simple? I was there before the journalists got there, I was there before the MEC got there, many came and left,  Kulani was still there, this is disgusting guys, this is disgusting, it goes to show that our leaders defecate on us at will,” says Chauke.
