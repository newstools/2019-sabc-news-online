KwaZulu-Natal’s filthy capital Pietermaritzburg is getting a major clean-up with a campaign that was launched on Friday. The provincial capital is in a state of decay with refuse piling up on the streets and crime is rampant. “As a resident of this Msunduzi city, we have been very concerned on the rising littering and dirt in an around of various streets and we believe that this matter had to be taken up. We have also notice that the problem doesn’t only exist in PMB it’s all over,” says Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Zweli Mkhize. Many blame the non enforcement of by-laws which force some businesses to leave the city. “It was very difficult for those business to sustain themselves because customers no longer want to come to town because they had to go through people that were intimidating them lack of public toilets in the town means deification all over the streets urine everywhere it became very unpleasant,” says CEO Pietermaritzburg Chamber of Business, Melanie Veness.   The good green deeds clean-up campaign is the last bid to save the city. “We also launching what we call our yellow plant as the department of co-operative government and traditional affairs yellow plants include all the plants and equipment that you can think of that will be using to assist municipalities. We found that the number of municipalities are cash trapped they are using a lot of their money in renting plants so we have tractors roller plants we have graders that can assist municipalities,”KZN COGTA MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube.   The campaign will be rolled out to other towns in the province, starting with the economic hubs like Durban and Richards Bay.
