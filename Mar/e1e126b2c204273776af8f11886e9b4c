Police have confirmed the arrest of a suspect in the Babes Wodumo case. Artist Bongekile Simelane, who is also known as Babes Wodumo, opened an assault case on Monday against her boyfriend. This after a video went viral showing Mampintsha allegedly assaulting Babes Wodumo. He was arrested in Westville in Durban on Tuesday afternoon. National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo confirms the arrest. “I can confirm that the suspect in the Babes Wodumo case has been arrested and he is currently in police custody. We’re hoping to process him as soon as possible and bring him before court soon. It will depend on how long it takes us to process him and the law does allow us 48 hours in which to finalise our processes before we take him to court. So it can be anytime from now before the 48 hour expiration period.” The Kwaito artist Mampintsha has also laid a counter charge of assault against his girlfriend Babes Wodumo. This has been confirmed by his lawyer Pat Magwaza.
