A call by President Cyril Ramaposa for a clean and safe environment is receiving attention from the Eastern Cape. The Good Green Deeds programme, which will be launched in East London, is aimed at promoting sustainable waste management practices such as recycling.  A factory in Mdantsane is making waste pay by collecting plastic materials for recycling purposes.  Littering, illegal dumping and other forms of pollution all have harmful effects on the environment both on land and at sea. Citizens are encouraged to view waste as something that can be recycled. CEO of Afro Waste Group, Phumeza Ceshemba from Mdantsane, saw a gap in the market and made collecting plastic her everyday business. The initiative has created much needed jobs. “We’ve got lots of contracts, mostly in East London; they convert what we doing, which is pellets, and into oil. There is a huge demand for pellets…One day I would love to be able to produce one of the products. The recycling industry does not end where you do the pellets, if I can be able to produce one product even if it’s a jug.”  Employee of Afro Waste Groups, Nonkosi Nazo, says the job has changed her life financially. “My life has changed financially because I’m able to support my five year old girl and I’m able to buy things at home and pay for transport.” The Department of Environment Affairs has pledged to assist towards the growth of the factory. Surprise Zwane, Technical Unit Manager for chemical and waste at the department, says that they are happy to assist. “For me, it’s to say ‘how do we assist her to get to the next level and assist her to lead with other big players because waste is quantity?’ Same if you show capacity, we view her as one of the people who are already at runway ready to get to commercial stage.” President Ramaphosa is expected to officially launch the Good Deeds programme on Friday.
