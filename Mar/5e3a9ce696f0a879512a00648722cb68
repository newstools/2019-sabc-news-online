KZN police are investigating after a family of five were found shot dead at their home in Montclair, south of Durban. They say the father, Sandile Mkhize, allegedly shot dead his wife and their three children – before turning the gun on himself. Mkhize was a senior court interpreter and his wife – a well-known magistrate at the Durban Magistrates’ Court. Neighbours have described the family as humble and say the incident was unexpected. Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane says a gun was found on the scene with no evidence of a break-in. “The Montclair police will open four counts of murder as well as one inquest docket for further investigation. All of them have gunshot wounds on their bodies and we also found a firearm. It is not clear at this stage what really happened.” Click on video below:
