President Cyril Ramaphosa says government will be meeting with organisations representing the truck drivers in the country soon. Ramaphosa was speaking on SABC Radio station Ukhozi FM. Last week, seven trucks were burnt on the N3 near Mooi River during a violent protest. The highway was closed to traffic for several hours. Ramaphosa says such actions are chasing away investors. “If people are aggrieved especially those driving trucks they should not go and burn trucks. If they burn the trucks on an important road where the whole world can see it resulting in the closure of the road, people from other countries will have an impression that South Africa is a country that is faced by serious problems.” “As people destroy and burn down infrastructure that is not acceptable. We will be speaking to the organisation of truck drivers.”
