MK veteran and founding member, Joel Cardin Ngalo, has been laid to rest at his home in Ephewuleni Village in Middledrift, Eastern Cape. Ngalo died at the age of 82 after a short illness. He was among the few surviving members of the Luthuli Detachment who went to exile in 1963. Ngalo was given a Category 2 State Provincial Funeral. People came in their numbers to bid farewell to a man who dedicated his life to the liberation struggle. Ngalo has been hailed as a patriot who joined the liberation struggle when it wasn’t fashionable to do so. He worked with the likes of O.R Tambo and Moses Kotane while in Tanzania in the 1960s. He spent 30 years in exile before his return to the country in 1991. ANC Veterans League president, Snuki Zikalala, says Ngalo served with distinction and honour. Zikalala has described Ngalo as a rare breed as he expected no gain while dedicating his life for the liberation of the oppressed. His family says his name should not be forgotten. Nephew Morris Bafana Ngalo says his uncle contributed a lot to the liberation struggle. He also expressed gratitude for the state funeral and urged the ANC to engrave Ngalo’s name in the history books. The party’s Veterans League used the occasion to urge the ANC to deal with controversial figures appearing on its parliamentary list to honour the integrity of the organisation. They have also promised to campaign for the party leading up to the general elections.
