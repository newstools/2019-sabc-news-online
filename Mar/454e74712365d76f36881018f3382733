The South African government has backed Iran in its stand-off with the US. The Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal that was signed with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It was aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The deal, otherwise known as the JCOPA, was signed by the US, Britain, Germany, France, Russia, China and the EU in 2015. However, the Trump administration unilaterally pulled out and threatened any other country that does business with Iran with sanctions.  South Africa is among the countries that suffered from the US sanctions on Iran. It’s unable to access Iran’s crude oil, while its private companies such as MTN are unable to repatriate billions of rands from their profits in Iran. On Friday, the government described the US action as highly regrettable. “The JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in resolution. of governors and the general council,” says Dirco Deputy Minister, Reginah Mhaule. Iran says although they are facing tough times as a result of sanctions with the support from countries such as South Africa, they will survive. “It is now a difficult time because of the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCOPA. They threatening sanctions if they stay in the JCOPA,”says Iran Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abbas Araghchi. The two countries are discussing how to strengthen diplomatic relations with sanctions again Iran.
