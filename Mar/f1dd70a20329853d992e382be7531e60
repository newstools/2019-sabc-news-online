Police say preliminary investigations suggest that robbery could have been the motive for the murder of Mondeor High School learner Khulani Mathebula. Mathebula was stabbed in the chest while on his way to school on Wednesday morning. Three suspects have been arrested. Two 15-year-old suspects were arrested in Soweto and Naturena, south of Johannesburg on Thursday morning. The first suspect who is aged 13 was arrested at a school also in Mondeor in the south of Johannesburg. He was found in possession of a knife which police believe could have been used in the murder of Mathebula.  Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says: “As we are investigation we think that it might be a robbery but however the police are continuously investigating as to determine what actually was the motive of the killing of this boy.” Meanwhile, the Gauteng Department of Education has welcomed the arrests. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says: “I want to thank everyone, the local business people who gave us footage, the neighbouring schools who co-operated with us and all those that were involved in this matter. I hope and wish that the families of those that have been arrested will be brave enough to confront the family of the deceased and say they are sorry.” “This is a pain that no family must go through and this is a period that we need to give support to this family so they can be consoled and supported,” adds Lesufi.
