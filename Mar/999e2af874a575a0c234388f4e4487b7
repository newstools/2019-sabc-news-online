Eskom has confirmed that the power grid is stable and that no load-shedding is forecast for this week. Last week, the power utility faced a few technical difficulties which resulted in stage one load-shedding. “At this stage we are looking very good. The technical problems which we had encountered last week have been resolved and overall the improvement has been good and we are pleased to say that the outlook for this week is no load-shedding,” says Eskom’s Acting Heads of Generation Andrew Eitzinger.
