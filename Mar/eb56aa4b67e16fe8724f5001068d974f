International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has called on the law enforcement agencies to immediately act against violence, criminal activities and looting of properties of foreign nationals. Sisulu has cautioned all South Africans to stand up against lawlessness. On Saturday, Sisulu convened an urgent meeting with African ambassadors in Pretoria to discuss the way forward after recent violence against foreigners in Durban. Departmental spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya says the meeting focussed on how government can work with communities and all stakeholders to foster integration in communities. “The Minister received a briefing about the state of violence and damage to property. She requested a meeting with African Ambassadors on how we can work together to build bridges to foster integration and involve other stakeholders like community leaders and political parties to discuss ways to address the challenges that we have.” “The Minister made a call that police law enforcement agencies across the country must deal with these criminals without fear or favour.”  Related Video
