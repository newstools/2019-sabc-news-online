Creating jobs, improving policing and ensuring cheaper electricity are what the Democratic Alliance (DA) is promising should it govern Gauteng. The party’s top brass accompanied Gauteng Premier Candidate Solly Msimanga to the Saulsville Arena in Atteridgeville, west of Pretoria, where the DA launched its 2019 provincial election manifesto. Unveiling the provincial election manifesto party leader Mmusi Maimane has promised to create jobs, improve policing and ensure cheaper electricity should the DA govern. “I have a dream for this country. Here’s the dream; when 40% of our houses and our homes in South Africa don’t have a single job in them, I don’t think that’s good enough. I want to give my life to making sure that in every home in this country, there’s at least one person who has a job.” Msimanga has highlighted the importance of controlling immigration and ending corruption during the launch of the party’s 2019 provincial election manifesto. “We are not xenophobic and we will never fight with our brothers and sisters, but we believe that everybody who is in Gauteng in South Africa must be here legally and we believe that there should never be a foreign national who is here and is owning (sic) an RDP house before locals get an RDP house. We believe that we should make sure that where people are employed, South Africans are given priority in terms of employment. If we can do that we will get the economy going.”
