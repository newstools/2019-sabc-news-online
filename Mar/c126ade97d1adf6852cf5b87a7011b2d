Public lecture by Professor Francis Fukuyama , senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International studies at Stanford University, on the role of the State in Development. Professor Fukuyama, one of the worldâ€™s leading and most influential political philosophers, has devoted the past decade to studying the history of political organisation in societies across the world. He focuses on the forces that lead some states to become effective, democratic and committed to the rule of law, and the dynamics that inhibit this elsewhere.
