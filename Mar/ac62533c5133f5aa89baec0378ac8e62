Non-Governmental Organisation – Corruption Watch has recommended to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts SCOPA in the North West, to appoint a commission of inquiry to probe allegation of corrupt activities into mining royalties at the Bakwena ba Mogopa community in Ventersdorp. It is alleged that a lot of money is missing in the D-account which mining companies have paid as royalties. The Bakwena ba Mogopa, have requested Corruption Watch to assist them in investigating the alleged corruption. Modibe More is a community leader: “We are not happy at all with how the D-account is being run, because the government which is supposed to be monitoring our money, is involved.  The money has been put in that account since the 1960’s, being put in our trust account in Bethanie until recently. Now when we enquire about that money we are not getting answers… even documents are not available.” Corruption Watch Head of Legal and Investigations, Deborah Mutemwa Tumbo, says they will ensure that a commission of inquiry into this matter is been established. “I think we have pointed out the problem and as Corruption Watch we will do as much as we can to ensure that those who are directly implicated are found out and brought to book; and I think of our main recommendations or one of the things we want to achieve following this is that some sort of commission of inquiry is held so that witnesses those are involved can be summonsed so that we can get to the crux of the matter and root out the truth.”
