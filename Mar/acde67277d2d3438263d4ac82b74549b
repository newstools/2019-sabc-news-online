Police Minister Bheki Cele has conceded that promotions in the police service are long overdue. He was addressing the media following the reported threats of a national strike by members of the police force starting on Monday over a lack of promotions. Police unions Popcru and Sapu have distanced themselves from the looming strike.  Cele says it would take three financial years to promote 45 000 members of the police force. He also says the process of promoting police officers would cost R2 billion. “As the SAPS, we have responded positively to the Thuma Mina call and delivered beyond the set target of promoting 32 053 members in a period of one financial year. This has not happened before in the history of this organisation. Meanwhile, we admit that the implementation process by police management has got some gaps and it needs to be improved with speed in addressing some of the genuine concerns.” WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
