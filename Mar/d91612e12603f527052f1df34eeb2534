Azapo and Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) military veterans have threatened to make the Free State government ungovernable if their demands for decent housing are not met. About 350 ex-soldiers marched to the Human Settlements Department in Welkom to hand over a memorandum of grievances. They claim the provincial government’s R48 million housing project for them has collapsed. The ex-soldiers are up in arms accusing the Free State government of reneging on agreements to build them houses. Most of them are unemployed and stay in backyard rooms in the Lejweleptswa district in Welkom. The houses they claim belong to them are incomplete. Ex-Azanla combatant Morapedi Botipe says:”If they are not responding within seven days we are going to sleep there, we will go with our children and wives, pillows and blankets.” Ex-Apla combatants Samuel Bani say:”ANC is not doing any favours for us, we did this to white domination era, and it is very simple to do it now, ANC is nothing.” Authorities admitted that there were delays in allocating homes to some of the veterans. Human Settlement-Spokesperson Senne Bogatsu says:”We are in a process of ensuring these houses are complete. The delay was caused by a number of issues including administration issues.” The department has promised to respond to the memorandum.
