President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the country to be patient with the electricity blackouts, saying one of the pylons in Mozambique that supply Eskom with electricity, is about to go back online. Power lines from the Cahora Bassa dam that supply Eskom with hydroelectricity have been damaged by Cyclone Idai. Ramaphosa says he was on Friday morning briefed by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan that the pylon that has been fixed will be able to produce 900 megawatts of power. Ramaphosa was on the campaign trail in Cape Town ahead of the National elections in May.  He told the cheering crowd at an African National Congress (ANC) rally in Mfuleni that electricity blackouts will soon be a thing of the past. He urged residents to go and vote for the ANC on May 8. “Minister Pravin Gordhan told me this morning that one of the pylons is being fixed, it’s about to produce 900 megawatts so we are busy fixing Eskom. I plead with you not to lose hope; we will fix it so that we have electricity on an uninterrupted basis.” Ramaphosa says the ANC government is working hard to deliver services to people. He has asked the voters of Cape Town to vote the Democratic Alliance (DA) out of power in May so that their problems are also addressed. “When we look closely at the lives of our people that is when we see that they are a government that does not care for the lives of our people. That is when we see that their interests are only for the rich people here in the Western Cape that is when we see that they have no interest at all for the people who live in our townships.” Ramaphosa says the ANC government is aware of housing backlogs, lack of schools and joblessness, saying they are working hard at fixing those problems.
