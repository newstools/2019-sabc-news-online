Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, is on Thursday expected to meet with taxi operators in the Vaal in Vereeniging and inspect the local taxi rank. This follows a protest over the incomplete work in the taxi rank and potholes in the area. On Wednesday, Transport MEC Ismael Vadi met with disgruntled operators from various associations after they began with day one of their seven day shutdown in the area. Operators blocked major routes declaring the first day of a seven-day shutdown. The parties described the meeting as a successful one with taxi operators agreeing to stop protest action completely.  Makhura met with taxi associations in Sharpeville, Vereeniging earlier on Thursday. Operators demanded the release of all members arrested during the protests on Wednesday, however, the Premier said government cannot interfere with the independence of police. Makhura and Vadi are expected to visit the rank with associations for an inspection after the Human Rights Day celebrations in the area.
