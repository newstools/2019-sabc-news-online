The Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, says he will be meeting with all station commanders of 1 147 police stations in the country, including provincial and national management of the SAPS on Monday, 18 March 2019 in Pretoria. Cele says police management will embark on a process of a vigorous internal communication approach to take all members on board in understanding the promotion process and its phases. He was addressing the media after the South African Police Union (SAPU) threatened to embark on a national strike, accusing the government of taking police for granted. “I would like to call upon all disciplined members of the SAPS nationally; to take the leadership into full confidence in that, this matter of promotions will be further addressed with the speed it deserves to benefit the entire SAPS family and amicably with all parties involved, including labour unions,” says Cele. He says the SAPS admits that the implementation process by police management has got gaps and it needs to be improved with speed in addressing some of the genuine concerns raised.
