The ANC has instructed its Provincial Working Committee to decide on the fate of two KwaZulu-Natal mayors on Monday, who have been arrested in connection with political killings. Harry Gwala mayor, Mluleki Ndobe and three others will apply for bail in connection with the murder of former ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa at the Umzimkhulu Magistrate’s court. On Friday, Newcastle mayor, Ntuthuko Mahlaba was arrested for murder and will appear in court Monday. ANC spokesperson, Dakota Legoete, says they’ve instructed the provincial leadership to decide on the matter. “We’ve instructed the PWC in KZN to sit as early as tomorrow to pronounce itself in line with due processes. Tomorrow it will sit to pronounce itself so that we don’t misstep our constitutional provisions as an organisation. But our message is very clear is that we cannot have serving mayors in custody because the community needs services on a daily basis. So the leadership there will have to take the right decisions which will be in the interests of the residents.” Video Below:
