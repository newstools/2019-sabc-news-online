Minister for Public Service and Administration, Ayanda Dlodlo has on Monday noted the outcome of the ethics committee regarding her non-disclosure of details pertaining to 2016 trip. Dlodlo says she fully respects the decision of the ethics committee. “The committee found that my interpretation of family members fell short of the committee’s own definition of a family member in terms of the executive ethics code.” “As the record will show, I have been fully transparent and truthful about my trip and the fact that Hlongwane paid for my accommodation,” adds the Minister, arguing that “It was my own admission that served as the basis from which Honourable Van Damme submitted a request to the ethics committee to investigate.” Dlodlo says she adheres to the Parliamentary legal codes and do not wish to act contrary to any of them. “I therefore appreciate and welcome the fact that as part of the sanction, I will be counselled on all aspects of the code.”
