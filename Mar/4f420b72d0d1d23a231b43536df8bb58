The National Teachers Union (NATU) has reacted to the deaths of three learners by saying the lack of visible policing on roads especially in KwaZulu-Natal townships contributes to road accidents. Three pupils were run over allegedly by a taxi. They had been walking to school in KwaMashu, north of Durban. NATU president, Allen Thompson says parents have put their hopes, trust and the safety of their children in the hands of the police. He says traffic police and the South African Police Service (SAPS) officers should be deployed on street corners. “The hopes of all the parents are in our police services. That is why we are saying, not only the SA Police Service must be part of the patrol, but we are also calling the Traffic Department in the republic. We need to see them in the morning from 6 o’clock to ensure that all the learners are safe going to school. Our learners are being exposed to people who are stealing on their way to school and that thing can be dealt with should the police in the Republic of SA make themselves available in the morning; so the criminals, there is no space for them to operate,” says Thompson.
