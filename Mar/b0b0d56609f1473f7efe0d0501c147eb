Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she has decided to name and shame those that have not implemented her remedial action to stop the trend from continuing. The ministers of Police, Defence, Higher Education, Public Service and Administration and Finance as well as 38 organs of state have not implemented Mkhwebane’s remedial action. Others are Eskom, the City of Tshwane, the City of Johannesburg, several district municipalities, National Treasury, the Johannesburg Road Agency and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. Mkhwebane told the media in Pretoria on Thursday that taking her recommendations on review did not mean that the implementation of the remedial action should be ignored. “This is an act of appealing to the conscience and morality of the culprits by publishing details of their misdeeds, with a view to sparking a public discourse on the plights of the complainants. The idea is that, in the end, public pressure should cajole them to do the right thing. It is indeed a tragedy that all these powers we possess, we have had to resort to this way of doing things,” says Mkhwebane. Watch a related video below:
