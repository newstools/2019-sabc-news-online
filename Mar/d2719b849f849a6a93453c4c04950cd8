Women in Kenya are to hold peaceful protests in major cities across the country to demand an end to Gender Based Violence. According to Counting Dead, a local non-Governmental organisation, at least 25 women have been killed by their intimate partners between January and last month. The march will be held, in the capital Nairobi, the Port City of Mombasa and the Lakeside city of Kisumu. These, are some of the major towns where women have met their deaths in the hands of their husbands, boyfriends or lovers. The killings have sent shock waves across the country but there is no conviction yet. The women are demanding action to end these killings and to bring to book those accused of the killings. The women will also demand that the countryâ€™s parliament passes a law that requires that no more than two-thirds of any elected or appointed body can be of the same gender. Previous attempts to vote on the bill have flopped, largely due to quorum hitches. Click on video below:
