Gauteng Premier David Makhura says he will be guided by the ANC’s Integrity Committee on what action to take against Sport MEC Faith Mazibuko, amid public calls that he must fire her after a recording of her abusive address to staff emerged. The Premier says he has already reprimanded Mazibuko. He says he made it clear that what she said to two of her executives was totally unacceptable. In an audio recording,  Mazibuko is heard speaking harshly to the officials, in which she was demanding that they must at all cost deliver combi courts, or resign. She made it clear that she wanted to use the combi courts as part of the ANC’s campaign for the May 8 general elections and also implied she did the executives a favour by hiring them – despite their race. Makhura’s spokesperson Castro Ngobese says:”There are growing calls in public that Premier Makhura must take a particular decision, regarding MEC Mazibuko. The premier will follow due processes, because also the governing party, the ANC, has referred the matter to their Integrity Committee of which the premier will be following that process.” Related video click below:
