The bodies of two young boys have been found in a swimming pool of a house in Mahikeng in the North West on Thursday night. The bodies match those of two 10-year-olds who were kidnapped on Tuesday night. The discovery of the bodies has angered the community of Imperial Reserve, who threatened to set the house alight. A high contingency of police have been deployed to the area. Some community members clashed with the police, as they wanted to torch the house that they believed is being used as a drug den. It was reported on Tuesday that two 10-year-old boys were kidnapped after being lured with a packet of chips to a vehicle with three occupants. Police spokesperson Lesedi Dingoko says after thorough investigations, they managed to discover two bodies matching those that were reported missing. The parents have confirmed to the SABC that the bodies are that of their children who were playing at Montshioa park on Tuesday, when they were kidnapped. Currently no one has been arrested as investigations are still underway.
