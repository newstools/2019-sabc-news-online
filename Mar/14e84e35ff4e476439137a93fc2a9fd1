The death toll has increased to more than six after heavy storms swept through KwaZulu-Natal, especially in KwaMashu, north of Durban, over the weekend. The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs have confirmed that the number of the deceased is likely to increase as mop up operations are continuing. Department Spokesperson Lennox Mabaso says the exact figure of the deceased is not yet known at this stage. “I can confirm that we have received some more bodies and indeed the death toll is likely to increase based on the work that we continue to do. It’s the first clear day where we are able to do everything that we want to do unhindered. Responding to all the missing people and bringing in our resources including our dog unit and search and rescue team in full steam to go out and ensure that what people have reported well be able to provide answers to,” says Mabaso.
