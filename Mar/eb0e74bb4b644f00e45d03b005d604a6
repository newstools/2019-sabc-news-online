ANC Youth League Secretary General, Njabulo Nzuza, says although there are widespread allegations of corruption against its members, the party is doing its best to ensure corrupt officials are brought to book. The ANC has made headlines over the past few months – with several of its members being linked to testimonies at various commissions of inquiry. Nzuza was speaking during the SABC’s Big Debate show, discussing current affairs issues. “It is willing to act and it has displayed its ability to act. There are law structures that are set up and there were issues raised on State Capture,” he defended, saying “It was the ANC that established it. As the ANC we also have what we call the integrity commission which deals with these issues.” Nzuza says “What set us apart is that we do not when one of our own is alleged to be corrupt call a press briefing to defend that person. We say step aside and allow for the process to cleanse you.” ‘DA acts swiftly to hold members to account’ DA MP, Makashule Gana, has defended his party – saying they act swiftly to hold their members to account when allegations are placed before them. DA Veteran MP, Dianne Kohler-Barnard is reportedly being taken to the Equality Court over her remarks on rock-throwing incidents on the N2 Highway in KZN – in which she implied that black youths were targeting white motorists. Speaking during SABC’s Big Debate, Gana says Kohler-Barnard was referred to the court by a DA member. “The issue of Dianne is before the Equality Court. So why is she on the list? That is the point, that someone who is accused should not be on the list. The matter is before the Equality Court. The person who referred the matter to the Equality Court is a DA manager of operations in parliament. When someone is accused, we don’t wait for any party or any member of the public to tell us what to do as soon as the allegations are put before us.” Click video below:
