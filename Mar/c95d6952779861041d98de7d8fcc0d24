The Durban High Court has heard that Thabani Mzolo who allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend, Zolile Khumalo, at a Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student residence, was never searched by security before entering the premises. The court heard evidence by Mfundo Mpungose, the student who signed Mzolo in to enter the building. Mzolo faces a charge of murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm, and ammunition. Mpungose, a former MUT student, appeared nervous as he took to the witness stand at the Durban High Court. In his testimony, Mpungose told the court that he was the one who had signed Mzolo in, at the institution’s student residence Lonsdale Hotel. Mzolo’s ex-girlfriend Zolile Khumalo who was also residing in this residence was shot and killed, allegedly by Mzolo. According to Mpungose, Mzolo called him and asked to sign him in as he wanted to take a quick bath. The court heard that Mzolo was a regular visitor at this residence and was also known by the security guards. Mpungose told the court that Mzolo was carrying a small bag but that none of the security had checked to see what was inside. He said once Mzolo was given the authority to enter the premises, Mzolo told him that he would take a bath at his friend’s room, Smiso. Mzolo explained that he went back to his room to study as he was writing an exam the following day. He told the court that as visiting hours were nearing to an end, he went to Smiso’s room to look for Mzolo so he could sign him out, but did not find him. Mpungose said he heard an unusual sound coming from a lower floor which made students curious. He said he and other students rushed down to see what was happening. Mpungose told the court that he was informed that Mzolo had allegedly shot and killed Zolile. Mpungose was taken in for questioning but was later released. The court heard that after the incident, Mpungose was expelled by the Institution. The trial continues on Monday. Related video click below:
