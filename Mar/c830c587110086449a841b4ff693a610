The man accused of raping a seven-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Silverton, Pretoria last year, is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning. He faces charges of possession of drugs, intimidation and rape after he allegedly forced the girl into the men’s toilets where he raped her. In his last court appearance the suspect was found fit to stand trial after a 30-day psychiatric evaluation that the court had ordered. He was referred to the Weskopies psychiatric hospital after it was submitted to the court that he suffered from bipolar disorder and had been abusing drugs from the age of 14. The man allegedly raped the child in September last year. A trial date is expected to set and the matter transferred to the high court. Click on videos below:
