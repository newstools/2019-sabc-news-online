The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) says it will soon write to the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) to request it to give more clarity on its decision to suspend the collection of e-toll debt. On Wednesday, SANRAL said it would not apply for new summonses against e-toll defaulters. This followed the SANRAL board’s decision to suspend the collection of historic e-toll debt that dates back to 2015. SANRAL says the roads agency’s board will constantly monitor and review the decision, according to prevailing circumstances. Watch a related video below:
