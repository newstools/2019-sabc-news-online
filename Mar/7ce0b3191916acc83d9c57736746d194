The North West Education Department says security personnel will be provided at 200 schools across the province, starting from April 1. The Department will also form a standing committee that will investigate safety and security measures in schools. The decisions were taken at the provincial school safety summit in Rustenburg, this week. This comes as the province experiences a wave of violence in schools which in most cases resulted in injuries, killings and damage to property. Education MEC Sello Lehari says, “We are going to appoint 200 security personnel in 200 schools in the province particularly for the schools where there is lot of risk and threat. We have made our own assessment and analysis; we have identified those 200 schools.” “On top of that we are going to establish a safety standing committee consisting of 12 people. The main purpose for the safety standing committee is to report from all incidents and to monitor the resolution from the summit.” The National Association of School Governing Bodies has made a call on parents to be more involved in their children’s education. The association’s North West secretary Tladi Sedikane says, “In most cases you will find that the parents neglect the responsibility of ensuring that they become part of education of our learners. So we have presented in the summit that the department should come up with programmes that will inculcate that parental involvement is important.” Click on video below:
