The Public Investment Corporation has appointed its executive head of properties, Vuyani Haki as acting CEO after putting Matshepo More on precautionary suspension. More’s suspension follows allegations of interference in the process of the Judiciary Commission of Inquiry into impropriety at the corporation. Her suspension comes several weeks after the PIC’s board of directors tendered its resignation because of allegations of wrongdoing by four directors. The Public Servants Association’s spokesperson, Tahir Maepa says the entire board of the PIC should be removed. “The people who suspended the acting CEO are the very same people who by law they are not a legitimate board, they have resigned as board members. We don’t understand why the minister of finance is keeping those people there; some of them have been implicated in serious allegations. As an organisation, we are consulting our lawyers about their legitimacy. It looks like they are trying to fire as many people as possible so that they cover their shortcoming as a board.”
