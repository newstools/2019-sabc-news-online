The African National Congress (ANC) has welcomed the release of the High Level Review Panel’s report on the State Security Agency (SSA). President Cyril Ramaphosa authorised the publication of the report on Saturday night. The report has assessed the mandate, capacity and organisational integrity of the SSA. The key finding of the report is that there has been political malpurposing and factionalisation of the intelligence community over the past decade or more. Without saying he is aware of what was happening at the SSA, former State Security Minister and Member of the ANC Sub-Committee on Peace and Security David Mahlobo says they support the President in his quest to restore the integrity of government’s intelligence unit.
