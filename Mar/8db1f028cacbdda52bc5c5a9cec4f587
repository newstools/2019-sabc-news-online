Eskom says there are currently no plans to implement Stage 5 and Stage 6 loadshedding. This is contrary to reports in some media. South Africans have been experiencing Stage 4 loadshedding since Saturday. The embattled power utility says the current power problems are a result of Cyclone Idai which has gripped Mozambique as well as maintenance issues at various power plants. Eskom’s Andrew Ertiznger says they are confident that they can manage the current situation. Watch video below for more on the story:  The Mozambique cyclone has cut power exports to South Africa from the Cahora Bassa hydro-electric facility. This has contributed to Eskom’s power shortfall. The embattled power utility says it cannot guarantee that loadshedding will soon be a thing of past. The country is currently enduring severe stage four loadshedding. Eskom Chairperson Jabu Mabuza has vowed that measures have been put in place to avoid a total blackout. He’s been speaking in a media address alongside Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, and is appealing to South Africans to understand the nature of the challenges the power utility faces. “In the crisis mode that we find ourselves, we would have to look at those skills that are critical and essential. We are allowed to provide for a certain load factor using diesel. We have exceeded outside the acceptable level, but in meeting the demand to try and avoid a total blackout, we do believe we are still very far from that point. If the demand continues to be outside the equilibrium it’s going to collapse the system.”
