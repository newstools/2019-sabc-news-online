Former Deputy Minister of Finance, Mcebisi Jonas, will on Friday be cross-examined by the legal team of Fana Hlongwane and Duduzane Zuma at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. On Thursday, former Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene, said efforts by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to discredit him before his appearance before the Commission in 2018 may relate to their failed attempts to influence his final decision of placing VBS Bank under curatorship. Nene said in March 2018, he received an sms from EFF second-in-command, Floyd Shivambu asking him to make a favourable decision in the VBS matter. Nene said he resigned because it was revealed that he had previously lied about his engagements with the Gupta family during a news television interview with eNCA in 2015. He says he was caught off guard by the question and he took the easy way out, which was inappropriate. Watch Thursdayâ€™s proceedings in video below:
