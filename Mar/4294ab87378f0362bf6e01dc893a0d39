The Judicial commission of inquiry into State Capture has on Monday morning resumed hearings with Khathatso Tlhakudi who is the current DDG of Business Enhancement Services at the Department of Public Enterprises. Tlhakudi has told the Commission that he once worked at the state owned aerospace and military technology conglomerate Denel but left in 2014. Under the department of Public Enterprise he has oversight over the whole of Denel including its divisions, its subsidiaries as well as its associate companies. Tlhakudi is giving testimony on governance related matters at the parastatal. “Besides Denel, I am also responsible for Alexco, which is a diamond mining company located in the Northern Cape.” “Having oversight over these entities, you need various skills. I am  an engineer and I have financial analysts that are supported and headed by chief financial analysts and you have to know the dynamics of that particular sector in order to interpret the financials as we receive them.”  Click video below:
