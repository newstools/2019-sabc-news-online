Long running political battles in Metsimaholo Local Municipality in the Northern Free State have left residents desperately deprived of service delivery. The South African Communist Party (SACP) led coalition government has, since the last local government elections, struggled to reign in participating political parties. Political parties unwilling to work together in Metsimaholo Local Municipality in the Free State have resulted in roads in bad condition, unfinished RDP houses and a R22-million multi-purpose centre that is incomplete. Metsimaholo Resident Meikie Motlou explains, “The Municipality announced the building of a multi-purpose centre years ago; they left without starting it. Now this place is becoming too dangerous for children. People are even getting killed here. Projects in our area never get completed.” Neglected projects have also negatively impacted the lives of residents. Another resident Vusile Moqwathi says “I studied towards a soccer coaching certificate hoping that I would do my practical’s here at this complex, now that it is incomplete I can’t get my certificate; it is holding me back. There are many young people here who would be great soccer players but now they are smoking nyaope. In desperate need for shelter, some have resorted to building sacks in their yards. “There are many unfinished RDP houses, some completed the houses themselves but others like my uncle died waiting for their houses. Others here don’t even have electricity” says Mollelo Tshume a resident from Metsimaholo. The SACP in the province have conceded that there are server service delivery challenges but it believes the coalition is doing fairly well. The ANC on the other hand believes that it could do better alone. Metsimaholo Local Municipality speaker Thabo Mabaso says “We are trying to pull together but I will agree if it was the African National Congress alone governing this municipality, we could have done more.” Click on video below:
