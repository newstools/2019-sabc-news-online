Government has set up a National Action Plan to combat discrimination. Its aim is to provide direction to activists and institutions dealing with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and any other form of intolerance. The legacy of a divided past continues to undermine the South African nation. Racism, Xenophobia and other forms of discrimination remain a blight on our democracy. The South African Human Rights Commission’s Advocate Bongani Majola they want to combat racism. “Our trends analysis report has identified the number of complaints relating to equality, particularly those relating to discrimination based on race as being the highest this has sparked concerns of whether the scourge or racism is on the rise.” Abigail Noko from the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reiterated this. “It is a call to all of us to condemn notions of racial superiority or hatred always incite racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerants.”  In 2001, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance adopted the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It urged countries to establish and implement policies to fight any form of intolerance. It was launched in honour of the late struggle activist Ahmed Kathrada. Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffreys says combating racism should be a united effort. “If Uncle Kathy were here as we launch the nap, I’m sure he would remind us of his words when he said that, the fight for non-racialism equity and equality is not short term work but generational work, it requires a united effort and a lifetime of commitment.”
