Mourners at the funeral of the 17-year-old Northern Cape pupil who was stabbed to death have described him as a principled young man. Boniface Ndlovu, from Emmanuel Secondary School in Kimberley, was killed last Sunday when he and a group of friends were attacked by 10 men.  Ndlovu was allegedly killed for his matric dance shoes. His mother bought them for him with her social grant money and her meagre savings. Classmate Andrea Grondt says she will never forget the young man who has touched many lives. “He was a young, principled man, 17 years of age. One can’t get someone as principled at such a young age. His parents did a great, valuable job at raising such a young man and it is very sad to lose someone who influenced a whole lot of us. He was a top student and someone I could talk to, but now it feels empty. I know he isn’t here, but spiritually I know he is sitting there looking over us.” Mourners were inconsolable, saying they lost a hero. His family, friends and the community still trying to come to terms with the tragedy. No arrests have been made. Ndlovu’s dream was to become a military doctor, but his dream was cut short. Loved ones say they will cherish the good memories. He leaves behind a mother, father and four siblings. FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
