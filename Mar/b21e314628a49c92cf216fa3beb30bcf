Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi will continue to testify before the Commission of Inquire into State Capture when the hearings resume in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday morning. Earlier, Agrizzi repeated his claim that Bosasa paid for security upgrades at the house of ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe, who was the party’s secretary-general at the time. Earlier this year, Mantashe refuted Agrizzi’s testimony about Bosasa paying for upgrades at his house. Agrizzi also said Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson told him that Mantashe was a great connection between the company and the ANC due to his position in the party. “What I think is important is that one understands that at first Gavin was elusive. He said to me that he didn’t know about it, then he admitted and when he admitted to me he explained to me why. He says I’m telling you it was done because Mantashe is a brilliant connection to have. At that stage he was the SG and who controls the rest of the people is the SG. That’s what I was told.”
