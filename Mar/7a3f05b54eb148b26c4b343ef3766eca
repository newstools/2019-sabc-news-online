The School Governing Body of the Uitsig Secondary School at Elsie’s River in Cape Town is preparing to approach the Constitutional Court in a bid to keep the school open. This, after the Western Cape Department of Education earmarked the school for closure. Both the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the department. 120 pupils from Grade 8 to 12 still attend Uitsig Secondary. In 2017, the department announced its closure, citing dwindling numbers, a low pass rate and major vandalism as reasons. Children were accommodated at nearby schools when the decision to close it was taken. Parents however, say their children are not safe travelling to the other schools. Uitsig Secondary School’s SBG member, Sharon Koeberg says that the school is in their hearts: “This school has stood the test of time. I am in my 50’s now and this school has opened up many opportunities for many learners. It’s part of our history. So many memories have been made here.” The area has three primary schools.
